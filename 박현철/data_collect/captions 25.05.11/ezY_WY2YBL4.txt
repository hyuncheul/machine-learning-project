You're right, guys. It's Game Boy Luke

Nintendo Direct. No more than well,
actually just over a week from the last
Nintendo Direct we had, I think, to see
the Switch One off. And now today, we
have a Nintendo Direct for the Nintendo
Switch 2. And apparently, we have an
hour's worth of content awaiting us
about news about this new console. Maybe
we'll get game releases. I'm sure
they're going to talk about like launch
titles and stuff like that. the
specifications of the Switch 2 and the
rest of that kind of stuff, too. I'm
very, very excited for this. I mean, I'm
obviously a Pokemon fan, but I was
originally like a Nintendo fan. Uh, and
I am still at heart. So, I'm very, very
excited to see what kind of news we get
from this direct. Uh, and I hope you
guys are, too. I'm going to chat with my
uh, YouTube chat for a bit and then
we're going to jump straight into the
reaction. Of course, if you're watching
this after the fact, make sure you
subscribe, hit the notification bell so
you don't miss out on live reactions
like this in the future, and I'm sure

Nick, I'm coming for you. Come on. No.
Introducing Game Chat, a new feature for
Nintendo Switch 2. Yo, we're living in
the future. Hey, what's up? Can you hear
me? Hello. Hi. Miss you. With this
feature, you'll be able to communicate
with friends and family while playing a
game. Should we follow you? Yeah. All
right. Go. Okay. For an
adventure. While using the game chat
feature, your voice is recognized by a
microphone built into the console. Oh,
the audio is going to be dog. Still
behind me, right? All right, let's keep
going. Go game. It can pick up your
speaking voice clearly even from a
distance. Are you sure about that? Oh,
the volume from the the console. Make a
left right here. Let's make a When it's
noisy around you, your voice will still
come through clearly. Are you sure about
that?
Okay, nice. Nice. If there's at least a
headset accessory that you can still
plug in and use with this, I mean that's
cool, right? Handheld mode too, letting
you easily chat with friends and family.
If you
open sharing, bro, this is this is the
future. We are in the future. We have
scored on this on this. Oh my god, the
frame rates are awful. Go on top of that
dinosaur. Really? They can do that. You

[Music]
The frame rates are pretty bad, but this

content, even while playing different
games. Fight. Yeah, I know that one.
It's so hard, right? So Oh, wow. I'm
like in the sky right here. I'm a f I'm
falling. I'm falling. I'm falling. Okay,
we got it. We're safe. We're Kirby,
look, you're a star. That's so cute.
You're so cute.
I mean, this is cool. Adjust the size of
your game screen. Is this Discord,
guys? Discord.
[Music]
There's a guy copying her homework
screen.
Yo, the Yo, you guys. Okay. Above that
wall. You guys can't be selling it to me
with the frame rate looking like that,
guys. Aren't we real? Like, if she gets
past the wall, guys. Guys, seriously,
guys, this is
okay. So, everyone can watch them play.
Oh, I think I I think I know where you
are. I think I know where you are. Wait,
wait, wait. The frame rate's pretty bad.
I think we have to try.
Okay. Oh, nice. Let's take a picture
here. Okay. Are you ready? Smile. Yay.
Oh, yo, that's sick. I like your pose,
Meeks. On the right Joy Con 2
controller, there's an additional
button. With the C button, you can pull
up a chat menu.
Oh, dang. A really, actually, guys, uh,
I got a call coming right now, so uh,
I'll be right back. Yeah. Oh, yeah. For
sure. Here you can quickly and easily
mute yourself and more. And there's
this.
You can also connect this camera to
Hey,
oh my god, I find this so funny. Hi,
how's everyone doing? Good. You can
appear on screen and video chat while
playing a game. here. Can I do streams
exclusively from this feature? No.
Here's how it looks with just the
camera. Why is that so funny?
Oh, but you can do Okay, that's cool.
That's cool. You guys can play the
camera feed like this. Wait. Okay, this
is actually You could put our faces in
the That's pretty cool.
I like that. We can be on other people.
We can have our face cam on other
people's streams for stuff using chat.
That's I actually like that. That's
pretty sick. If I do Mario Party with my
boys, there's a little circle with my
head in it. And the chat can see. That's
That's cool. That's pretty cool.
Chat while playing your personal
favorites. That's pretty sick.
Actually, that's that's enough of a
selling point for me, though. A retro
game competition
or hold a sports competition between
families.
Yo. Okay, I'm on board. Okay. You sold
You sold it to me. I'm a consumer game.
Okay, that's pretty sick. That's pretty
cool. Just don't run like crap. That's
all I care
about. Okay.
Yep. Nintendo.
I'll fine. I'll get one. Fine. Fine.
I'll get
one. They're going to give it to free
for a while,
right?
Yeah. Until Wow. Until March 26. When is
this console coming
out? When the hell is this console
coming out if it's going to be available
till March 26th?
Is it going to be like That's so cute.
Is it going to come out late this
year?
Yes. Wait. So, it's like screen
sharing. Oh, that's neat. I love that.
That is very very cool. Yes, that's
sick. It's like DS download play. It's
like DS download
play. Wow, that's sick. That's really
really
[Music]
cool. Okay, so the game has to be like
pre-coded to be compatible. That's fine.
That makes sense, though.
And you can do it with the old Switch.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Free update 51. Yes. It's one of
the best games, by the
way. The other games won't have input
delay because it's going to send over
the data to the consoles and then
they'll be able to play a local version,
right? Bring back PTO
chat. All right. Here we go. The Switch
2 trailer.
Yes, same thickness. Wow, at 7.9 in,
Switch 2 has a bigger built-in screen.
Here's how that compares to Nintendo
Switch. The console's thickness remains
the same.
Is it 1080p?
With approximately double the pixels
compared to Switch, you can enjoy games
in greater detail on the 1080p screen.
1080p. That's good.
Yes. Oh my god. I guess per second
allowing for smoother gameplay in
supported titles.
120 fps. Are you kidding me?
120 screen is more vivid. And I updated
my entire sound just in case this
happened. Light and dark areas of the
images. Holy.
The allnew Joycon 2 controllers connect
magnetically.
120 FPS controllers firmly attach.
Please tell me Pokemon. Attach your
controller easily. Sorry, I'm getting
ahead of myself. Button on the back.
That's cool. I like that.
The SL and SR buttons are bigger for
greater comfort and control when playing
with a Joy-Con 2 held horizontal. I
don't like the stick how it's a little
bit up holding it that way. But the left
and right sticks are now larger.
And they don't have drift. There's the
mouse. Here it is. People predicted this
controller can be used as a mouse. Play
in compatible games. Both the left and
right Joycon 2.
People predicted this like wow. By
adjusting the audio balance between the
ranges, sounds from the built-in
speakers are clearer and more natural in
handheld and tabletop modes.
Yeah, you saw this game chat obviously.
So you can voice chat with friends
anytime via game chat. It also uses
noiseancelling technology to filter
sounds so your voice will come through
clearly.
3D audio. Even if you don't have a
surround sound system, games can be
enjoyed with more immersive
three-dimensional sound as if it were
coming from all around you. It's pretty
cool.
new stand. Place your Nintendo Switch 2
however you like with a large sturdy
stand. It's going to be great for
travel, man. I'm actually going to play
this thing like this. Damn. Damn. Good
lord.
In addition to the USBC port found on
the bottom of the console, there's one
on top as well. So you can charge it
from the top. Please just charge it from
the top here. For connecting a USBC
camera or ch or charging in tabletop
mode. Thank you. Okay. Thank god you can
charge and play at the same time. That's
something I know that people were like
pretty annoyed about. Nintendo Switch 2
comes with 256 GB of internal storage.
Good lord. that of Nintendo Switch for
your game downloads, save data, and
built in 256 GB is huge. Reading and
writing data is also faster. Okay, readr
speeds are faster. We like to see that.
4K Nintendo Switch 2 doc to connect to
your TV and enable up to 4K resolution
for compatible games. HDR is also
supported in TV mode. Are you [ __ ]
kidding me?
I told you the Leap was going to be
huge. Did I not just say that in the
pre-chair? Has a built-in fan that keeps
your console cool. Dude, I told you this
was going to be hu. I told everybody. No
one believed me. The leap is so big,
man. That's insane.
On Nintendo Switch 2, you can play
Nintendo Switch 2 games as well as
compatible Nintendo. I can't wait. I
told you so, everybody. I swear to God.
Dude, 4K resolution on supported games,
which means 1080p 120 FPS is a breeze.
Easy. Actually, crazy. That's that I'm
I'm very happy with that. I'm very happy
with
that. Yeah, this isn't just this isn't
this is an entirely new thing. That is
sick. Fan in the dark. Yes, sir.
Oh, what's this boy
[Music]
trying? Where?
Oh, what?
[Music]
Oh, so it's like a Okay, it's the
PlayStation 5 thing they did, right?
with
Astro like a tutorial for the
game. Electromagnet.
[Music]
Oh, a bunch of mini games to test out.
This is almost like one, two,
switch, right? Kind of like showing the
power of like the what the what the
controller can do.
It's a paid digital. I don't know if I
would buy this to be honest with you,
but I
[Music]
mean Oh, wait. They're red cartridges.
I kind of like that. But now it's red
and it has much faster reading speeds. I
mean with that amount of
time only work with micro SD express
cards high speed data transfer. Okay.
Okay.
Understood.
SD. That's unfortunate. I was expecting
to be able to reuse those, but I guess
not.
Nintendo system transfer. Okay. Cool.
Cool. Cool. Okay. Yes. I got to get a
bigger SD cuz it's going to be a lot of
money. That's the only thing I'm The
only downside to all this is that it's
going to be
cash. Yo, that looks
like tell me it doesn't have
snapback. Oh, you can map the buttons.
Okay. And they put all Yo, we're in the
future. They finally caught up. people
doing this 10 years
ago. The official Nintendo
Switch, the website will go
live. So, you can listen to game volume
through your controller finally, man.
like
Jesus September June.
Oh my god, that's like two months from
now.
Only three.
Okay, then it's going to say compatible
Switch One games. What's the third one?
What's the third one? What's the third

Nintendo.

Switch to edition
games. Okay. Right. Right. Right, right,
right, right. So, Scarlet and Violet
will get an upgraded version. That's

I'm expecting, chat. Scarlet Violet was
going to run really nicely. Super Mario
Party. Okay, cool. Nintendo Switch.
What's the difference? Show me the
difference. What performance can you do
to to Super Mario Party Jamberee?
Super Mario Party Jamberee is getting an
upgrade on Nintendo Switch 2.
The upgrade expands on the base game and
adds new features, including mouse
controls.
Okay, go audio recognition,
more expressive
rumble and gameplay that uses a camera
accessory. All of which can be accessed
on the Switch 2.
Let's check out three new content city,
man. This is going to be brilliant.
First up is Mario Party mode. With a
single camera, up to four players can
join the festivities. Oh, that's so
funny. Able to see each other's faces as
you play, so you can experience all the
reactions and emotions in real time. Or
four friends can take the party online.
So funny, bro.
Oh, I like that. Up next, it's Bowser
Live, a mode where the livelier team
wins. Bowser will bring you on stage
two. Hit blocks to collect the most
coins.
Guide an RC car with your voice. Go.
And compete in other mini games using
full body movement and sound. Finally,
take a ride on the mouse controlled
carnival coaster. With the safety bar
lowered and secured, you're off. Yoshi's
legs are not covered. I'm just saying.
Use mouse controls to shoot down enemies
while you feel the bumps and rumbles of
the coaster.
Could you play my office? When you enter
a pipe, a miniame will begin. There's a
bouldering game where two players each
control an arm and one where you shake a
can of spray paint and quickly tag
objects. Enjoy the thrill of these
intuitive mini games. How quickly can
you reach the station? from mini games
that use a camera, the built-in
microphone, the the camera in camera
stuff is so funny to me. And Rumble, the
biggest party yet is getting even
bigger. Super Mario Party Jamate
Nintendo Switch 2 Edition plus Jamberee
TV launches on Nintendo Switch 2 July
24th. Oh, okay. So, it got a little bit
of an update. Okay, wait.
Nintendo Switch 2 players who already
own Super Mario Party Jamberee can
upgrade to Nintendo Switch 2 Edition
plus Jamberee TV by purchasing an
upgrade pack. So, you have to pay for
it.
I wonder how much that's going to cost.
Yeah, some of this stuff's pretty
cool. Switch to Edition. Scarlet and
Violet.
Oh, Tears of the Breath of the Wild and
Tears of the Kingdom.
Oh, mate. If these games run at like 60,

No way.
Spongebob, what?
This is Christian Overdam from IO
Interactive.
We are bringing our flagship, Hitman

Spongebob cut scene. And now you'll
murder people. You assassinate them. and
how each mission progresses will vary
depending on the player's imagination.
Our everexpanding game will release on
the same day as Switch 2.
Plus, we are excited to bring another

[Music]
more. Okay. Yeah.
Yeah. How was that, guys?
It just it's it's very funny to me that
like they're showing all this violence
on like the Switch 2 release thing. It
just doesn't feel very Nintendo, but I'm
glad that they're like feeling more
comfortable showing that kind of stuff,
right? Uh it just was a game
collaboration with Nintendo. Wonder when
does that happen? Doesn't happen that
often,
right? They collab with
another when the Zonai who descended
from the
heavens joined hands with the Hilians
who dwelled on the surface. Their union
led to a great and prosperous
kingdom. But in time, a terrible evil
arose.
[Music]
A war was fought to vanquish this evil.
One which future generations would
call the imprisoning war.
Perhaps you truly have traveled back in
time.
You get the plan
out and in the past.
So that's No. Yes. Stop. Then that must
mean this really is cinema. That is
[ __ ]
awesome. Yo. Okay. Yes.
Uh-huh. Oh, wait. It's Wait. Is it

sick. Yep. Yep. Yep. And the fact
they're in the past doing all this that
lead up into the future that Oh my god,
that's so cool. That's That
Yes. That's [ __ ] sick. That is so
sick. That is
sick. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
Very, very, very cool.
The fact that you have to do the all the
stuff that she does in the past that

Hello,
Sephro. Wow. Listen, I listen. We We
have had a an absolute banger here so
far. Here's a I don't really want to get
copyright crumbs. I'm going to just mute
this. But like this Listen, I know I've
hopped on about it a lot, but I'm just
so thankful, so grateful that we finally
have like what feels like an actual home
console. I think they focused too much
on like the portability and they were
using old hardware in the Switch one and
now with the Switch 2, you can see all
these developers coming. They're
flocking to the console to make games
for it because it's it's got so much
more power now. Oh, dude. It's just like
it's it makes me so happy because I I
don't think I realized how long I've
been like rolling my eyes or trying to
see the the you know the the glass hair
full with a bunch of games that they
developed for this console. Even first
party titles like one of the Pokemon
games like we've struggled. Our Pokemon
games have been not great and we only
ever done our best to sort of like look
at them in like a you know with a with
with the cup half full tried to get the
best out of the scenario, make the best
out of a bad scenario and now this
console is actually
sick. It's just it's just it's just so
great to see like finally after like
what is it? It's been it's been like
eight years since we had a uh it's
actually eight. It's from like No, it's
like eight, isn't it? It is like 8 years
since we've had like a decent I mean the
Switch one was great. Don't get me
wrong. I'm not really not trying to hop
on that. But it's just been dragged out
for too long. So, um happy that we have
this coming in just two months, too,
guys. Oh, I'm so excited. I am so so
excited for this console now. And that's
why I love set my expectations for
setting our expectations so low and then
enjoy this fully. Oh man.
