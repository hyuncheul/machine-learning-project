thing makes
sense go I love how the guys

completely forgetting what I was even
doing today new entry in the Mario Kart
series is launching
exclusively switch system welcome to
this vast that's so coolart RAC I saw
Mumu
Meadows GL Mumu Meadows as the cow I

atmosphere will change what a
sophisticated Phantom look at
him is that also oh that's Mario no hat
I wait whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa did
you guys see what I saw
crab you got parab bidy wiggler that
makes sense but the be Monty mole

Spike look at this penguin Spike
navit oh that's insane I cannot believe
what I just saw and drive virtually
everywhere in this world oh I I believe
you in the Grand Prix through foures in
Aid oh wait oh they're showing us so
much
already we just saw like 16 track names
you'll also drive to the next as part of
the comp whoa wait that's actually
really cool oh that's actually really
cool that like they feed in from one
course to the
next oh wait knockout tour oh knock wait
knockout races are one of my favorite
thing about like modded Mario Kart and
that's just like a thing
now okay we got double items back which
is fun there are multiple checkpoints
along the
way wait knockout is awesome actually
you be elimin oh wait that's incredible
you make it all the way to the Finish
Line free roam yo we can wait wait wait
wait this is actually Peak cuz if the we
we have open world Mario Kart right uh
we can play like hide and seek now like
that's the first thing I see is like if
we just have free Ro on and we can play
online uh actually play yeah okay there
you go
drives wait wait thumbnail mode oh my
God wait they're actually giving me
everything I could ask for I can't
believe penguin
though I think seeing so many costumes
kind of makes me think like Metal Mario
Pink gold Mario Tanuki Mario cat Mario I
they're I think they're all
Dead the game Launches on the same day
on the same day I switch to when is that
though more details about this title
will be Shar in up marioart the Mario
Kart World
Direct April 7 oh that's not even far
wait when does the hell does a switch 2
come out
Mario okay I'm going to see if I can
catch up a little bit okay
oh new
joycon we've added a new button oh
that's a different
console let's take a look at some new
experiences it
offers what's the C button do any
guesses oh
alone the C button kills all your family
and friends
oh oh or brings them together
wait is it is it connectivity
button all
together ni I'm coming for
you okay they're having fun though oh
why did I not go to that why did I guess
kill for the SE button
before
chat with this feature you will be able
to communicate with friends and family
while playing a game that makes sense
this is 2006 technology that I'm glad
they're leaning into while they have
Nintendo switch Discord voice is
recognized by a microphone built into
the system okay but you're still behind
me right all right let's keep going okay
it can pick up your speaking voice
clearly even from a distance I'm glad
the switch has not changed all that much
genuinely speaking I am so thrilled that
switch 2 is just kind of switch but
again it switch is such a good console
let's not give it
up it
look and you can use this feature in
handheld mode too letting you easily
chat with friends and family I think the
handheld mode is kind of crazy oh and
you got screen sharing screen sharing
ooh ooh I don't know how I feel yeah you
can already see the frame that's fine
though just like go on top of that
dinosaur really they can do that they
can do it you guys I just did it I want
to do it too oh
shoot I love the acting of they cuz they
have no reference on what they're doing
right
[Applause]
now the frame rate is so
bad but they're being real they're being
honest yeah I know that one it's so hard
right it's tough oh wow I'm like in the
sky right here I'm i f falling I'm fall
okay we got it we're and the audio is
delay I was going to skip forward I feel
like I'm trying to catch up given that I
woke up 4 minutes late this feels like a
great time to catch up a little
bit oh whoa whoa whoa what the switch to
wait we are now entering the age of 2010
technology we got the Xbox connect with
built in green screen feature phenomenal
how could you ever think of such a thing
that people thought of a decade and a
half ago can't wait to see it wait oh
wait wait wait actually okay never mind
we're back we are so back this is brand
new new technology this is kind of
crazy I think I want to play Mario Party
with this camera just once because
that's kind of
hilarious when you're a that's kind of
so
funny why do I even need face cam on my
streams I can just put it in the
game that's
hilarious while person they're like can
you imagine Splatoon a competitive
online team BAS video game with voice
chat can you can you imagine and
everyone's
like yeah we can all together anytime
anywhere game chat game
chat all let me skip forward a little
bit more let's catch up be available on
the same day yeah that makes
sense yeah I'll buy the stupid switch
camera why not
oh on Nintendo switch even if you just
have one we got 52 Clubhouse games now
what's this brand new technology but on
Nintendo switch 2 you can play together
locally on multiple systems using just
one game with game share oh wait that's
kind of sick shown here even games that
require multiple screens can be played
if one person owns a compatible game
with game wait that's actually really
cool that's like one of the most
annoying Parts about the switch look I
have played smash with someone before
where I hold the joycon and then he has
a Pro Controller to play player two
looking over on my screen that's like
the
airplane kind of setup I've done that
before but that's really cool
comp DS download play is so bad free for
clh gam 51 worldwide CLS on Nintendo
switch thank God share support is also
planned for select games exclusive to
Nintendo switch 2 yeah that makes sense
it doesn't have to be on every
game please take a look are we sticking
with switch 2 is that the name whoa oh
we're just getting the
whole the breakdown now here that compar
I think the switch 2 looks really nice
it looks so steam deck inspired but you
know the steam deck is also so switch
inspired approximately double the pixels
compared to switch you can enjoy games
in Greater detail on 1080 actually got
the 1080 games oh wait that's Banger
reveal for that I was like it still
looks a little blurry and then it was so
in the background wait wait wait wait
wait wait wait wait we're moving up to
120 Nintendo's got that many
frames the Nintendo switch one barely
does 60 on doen is viid and support oh
okay that's fine I mean those colors
look great
I've seen inside the joycon 2 that
little chip that has to lock in that
should getting broken as hell system
detach your controller easily by
pressing the release button on the back
I don't know they got to change that I'm
so scared of that
breaking s oh oh it did kind of break or
change that's
Fally that looks so much better
everything looks better like I think the
switch is a phenomenal gamebreaking
generational content and they look like
they're making it even better which is
exactly what you'd want from a like a
console
sequel the mouse Mode's interesting
though it doesn't look comfortable but
it looks uh nice you know what I mean
adjusting the audio balance between the
ranges sounds from the buin speakers are
Nintendo switch EQ how nice are these
speakers yeah we know about the built-in
mic let's see if I can cheat let's see
if I can get ahead a little bit here
don't have aound sound system okay they
got noise cancelling I see you like with
a large sturdy stand okay do you see
that chip on the side I don't know it
it's just
screaming I'm going to get broken to me
addition to the USBC Port found on the
bottom of the system there's one on top
as well yeah it screams I'm going to
break in half for con a us and it's even
worse that it's on the console not the
joy-con you know or charging in tabletop
mode I think just given how the sides of
the switch 2 look it makes me wonder if
we're going to have like so many more
peripherals you can slap on the side of
it g internal
stage that of Nintendo that's nice
though downloads I feel like that's a
honestly not even that needed but I
appreciate it having that much storage
space cuz I have like a terabyte uh
micro SD card on my switch that's super
nice switch to Doc to connect to your TV
and enable I think that looks kind of
clean resolution we're getting built in
Ethernet port thank God HDR is also
supported in TV mode I'm so shocked to
see 4K in my Nintendo console if I can
be so for real this is like a dream come
true it's almost too good to be
true oh my god do you see that do you
see that whole motherboard have you guys
ever actually opened up your dock the
mother board is like this big it is
teeny teeny tiny so the fact that
there's like stronger technology we got
the fact we got a fan at all is
unreal it's
crazy oh oh wait hear me out are they
trying like I thought they locked in
with the switch how deep are we going
okay so it genuinely is switch
to I think good remember when we had the
Wii U incident
grandmothers would go to Target they
would just think the Wii is the Wii and
the Wii U is like a separate thing
switch 2 is so definitive hey buy this
it's new that's what I want to see
genuinely I will the switch two to do
well and that's the way to do it
exclusive to Nintendo switch 2 well
welcome tour is this the Astros playroom
here okay everyone join me inside the
game
okay what what are doing on the side of
the
joyam them what if we kiss on the side
of the
joyon where are the
magets the joyon meet me in the left
joyon area with magnets and those
magnets are inside the system okay cool
the SL and Sr buttons on the joyon 2 are
made of metal that's awesome man so
that's how they attach to the system
okay
thanks a magnetic Circ is this just like
a a museum in the game
okay I'm going to use this
segment to catch up cuz I know I'm going
to miss the big directs oh but we got
mini
golf okay so this is the Astros playroom
of switch
2end how's it taste
though people were freaks in 2017 when
the switch came out everyone was
discussing it but I can't say I can't I
can't help much to say I'm still cu
I'm going to be tasting that switch to
cartridge day
one is it flavored cuz it's red card and
will make we just can't know these
things
yet please note that regular micro SD
cards used for Nintendo switch will not
be compatible oh really additionally to
transfer data oh oh I see what they're
saying yeah yeah yeah that does make
sense can L your Nintendo account okay
transfer data
boring whoa wait side buttons the G and
G
button oh we got so many more oh and a
headphone jack that's kind of nice oh
that's so much nicer plugging into the
controller the off nintend switchs will
go live oh this might be kind of huge
also I haven't said it I haven't called
little bro out but that suit I was
trying to be nice when I keep seeing it
he does not got that [ __ ] on
if I can be so for real oh my God I was
so focused on roasting this guy I
ignored the June 5th that's kind of
close that's pretty close I was focus on
the girl
buttons these games take advantage of
the performance and features of switch
2 the seconde that makes sense that all
these games work Nintendo switch thank
God that they do Nintendo switch 2
Edition games are the third type
some games that were released on switch
will receive upgraded versions that
offer things like improved visuals
unique ways to play on switch and more
like what wait oh oh with the jam TV but
that bottom Bowser thing looks like it's
an entire side mode are we going to see
that I love see oh ooh superio part jere
oh maybe we get some new boards with
this update
too is that too much to ask
for
expands wait I didn't see anything over
there oh right that's new mini
game oh oh wait me
oh oh you rev the engine so we got more
motion controls with the
mouse okay all right I see more mini
games I this is a Mario wait this might
be phenomenal this might actually be the
funniest update ever no no no we are
absolutely playing on this is incredible
is wait no no no no no day one see me
and three Unfortunate Souls playing this
that is so
[Laughter]
funny oh oh no this is so funny online
yeah we're breaking out that switch to
camera I can't believe how well
integrated it a where the team wins
Bower will bring you on stage this
shit's
ridiculous Co this is Xbox Connect this
is Xbox Connect as
hell oh we got the Wonder
flowers Carnival coaster controlled
Carnival coaster with the safety bar
lowered and
SEC you're oh do you see how skinty
peach is did you guys get the same
Glimpse that I did look they just wanted
to show it off look at her wait watch
how low this goes sky
enemies while you feel the bumps and
rumbles of the coaster just in case you
guys are paying attention or
not when you enter a pipe A Min will
begin that's also a new
one amount of new mini games I've seen
obviously this
one uh kind of a
lot the online play looks so much better
but I think that's a I'll believe it
when I see it kind of thing like I think
I got to get my hands on it
before I can really trust in
it I don't know if that m i mean I can
pop out a joycon I don't know if that
Mouse feels comfortable I don't think I
want to do it all that
often
but okay I'm just excited for new mini
games and potentially even an extra
board already superio jam upgade to
nintend this feels like robbery but I'm
just going to view it as paying for deal
UPG pack all right I'm going to look at
I like that please look forward to a new
Mario Party experience can you post the
Mony video oh I had to post the Marian
one yesterday so I'll we'll probably
post the Mony one today
yeah oh oh no way we're getting more
breath of the wild oh and tears of the
Kingdom Nintendo switched two editions
of The Legend of Zelda breath of the
Wild and the Legend of Zelda tears of
the Kingdom wait this game's going to
look beautiful enhanced resolution and
frame rates stable frame rates wait
whoa whoa who whoa okay I actually got
to re explore this entire game now so
you can play with SM higher wa Pokemon
scarlet and violet were the rumors true
does the game actually work
now oh my God could you imagine Pokemon
Scarlet at a stable frame rate genuinely
I cannot but I would love to on
smes oh it's going to be renamed that
makes sense exclusive to the switch
editions of these titles oh that's fun
for example it can help guide you to
various locations like sh where the hell
am I Uber taking me
dude that's actually crazy that you got
voice
guidance or you can share your Creations
using QR Cod oh that's phenomenal though
that's actually really nice for tears of
the Kingdom you can save the schematics
[Music]
oh this kind of huge though we hope
these features will make your Advent
everything is kind of
huge okay and we got Kirby starcross
World new DLC forgot guess you be able
to enjoy okay I I'll be so honest I'm a
sucker for DLC campaigns of games I've
already established that I like so if a
lot of switch 2 launch is games I know I
like Plus DC campaign I'm not against it
especially if this switch 2 version
update is like I'd go up to 20 bucks
right 20 maybe
30 I'm down Metroid Prime Beyond will
have both a Nintendo switch and a
Nintendo yeah this [ __ ] is not coming
out on switch one oh this is a switch 2
game they have to release on switch one
okay after all the 4K and 20 FPS we've
seen why in the hell are you buying this
for switch
one you can explore the imersive world
yeah that's what I'm saying that's what
I'm saying you are not no no no no no no
sir choose from these two modes both of
which support HDR based on your
preference honestly Nintendo leaning
into quality features like this is so
unreal to
me poon Legend oh Legend C8 is also a
switch one game I kind of expected it
not to be I thought they just been lying
to us this whole
time oh stable frame
rate can enjoy your oh you love to see
it genuinely I can't believe my
eyes the Nintendo switch 2 Edition games
you just saw will be available as both
physical and digital interesting
interesting that smash ultimate is not
on that list Fountain of Dreams still
lagging
play the nintend but maybe that's
because we have something else on the
horizon at least ultimate Deluxe I'm I'm
on that ship you know look at that Li
bro got to find a tailor you see this
maybe it's in maybe I don't understand
fashion but dear God whoa whoa whoa whoa
this is a crazy concept for a game who
pitches
[Music]
this drag X
drive out of all game titles for the
switch 2 revealed this was not on my
list anybody else anybody else pitch
this
one uh what if we made 2K physically
laborous H H
thoughts you can
wave huh
yeah this is uh Nintendo Wii levels of
gimmick this is like some shovelware
game that's like yeah you're skiing like
this okay nice okay whoa crazy dunking
though high five oh thank God they have
that in
there if I can be so honest genuinely I
have no idea what to think of this game
genuinely zero thoughts in my brain I
just can't believe what I'm seeing okay
I'm almost close to catching up I have
long observed oh we are going to get so
not
ports yeah ports
though so many games are going to work
Elden ring on switch
2 I believe it honestly if everything is
as they're saying I'll believe it your
this is kind of a crazy direct I
remember on I think the switch one we
also got odsy announcement so can I be a
little greedy can I be a a fat little
greedy baby and ask for a new 3D Mario
is that in the realm of possibility
Elden ring makes total sense to me super
giant from super giant games yeah I mean
Hades
hello I don't talk about it enough on
like my stream and my channel
but Hades 1 is in like a top five
favorite games of all time I adore this
game I have not played Hades 2 cuz I'm
waiting for the full
[Music]
release you can quick Pi up and play
whether you're experienced with the
original or not yeah
Hades later this
year super just super giant just got
that sauce tree fighter
six no way you got the calorie contest
in Street Fighter that's unreal did you
guys see that it was at the top of the
screen we got to fight and oh wait new
amiibo I didn't even think about that as
a
possibility I'm so shocked yeah that's
the first amiibo announcement we've
gotten the whole Direct weapon safety
mechanism confirmed all operating at
normal levels testing data link with
spine normal coming launch all right I'm
sad what do we got long Wars where our
freedom was restricted I forgot amiibo
existed I'm I'm a little shocked still
yeah in oh they got the ff15 [ __ ] where
I think okay it's so rule of cool if you
don't know in Final Fantasy 15 noctis
initi battle he throws his sword at
someone and then teleports to it right
before it hits them look I don't care
what people say about Final Fantasy 15
that [ __ ] is just cool and it gets me
every single time like it's so badass I
won't just stop you I'll is this the
game we catch up on okay we got split
fiction okay wait we're naming games
that are already out that are coming to
switch split fiction is great I think
you can now play that on a plane

skip forward cruise
ship oh oh no that that makes sense okay
I was like look what the hell's a cruise
ship game and why is he
skateboarding oh and we're live okay and

the best soundtracks ever made genuinely
genuine genuinely genuinely if you have
not listened to this soundtrack in full
you will recognize a lot of songs from
my videos but Bravely Default phenomenal
soundtrack it is so
good uh this is a 3DS RPG
Series so does it surprise me that it's
finally coming to console no cuz this is
kind of great
okay earlier I was talking about a man
who does not got that [ __ ] on that man
does you see that suit fitted and style
oh my God it is
phenomenal I think the switch to finally
being this powerful handheld it kind cuz
I love playing RPGs curled up in my bed
and if I can play them all handheld mode
and switch this might be the future of
RPGs for me genuinely speaking I'm
saying genuinely to I'm just just
thrilled we'll have more games to show
from our publishing and development
Partners switch one was kind of the RPG
machine but now have everything looks
good I can play like the big boy RPGs
take a
look is this
Warriors this is Warriors right when the
zai who just from the studios alone
joined hands with the hens who dwell on
the surface their Union led to a great
and prosperous
kingdom is this but in time a terrible
evil cuz oh we already got the the
second hyro Warriors game I guess they
just got to keep making more if it keeps
selling Vanquish this evil one which
future Generations is this DLC is this
switch 2 Edition is this port is this
new game what are we feeling imprisoning
War I guess it's tears of the
Kingdom perhaps you truly have have
traveled back in

is that oh they actually got something
here that was Hy Warriors what the hell

being developed by Co Techo games with
support from Nintendo it looks so good

hilarious Edition here machine
customization and story mode get ready

though look they did make the Battle
Royale mode not too long ago though so I
guess it's not as foreign as I'm acting
like it is enjoy these classic games
with clearer image quality and higher
resolution than the original releases
yeah this is going to be good you can
also check the controls for each title
and customize them to your liking that's
really nice actually yeah I'm super down
for that more titles will be wait Gale
of Darkness Path of Radiance that should
cost a million dollars so thank God and
Coliseum Nintendo GameCube they don't

ambitious Portlands game we've ever made
Borderlands 4 will launch in 2025 we'll
be sharing L of the game in the months

way I think he's speaking in English the
audio is super dein we're releasing a
Nintendo switch 2 edition

and guide your people I'm kind of
surprised if the switch two is really as
strong as they say they are it
is this is kind of the everything
console
suddenly I think we can all agree switch
one generational iconic phenomenal
but just didn't have the power to
compete and it feels like they kind of
do
now and we have even more news from 2K
some said I'm jumping for joy Delta Ru
to Civ six and you've already forgotten
about Borderland for it seems which
is woo 2K yeah we can't wait to see you
in the ring and on the court yeah 2K get
in in the game to say I know kids find
this old tatter okay but what is this
went armed with nothing but youthful
enthusiasm and a profound lack of
preparation four kids stranded this a Mr
Beast
video I know if you're doing like a
survival game you got to start with a
better subtitle than four kids
stranded is it it's not supposed to be
frozen
righte Lord of the Flies ass game yeah
hold up

it's frozen okay it's not just
me

just got to go to the Nintendo
UK YouTube I think I do Nintendo
UK uh okay let me type this
in okay now let me go back to see what
we've missed okay look I feel sorry for
this
game okay yeah four kids stranded on an
island got it survival kids for kids who
get sted on wait bullets and aim for
Theon deps in our Rog likee shooter
sequel now reloaded in a new 3D art
style you can expect some fan favorite
elements to return we're still working
on on the game we're excited has gungeon
2 been announced is this the first time
I'm hearing about it or is it like a
thing cuz I just don't remember the
knowing about
that what is this this like Pikmin but
you're the guys
oh I mean I did kind of tune in this
when I first booted it up it's like Star
something star
something logo comes in now yeah Star
Seeker astroneer
Expeditions I mean it's probably a fun
Co-op game just anything like that is
typically
fun looks like he's from The Mask no no
no or what what's the other movie I'm
thinking of Master of
Disguise
whoa wait that's not a reveal I
expected I live Cloud
Strife show her show her do
it I I don't know I love this game I've
heard mixed things from like all my
other Final Fantasy die hards but
everyone loves this game this oh it's so
good there he
is oh okay we're just going to the run
back
again so
casually we're just throwing that
in we're not even like drawing attention
to it
wait but but
like I know it's not as big as the other
games but I feel like Silk song
genuinely is one of the most anticipated
games of all time and we don't even get
so much as a spoken word about
it okay wait puyo puyo Tetris 2s equally
as exciting for someone like me I love
that but they they just throw silk sock
in there all right [ __ ] all right
silk song comes out this year
confirmed I don't know when but sometime
eventually after June fth I would
guess
okay what is the final announcement of
today uh yeah I don't think we're we
never get Pokemon stuff in a game or in
a direct like this they do their own
thing
normally uh I think it's either three
Mario or smash ultimate Deluxe or
something else I don't know those are my
two
guesses fortnite
yeah oh I switched to Lego fortnite and
I was like the logo got stuck my ass
forgot okay hello Mr Leon to you Plaza
oh they're so
cute I didn't realize they made us or I
guess that they're working on a sequel
this game's hilarious but does it have a
funny little camera mode in
it that's true this has been a game
packed direct thank God we have
subtitles now
though I'm locking in I was going to say
3D Mario I don't think that
anymore yeah they said this is not a
Nintendo game so it makes
sense
yeah yeah it makes sense that they want
a big reveal for Resident Evil
right my
blood but my ass was like
Mario and then it was very much
not I misunderstood what that last guy
said I'd be yapping a little too much
turn a wheel
and transport
him to a night of
moonlight to Humanity's very
dusk Mario Odyssey 2 revengeance okay
let's not count it out yet we've never
seen his hands under those
gloves oh no the not Resident Evil my
bad
wait what
if is this a bloodborne reveal in the
Nintendo switch
direct it look it wasn't on I mean we
got the Elden ring reveal earlier but I
just didn't expect such a thing someone
says this could be Club Penguin 2o yeah
again let's not count it out until we
see a title they could be really
experimenting with the
future this is a pretty pack direct I
saw someone mentioned how much the first
Nintendo switch reveal direct had so my
expectations were actually pretty high
this direct because I think they
announced 3D Mario Xenoblade 2 uh
platoon couple new IP like they had a
lot of new announcements last reveal so
I thought this one had to be big and
personally I felt like Nintendo has kept
their cards close to their chest for
like the past couple years now so I'm
not too surprised that they're out
swinging right now close your eyes and
contemplate now the moon as
toart I pray that you are
able carrier of this is not a game I
expect to get revealed in in such a
manner
I like the TX the T-Rex
mode I've closed my heart to bloodborne
2 I'm never hoping ever
again can I skip ahead and tell you the
answer the dusk bloods oh that's just
a well from soft is going to do it again
and who say they
can't I'm not getting in their
way and rat by the
way available only on Nintendo
switch that's unreal that's not
something I expected Nintendo switch
exclusive that's unreal
okay yeah thank you everyone for showing
us games in
addition our partners are working on so
many games we just the Nintendo switch 2
has
games all
right next take a look at this this is
not even announced to be the final
reveal we still have so much
more uh I I don't even know what I'm
looking for
here I think we're back to first party
though
this could be no that's Kirby we got a
new Kirby game
here I think okay wait let me sit up cuz
this could be a lot of things this I
think this is smash genuinely I think
this is Smash Bros that doesn't look
like a Kirby model that is absolutely
smack uh-oh uhoh all
right all right we coming out of
retirement we'll
see am I putting the Jersey back on only
time will tell oh Air 2 though hold
up this could be a lot of things we
can't say for certain what it is
yet I really believe for a second I was
like that does not look like the Kirby
model but airide
2 not on my bucket look I don't think
gun to my head I ever guess air R too
what do we
[Music]
got Air
Riders that's a crazy
one oh my God he's back he look he's
been talking about the game he's been
wanting to make and he finally got it
wait it's a no no no not smash that okay
well that's why the model looked so
familiar oh my God Sakurai is back in
the saddle for another curve
game he's hyped this game up everyone
was like Sakai working on a new game
it's got to be
smash okay next is our last trailer look
I'm happy for Air Riders but I can't
even focus on that we got something new
I'm guessing 3D Mario that's my
guess o this could
be this could be a funky little Mario
game I don't know though I feel like
it's got to be though
it doesn't look like
Mario
but it does look like banjo but I'm just
thinking like no the final Nintendo
Direct reveal is not going to be
banjo wa Donkey
Kong all right no it does make
sense oh he is Aura farming right now so
this is what Donkey Kong looks like now
the rare Donkey Kong is dead this is old
Donkey Kong again we got DK Odyssey
here wait this game actually might be
Peak I'm seeing the movement
already oh wait this actually could be
great andan the fact you can like
terraform everything around
you genuinely was the last time we got a
three dunk Donkey Kong was it really
Donkey Kong
64 like the destructible environment
looks
incredible wait no hasn't this game been
rumored for so long actually I forgot
it's been a while oh we got the 2D
sections too that's fun yeah I forgot
this got uh so teased back in the
day oh banana
I forgot no this is not a total surprise
but it was for
me this game genuinely looks phenomenal
though that's the craziest part I like
that Donkey Kong's got overalls now why
not it's such an unnecessary design
feature but I'm fine with it Donkey Kong
Bonanza
all right pretty good title I give it up
I like the new Donkey Kong he's growing
on
me in July too yeah I'll play
that dony
[Laughter]
kongu I see consistent frame rate I see
good-looking game like Nintendo switch 2
or Nintendo switch 1 I was compromising
with that
constantly but I'm happy I'm happy with
everything I saw I really did think it
was smash for a second with the Air
Riders but I never know if Nintendo's
truly done I feel like we got and one
more
thing I don't know do we got in one more
or have I like gas lit
myself we got the camera we know that oh
and Mario Kart World
that's pretty high I think Mario Kart is
such a good launch title like with any
Nintendo console it's always the correct
move Mario Kart world is going to sell
like hot
cakes I also like that Nintendo is
really done with numbered entries I feel
they love their subtitles
now I mean day one see me playing Mario
Kart World in Delta Room chapter 3
okay okay we are done I kind of had the
feeling that they were going to throw
one more and but one more at us but no
we're done done we're done done I think
I'm seeing credits and I'm like
maybe maybe wait hold there's a post
credit scene no I'm just kidding um yeah
all in all I'm G to buy
everything what was the price it's
probably like 400 bucks is my
guess um that was fun I'm glad I woke up
at 6:00 a.m. for that genuinely
genuinely like that had a lot of stuff
that I was excited for and now you guys
want to play the game Nintendo doesn't
know about
