Hey everyone, welcome back to Switchtop.
Today we're looking at the top 25
mustplay arcade games on Nintendo Switch
in 2025. These games bring that classic
arcade feel right to your Switch,
whether you're playing on the TV or on
the go. Let's jump right in with our
countdown. Mushi Sama is an amazing
shoot them up game where you control a
young princess riding a giant beetle
through forests filled with huge
insects. The game is all about dodging
hundreds of colorful bullets coming at
you while shooting back at enemy bugs.
You can choose different attack types
that change how your shots work and pick
up power-ups to get stronger. What makes
this game special is the bullet hell
style. The screen gets filled with
beautiful patterns of bullets that look
impossible to avoid, but there's always
a safe path through. The game has
different difficulty modes so new
players can enjoy it, too. The Switch
version runs perfectly and includes all
the extra modes from the arcade, plus
practice options. If you've never tried

Andro Dunos 2 is a sidescrolling space
shooter that came out 30 years after the
original game. You pilot a spaceship
flying through alien worlds, fighting
off enemy ships, and huge bosses. What
makes this game stand out is the weapon
system. You have four different weapon
types you can switch between any time,
and each one can be upgraded separately.
There's a spreadshot for groups of
enemies, a laser for strong single
targets, missiles for extra damage, and
a special weapon for tight spots. The
game feels fast and smooth with colorful
stages that each have their own look and
challenges. The story is simple. Aliens
are attacking, and you need to save the
day, but the focus is on the action.
With multiple difficulty levels and a
practice mode, it's great for both new
players and shoot them up experts. The
Switch version plays perfectly in both
handheld and TV
mode. Sega Ages Out Run brings the
classic driving game to Switch with big
improvements. This isn't a regular
racing game where you compete against
others. Instead, you're driving a red
Ferrari convertible through beautiful
scenery against the clock. You need to
reach checkpoints before time runs out,
choosing your route at forks in the
road. Each path offers different
challenges like sharp turns, hills, or
traffic. The game captures that feeling
of a summer drive along the coast with
your hair blowing in the wind and catchy
music playing. This Switch version adds
new features like gyro steering. You can
tilt your switch to steer, a new music
track, and different Ferrari colors to
choose from. There's also a rewind
feature that lets you try again after
crashes without starting over. The game
runs at a smooth 60 frames per second
and looks better than ever while keeping
that classic arcade feel.

Blazing Chrome brings back the runand
gun action of games like Contra and
Metal Slug. In a world taken over by

rebel, or Doyle, a reprogrammed robot
fighting to save humanity. You run,
jump, and shoot your way through six
tough levels filled with robot enemies
and huge bosses. The game gives you four
weapons to switch between. A regular
machine gun, a grenade launcher, a laser
that bounces off walls, and an electric
whip that hits enemies all around you.
You can also find power-ups like a
shield or a speed boost. What makes this
game special is the ability to call in
vehicles like motorcycles and mechs in
certain levels, changing how you play.
The pixel art looks amazing with
detailed backgrounds and smooth
animations, and the synth rock
soundtrack perfectly matches the action.
With local co-op for two players and
multiple difficulty settings, it's a
blast. Whether you're new to these types
of games or a veteran,
