[Unknown Speaker]
-Hello there! Boop.
The game you’re about to see... boop...
doesn’t have a big,
epic story... boop...
but what it does have
is lots of funny little rhythm games!
Boop.
You wanna see? Boop.
Just press the button
to jump through the ring. Boop.
It sounds easy...
but the timing is super tricky.
Boop.
Maybe you could try it
in time to a rhythm?
[rhythmic electronic music]
[characters vocalize as they jump]
In this game,
you might do almost anything,

[Nintendo Switch Snap]
[upbeat lounge music]
-With game cards,
you can put a game featuring Mario
in this Nintendo Switch system,
and a Legend of Zelda game
in this one...
freely inserting the games you have on hand
into any system you want.
But, what if digital games
could be as flexible
and convenient as game cards?
Well, here's what we came up with!
[music fades]
[lively big band music]
Introducing the virtual game card.
In the future, virtual game cards
can be used for digital games.
[music fades]
[relaxing orchestral music]
When purchasing the
digital version of a game,
it will be loaded onto your system
as a virtual game card,
allowing you to play that title.
Your digital games
will be lined up as virtual game cards,
on a dedicated management screen.
Here, you can load
and eject your virtual game cards
and manage which games
you can play on your system.
[groovy jazz music]
If you have two Nintendo Switch systems,
you can eject a virtual game card from one,
and load it onto the second.
Now you can play this game
on the second system wherever
and whenever you want,
just as if you had
inserted a physical game card.
With virtual game cards, you can
freely load and arrange which games
you play on up to two systems.
Local communication
with your second system is required,
but only the first time.
[music fades]
[snazzy orchestral music]
You can also lend out virtual game cards
to your Nintendo Account
family group members!
Connect to your family group member's system
via local wireless
when you want to lend a game.
Choose the title you’re lending,
and who you’re lending it to...
and you're done!
They can now play on their own system.
You can only lend one game at a time
to a particular person.
Games can be lent out for two weeks,
after which they will
automatically return to you.
Making digital games even easier to use.
Virtual game card.
[music fades]
[cheery synth music returns]
-The virtual game card feature
lets you swap games
between Nintendo Switch systems,
as well as to Nintendo Switch 2 systems.
