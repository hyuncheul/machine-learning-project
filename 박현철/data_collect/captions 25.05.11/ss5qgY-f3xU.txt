Nico needs to get it to a certain place.
I see. But, uh,

time.
Well, no time to think because the Indie
Cross is

course, see Shantae as well because
technically Shant
looks lip syncing.
Thank you, Zack. Thank you, Zack. Yes,
Zack. Thank you, Zack. Attacked my go.
This was malicious. Well, you certainly
got the wrong one. It didn't attack us
when we met. It only acts in
self-defense. Self-defense. It barely
moves. Ghost. Yeah, that's what I want
to call them. think of a threat at this
point even if it wanted to. So it does
want to
no. How can we be certain in our quest
to return home? Can't miss.
Devil's got a point. Dolph face. So beat
it. Look, please just trust me. Okay. I
assume you're both not from around here
either, but this robot seems to know
something. And it could be our only way
back home. We mean no harm, but we
cannot take that risk. Step aside and
he'll handle this. What?
What the [ __ ] Okay. Should do that.
Yeah, he has he has he has the phase
locket. I see. Oh, hit him with this. I
think we know who wins this one. I think
we know I think we know who wins this
one. Who wins this one? Literally, one
of them can't fight. Oh, hold on. Do not
hurt the young lady. Divert your focus.
Hold on now. I know you're
hell no. I I like how you charge like
the the window of the skills. Yeah, I
know. He charged the nail
art. He was going to go crazy.
I was think off it. Oh, this guy, dude.
I mean, there's no double bosses in
Hollow Knight. He doesn't know what to
do. There's only one. There's only like
one double boss in Hollow Knight. He's
not ready for this. Help him.
You're not ready for this, my boy. Oh, I
love this. Oh, wait. That's so cool. Oh,
wait. I love that. That's so That's so
awesome.
Dude,
little help here. You're missing. Come
on.
I knew it.
Damn. I knew it. A good thing it's pink.
Yeah, good thing it's pink. What's
going
to Okay.
Oh, hey. Hey. Hey.
Time to go. Oh, double dash. Okay. When
did you get that? Uh, battling. She's
Oh, yeah.
I was the night got cooked and not
showing up again. Yeah. Yeah.
Damn. Oh, never mind. The subtitles. Oh,
man. Oh, damn. [ __ ] Oh, clean with it
though. Oh, dude. Okay. The goal is
right.
They jump at him. They jump at me. They
jump over the void.
Oh,
dude. Dude, face lock it. Hey now. Hey
now. Down,
dude.
The
nail honor of the code. I won't abandon
a friend. Shouldertosh shoulder, we face
our destiny. Let's all take a breather
for a second. Okay. I understand our
encounter was less than pleasant, but I
think the little robot can clarify
everything now that it's active again.
Right. The crouch.
Um, function is to assist in
facilitating your return home. I think
you're lying, but cooperation is
necessary. Look, pal. I can call a
scheme from a mile away and come in a
few myself. Yeah. Okay. Care to admit?
Explain your motives clearly. It's
saying we need to work together. Using
our skills to get back home. We need to
use our specific game mechanics to get
home. Gizmo to make our way back. If it
leads us home, then it is a path worth
considering. But know this machine.
Machine.
You know, there's another indie game
that hasn't been on here yet.
I'm
holding up already.
Great. All right, calm down here. And
more importantly, how do we return to
our home? And what's the deal with these
crimson stars tossing us all over the
place? Don't get me wrong, I'd never say
no to an adventure, but I think I've
seen enough. Enough. No [ __ ] way.
There's two. Charles, what? What do we
Hello.
Hey,
dude. Oh god, there is there. Wait,
there is ultra kill. I know you're dead.
Wait, who the [ __ ] are you? Uh, copad.
I guarantee you they goti. They
genuinely
guarant anyway. Yeah, I mean I think bro
likes voicing Gabriel and whatever. If a
portal fails to form near an anomaly, it
could cause their shrimp special.
Sh5 shrimp specials.
The devil. The devil. The devil reality
will be beyond the devil. Oh yeah, sure.
Oh yeah, sir. Anyway, the occurrence of
the portal is always random. The only
way to be certain of your destination is
to directly consume it power, which is
usually impossible for one to control.
One must meet certain
requirements at the moment.
Where our little cooperation comes in. I
need you lot to help me hunt down the
rogues so I can extract their energy.
That seems suspicious. By now, who knows
how much they've gathered. Only one of
them should suffice to get you all back
home. Who are these rogues you speak of?
They are Henry Stigman. Robots that want
to take over the world. Take over the
world. You're evil. Guys are evil. But
yeah, we'll run them eventually. Can't
you just open another one? We saw you do
it before you went all
Okay.
of my energy to eliminate that child. To
eliminate that child. What?
Fast Frights. You sent the child to fast
Frights.
You sent Frisk to fast
in case you didn't know who that was. In
case you didn't know who that was. Hey,
at least you have that though. Yeah, I
think they can just do that.
Yeah,
I always come I always come back. I
always come back. Wait, he's a child.
You're cooked.
Not that child. No, I I don't think so.
This is first. Come on. You mean
Yeah. Aton isn't ready, bro. He's not
ready.
He knows that a child.
I haven't seen one of those. I haven't
seen a kid since I love kids. I haven't
seen a kid since. Thanks, Super Spring
Trap. In case you didn't know, it's me.
It's me.
to join us for a little game.
Are you just going to stand there or
what? What the [ __ ]
I I'm not playing these games. What the
hell was that? I
Hi.
[Laughter]
It's Oh, no. I do for this. Hey, look.
No need to be hasty. We can talk this
out.
Are you kidding me?
What? What? What is that? Charm
resources.
I can help you get it.
Get the letter.
Pretending to gather info. Pretending to
gather info. The mentioned knight serves
as a chosen vessel faded to imprison the
radiance, thereby safeguarding their
kingdom from the insidious threat of
infection. We're going to get the
[ __ ] you going to get the basic
ending. Come on now. You mean that
thing? What's that thing? It seems our
destinies are intertwined in ways we
hadn't fathomemed. I like how someone
like like sits from like 2D to like 3D.
He saying Yeah, he did. Oh [ __ ] it's
Unity. Oh [ __ ] it's Unity.
Oh [ __ ] My worst nightmare. No, they're
going to take all your money.
Give me my [ __ ]
And do that apparently. This is the
power of the Unity game engine. This is
the power of the party. Each time we
each time someone does a game, you owe
me a dollar.
They should not be capable of lending
such a blow from a bow. It's a bow and
arrow.
My money. Get your money.
My money,
brother. I can't blow from the distance.
Rude.
You lost. You died. You unidor. Untor.
Okay.
Uh-oh. Guy [ __ ] sucks at Cuphead.
This guy [ __ ] sucks at Cuphead. Damn
it. Frustration aside, let's turn this
to our advantage. This realm is about to
be smelted. Millions of portals will
start appearing and if we're lucky,
we'll be able to catch one before we So,
anyone get Cuphead? I think he's like
dead. Have one shot at this. Oh, yeah.
No. Can we get him again? He's dead. Get
over it. He's dead. Get over it. Not an
option. Then what do you suppose we do?
Fly up and slap him into conscious.
Correct.
So quick with it. I will slap him into
conscious.
Well, yes, actually.
Well, yes,
actually.
That's usually how it works, too. Oh,
feather time to go. Hey,
like Yeah, that's usually how it works.
You slapped him in the slice. Yep.
Yes. Wow.
Only had one shot at this, huh?
There's only one shot at this.
Ah,
with people from DMC 3. Holy [ __ ] My
favorite indie game from TMC 3.
Of course.
Ah. Ah. Oh. Oh. Okay. That was a little
overkill. I mean, I get it. It's unity,
but come on then. Kill. Come on. It's
It's Unity.
Yeah. Kill.
Okay. What was Ultra?
Kill. If it was Ultra. That kill was
Ultra.
Where the hell are we? Oh, hey.
Hyperledger.
Hey, it's Clar. It's Claren. It's
Claren.
Oh my god. His rivals going to be one of
these. That would be really funny. Very
awesome.
Did you get that?
I wish I finished fish this game, but I
I need to play this game. Looks cool.
It's pretty cool.
Oh, I see where the fighting No, no, no.
Se Hyper was made in Game Maker. This
game was fighting Unity. I see. Of
course. Of course. It looks like
a Damn.
Schizophrenia. This is schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia.
Yeah, I think he does. Can I do
this? Um.
Uhoh. Um. Hey, peasant. Oh no. Oh my
[ __ ] god. No
way. That's us guy. Wake up. Look, I am
not above letting you die if that
happens again. Got it.
Also, how does this thing turn on? Does
it have
Good [ __ ] job, idiot. Good idiot. Get
your body back, bro. It's a good thing
you're [ __ ] Dead Cells guy. It's a
good thing. It's a good thing you're
Dead Cells guy.
Is that his name? Yeah, I think so. At
least let me. It's also funny because
Dead Cells canonically
collabed with Hyperlight Drifter and
Hollow
Knight some other indie games. Uh,
wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I have a That's the final boss. The
judgment.
Wow. Spoilers.
Explains why you black out every two.
You got two more of those.
I I need to play dead again. Me, too.
Actually, I don't know if I I played a
bit recently. Looking for one of these
all day. Got to move. See you peasant
with a terminal. See a peasant with a
disease. Your days. See you peasant with
a terminal disease. What about this guy?
Where are they? The portal game master.
Game master. Okay. All right. You think
you're [ __ ] funny. Come on, peasant.
Let's kick his ass. Wait. No, but that's
your game. Hyperlift. No. Drifter. No.
Yeah. Who cares? That's your engine.
Well, that's useless now.
Back to Freddy Fazbear. Oh, what the
[ __ ]
Spru Chunk's going to get machine.
Imagine Michael like pulling up and it's
just like, "Oh, cuz he's dead."
Uh, hold
on. The children that killed reference.
Oh [ __ ] You got the
install. [ __ ]
I I feel like someone with the install
first would not care. I can see feel
everything. This is beyond anything I
could have imagined. You brought up
quite Oh, that thing that I actually
don't know what that is. Stupid. Well,
no. I I I don't even know what they
armor like. That's the strongest armor
for him in the game. Oh. Oh. Oh god.
He's showing all all the animatronics.
Her I guess.
So I think these guys,
dude, we go back. Please go back. I need
to see how they kick the [ __ ] out of
Foxy.
Hey, didn't tumble it. Damn. I hate the
fact that everyone else killed. Yeah.
Yeah. I love that because of course mean
arenas the cupcake. Come on.
Oh, that thing. That thing. But you
should know that. You should know that
exist yet. You should know they
whatever. Music man. Music man. I guess
he did say he could see everything. So
music
man circus maybe keeping
up. Oh.
Okay. Monty, what the All right. Okay,
bro. We're okay. Okay.
That always works. It always works. A
conveniently
shar is that just a
marionette. This is the actual puppet.
You want this?
Oh my head.
You'd be cracked right now. Well, this
place is certainly less depressing.
Where are we? One of the many realms
destined to live in the one we have just
now you have to turn up. Mine darling,
listen. You're going to get yourself
killed. You know that. What? Why? What
do you mean why? That idiot. Oh, don't
hate. And now you're volunteering to
help fight a bunch of weird looking
robots that can kill us in the blink of
an eye. This is out.
This is too much for you and you know
it. Maybe it is. But I did prove you
wrong before. You climbed a mountain.
You climbed a mountain. For most people,
that's a huge achievement.
But for these guys, easy riches. Easy
riches. Easy riches.
Dog, it's not worth it. Oh, bro.
Brother. Oh, of course. Cut's consoling
him. He would know. God damn it. He
would know. He would know. Don't make a
deal with the devil. Oh, terrible charm.
That shouldn't apply here. But hey, and
by the looks of it, this is the use I
guess. We'll get to spend more time
together again now that you're here. It
puts like a shield orbits a shield
around you. Wonder what's up with It's
kind of I mean it's probably it's kind
of weird. Could be your new goto instead
of the shovel. Oh, right. The knight
kind of broken.
Batman. No, wait. Batman.
Dead. Sorry, young Batman. This land
could never replace it. S yourself. I
reckon I can send those mechanical to
the thing. Also, is that a duck? No.
You got to be [ __ ] kidding me. Are
you [ __ ] stupid?
A sign of good fortune on our quest.
That's a That That is
a legs aren't working. Let us halt our
journey. My legs aren't working. We
could use some rest. Oh my god.
Screwies. No way. You're right. I think.
Mhm. Hey.
Yeah. Oh, did I? I missed it. Now's not
the moment to be picky.
Like where's Guys, looks like we have
one shot. How's that? Shut up.
Holy [ __ ] Death threats. Death threats.
He doesn't He doesn't even do that. He
doesn't do that, but I feel like he
could. I didn't mean to startle you.
Sorry. It's no trouble. What? What are
you hiding from? What are you hiding
from? There's a bunch of these scary
robots fighting a person in a hooded
cloak. One of them saw me and tried to
attack me. Hey, [ __ ] I was saved at
the last second. I was Yeah. Yeah.
Stay back.
Stay back, bro. You're not built for
this. You're not built for this. Know
he's still around. Well, taking down one
of them is no simple task. So, if he's
battling many, I doubt he'll go down
easy. I'm confident he'll return safely.
So when I feel like you send them up,
it's dangerous out there, dude. [ __ ]
3D ass.
Oh, didn't know that. Yeah. So basically
the player character is considered
golden nut wall. Yeah, I know about
that. Also, look at that light bulb.
Won't that thing blind you if you keep
holding right next to your face like
that? I believe a cat's eyes would react
differently when exposed to such bright
light. I am not a cat.
Hold on. I didn't see that. What read?
Huh? By by the gods of
golden
nightm curses helm that blinds me that
is foolish heart that leads to the
conclusions. I have a disgrace to the
order. No, the nighthood itself. You
can't be that serious. You can't be that
serious. A person. A person. A person
looks like a cat to be the son that
saved the decaying world. He likes
pancakes. At least it was. I was just
about to do it, but suddenly found
myself here. What happens if it breaks?
That would mean the end of the world I
was trying to save. Oh, that would mean
we have one
shot. Fair enough.
Hey, wait.
Honestly, I might need to break that. I
might need to I might need to cop that.
What? Be so for real. All right. Tech.
Two goats fighting together. Two goats
fighting,
dude. All I want Drifter beheaded and
knight fighting together. That'd be so
crazy. Crazy.
That's crazy.

We'll never see him again.
That's the last time you ever see him.
I sure did. Molly
sure. Mind is futile.
Oh, it goes empty. Uhoh.
Look into my eyes. Look into my eyes. My
eyes.
What do you see? The future. What do you
see?
The game. That's pretty cool. Yeah. Oh,
yeah.
What's

the entire game.
It probably is. I don't know. But
whatever.
You showing of the
future. This This is how your game ends.
[Music]
Gasp.
What' you see? Hey, buddy. Hey, look.
Thanks for taking care of my me. Bye.
Hey, I recognize that.
Get real. What the [ __ ] Nap's over.

I kind of like how beheaded is just
Deadpool, which actually kind of makes
sense for him.
Yeah, dude. He's kind of going through a
crisis. He kind of realized he's going
to die. Hey, that's the weapon. That's
my weapon. No way.
Huh? Huh? Hey, the shield. Pick that

Bunch of weeping angels. It's a bunch of
[ __ ] angels. You're cooked. The path

Mars. There might be another way around.
Do you see that small on the floor? Do
you hear us? Have you heard of Among Us?
Oh, wait. You know they're ND2, you
know. Oh, [ __ ]
That was a reference. We already got

remember waiting for that recharge. An
hour, bro. How it took a full hour.
Hey, quest.
Hey. Wow.
This is still fun. This is the finesse,
by the way. You don't want to eat tower
Heaven. That'd be awesome. Yeah.
Music, man. But it's the tiny guy, isn't

Oh. Oh yeah. This guy. Hey

You must be thinking of something else.
No. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, I want
What? Pancakes looking nice.
I would like to have pancakes as well.
Does he even sell pancakes?
250 each. 250.
With what money?
That's one coin. Coin ain't enough. I
think I can pay for that. Also, it's
very price. The [ __ ] out of him. Russian
some kind of circus invitation.
I've got some geog.
Yo, he's loaded on scrap metal. Damn. I
mean, isn't Shai just pays him?
Certainly. I No,
you receive a discount.
Little fine, [ __ ]
I mean, what happened here, by the way?
Why is every wooden in stone? Subspace.
Yeah, sub trophies. Oh, wow. I would
too. I mean, you do really dumb
question. I absolutely tell my golden
friend. Use a shovel as a weapon. Not a
dumb question at all. Yes, I wield a
trusty shovel in battle. It's great for
yet. He has so much crazy though. It's
been through some fights in half.
My
that's But I reckon you should hold on
to it. I am not worthy of such a piece.
Keep it [ __ ] like we
M's going around for basic fix up
materials. We can try to get that shovel
in better shape. Much obliged, Nico. Ah,
RPG makes the logic.
True. There
must give me a shout if you come up with
some better script. Holy [ __ ] Hey, why
is it so heavy? What's the deal with
that ghost?
Thanks for the save, by the way. Oh,
she's uh a part of me. Strawberries.
You could say she is you, huh? You know,
I'm okay. Hold on. The pancakes are
gone. What? Where? Where did the
pancakes go? Wait, how the [ __ ] doesn't
get
plate is clean? You fat [ __ ] Wait a
minute. So, what happened? Unless you're
a ghost, then you can bring Where the
plate go? Where the Okay,
is Maline taking the Just like my other
or someone's plate's gone. Wait, the
plate's gone. Yeah, run that whole thing
back. Okay, run that whole thing back,
please. My whole thing. I get my
pragmatic talk about her persona. My
pragmatic side. There's a whole stack
there. Throw a lot together. I
guess thereinte
unless you're a ghost. Hey,
I hope I hope the next shot I wish the
next shot a table was a gun.
Hey, he mentioned jealous. Come on.
Well, wouldn't it be better than calling
you a robot? I am not a robot. I am not.
That's the point. That's precisely the
point.
Whatever. Say machine. How do we repair
machine?
The simplest method to defeat I like how
like subtitles were being as we went
back to
them to be a serious threat.
The simplest method to defeat them is
to why someone prevents that portal
energy from taking over. Failure to cool
down in time allows that energy to seep
in. While this works in our favor, it
does make their attacks far more
unpredictable and on a much larger
scale.
Damn warranty. It should reveal visible
glowing fractures. Here's a
demonstration. Here's demonstration. You
strike here. I recognize that theme.
Okay. Your cue to go all out before it
heals.
That's all you need to know. Now, leave
me alone. Leave me alone.
Holding his [ __ ] head.
You can do that.
Oh, yeah. That No way. What are you
going to his privacy? The [ __ ] dream
now. Why did you do him for Knight, you
must remain, bro. Really wanted to see
what he's thinking about. Yeah, dude.
Not cool. Not cool. Alone to endure. Not
cool. Not cool, man. Remain unburdened
by your sorrow. Not cool, man. Damn,
though. Damn. Still moping over your
shovel. Uh, yes. Yes, indeed. Yes.
[Music]
For it is a very cherished weapon, you
see. Yeah, me cell. Well, Nico over
there seems to be on to something.
Kind of. Game of darts. You in? Let's
call it a rematch. Your challenge is
accepted. Yes. Yes, of course.
Check my shovel. It's perfect. Check out
my perfect perfect shovel.
All right, [ __ ] Damn.
I see him, bro. What do you Wait, you do
archery stuff. Yeah, it's the [ __ ]
I was like, what the [ __ ] I see.
It's a Honda Sure. No.
Black. Oh god. Oh, no way, bro.
Why? Why did you just do this? Is the
kid stupid? Wait, is the kid stupid,
dude? Why?
There's no way you're letting him. You
You're no way you're letting me do this.
There's no way. Wow. Bro's like, "A
[ __ ] It's going to [ __ ] suck a
chest."
Sucks a chest. Try this guy. Is it
Monty? Uhoh. Good [ __ ] job. Circus.
That is canonical. That is canonical.
Oh yeah. Knife. Oh god. That's just a
regular human. She just cooked. Yeah.
Um what? With the the barb. What the
[ __ ] happened? We could have a little
trouble. What are we doing here? Going
on fire. What's going dude? Frisk is
cooking. Okay, guys. Hold on. What?
