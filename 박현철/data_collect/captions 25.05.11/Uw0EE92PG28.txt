Hey Switch fans, welcome back to
Switchtop. Today I'm counting down the
top 25 single player games you need to
play on your Nintendo Switch in 2025.
These games offer amazing solo
adventures that will keep you hooked for
hours. Let's jump right in.
Momit Farewell is a stunningly animated
2D action platformer and the grand
finale to the beloved Momodora series.
Players take on the role of Momo Reol, a
brave high priestess tasked with saving
her village from a demonic invasion
sparked by a mysterious bell ringer. Set
5 years after the events of Modora 3,
the game weaves a rich narrative filled
with lore, charm, and danger. It
combines fast-paced melee combat, ranged
magic attacks, and a customizable sigil
system that allows players to tailor
their abilities. The game's gorgeous
pixel art and smooth animations are
matched by a hauntingly beautiful
soundtrack that heightens its emotional
weight. With fluid controls, tough but
fair bosses, and freely adjustable
difficulty, it welcomes both series
veterans and newcomers alike. Whether
you're diving in for the heartfelt story
or the intense action, Moonlight
Farewell delivers a memorable journey
through a beautifully dark world,

Luigi's Mansion 3 puts you in the shoes
of the often scared Luigi as he tries to
save Mario and friends from ghosts in a
haunted hotel. Each floor of the hotel
has a different theme like a medieval
castle, disco dance floor, or pirate
ship, keeping things fresh as you
progress. You use the Poltergus G00, a
special vacuum to catch ghosts by
stunning them with your flashlight and
then sucking them up. The coolest new
feature is Guigi, a gooey clone of Luigi
that can squeeze through pipes and
grates to solve puzzles and reach new
areas. The game feels like solving one
big puzzle as you explore each floor,
find hidden gems, and figure out how to
defeat the unique boss ghosts. The
controls are easy to learn, but give you
lots of ghost catching moves. The game
looks amazing with detailed rooms full
of stuff to interact with, and the
lighting effects create a spooky but fun
atmosphere. Luigi's scared reactions to
everything make the adventure both funny
and charming.

Metroid Prime Remastered brings one of
gaming's greatest adventures to Switch
with stunning updated graphics and
improved controls. You play as Bounty
Hunter Seamus Aron, exploring the
mysterious planet Talon 4 in a
firstperson adventure. Unlike most
firstperson games, Metroid Prime focuses
on exploration and discovery rather than
non-stop action. You'll unlock new
abilities like the morph ball to roll
through tight spaces, the grapple beam
to swing across gaps, and various weapon
upgrades to defeat enemies and open new
paths. The game brilliantly uses a scan
visor that lets you learn about the
world, creatures, and lost civilizations
by scanning objects and enemies. This
creates a sense of being an explorer,
uncovering the planet's secrets and the
story of the Choso race that once lived
there.
Chained Echoes is a role- playinging
game that looks like it's from the
1990s, but plays like a modern
masterpiece. The game takes place in a
world where three nations are locked in
endless war, and you control a group of
unlikely heroes trying to end the
conflict. The combat system uses a
unique overdrive meter that you need to
keep balanced. Push too far and you
enter overheat where you take more
damage, but maintain it in the sweet
spot and your attacks become stronger.
What makes this game special is how it
mixes fantasy elements like magic with
technology like mech suits called sky
armors. These mechs change up gameplay
by letting you fight larger enemies and
travel more quickly. The turn-based
battles stay fresh because each
character has unique abilities that can
combo with others, and enemies require
different strategies to defeat. The
story starts as a simple mission, but
grows into a complex tale about war,
redemption, and the true nature of the
world.

Red Dead Redemption brings the Wild West
to your Switch, letting you play as John
Marston, a former outlaw forced to hunt
down his old gang members. The game is
an openw world adventure where you can
ride horses across a huge map filled
with towns, deserts, mountains, and
forests. You'll use various guns and
shootouts, go hunting for animals, play
poker, and saloons, catch bounties, and
help strangers with problems. The game
uses a simple cover system for gunfights
where you can hide behind objects and
pop out to shoot. Your choices matter,
too. You can be good by helping people
or bad by robbing them, which changes
how the world treats you. The story
follows Jon as he tries to protect his
family by doing jobs for the government
that forced him back into his old life.

well, keeping the heart and soul of this
classic western tale intact.

A Short Hike is a small but wonderful
game about a bird named Claire trying to
reach the top of a mountain to get cell
phone reception for an important call.
Don't let its simple look fool you. This
game packs so much charm into its short
play time. You explore Hawk Peak
Provincial Park from a cute overhead
view, gliding, climbing, and running
through forests, beaches, and cliffs.
The main gameplay revolves around
collecting golden feathers that increase
how high you can climb before getting
tired. Along the way, you'll meet quirky
characters, find hidden treasures, and
enjoy mini games like beach volleyball
and fishing. The controls feel great.
Flying and gliding give you a wonderful
sense of freedom as you explore the
island at your own pace. There's no
combat or danger, just the joy of
discovery and helping others with their
small problems. The game respects your
time, taking only two to three hours to
finish the main goal, but you'll want to
stick around to find all the secrets.

Metroid Dread brings back bounty hunter
Samus Iran in a 2D adventure filled with
exploration, action, and tense stealth
sections. The game sends Samos to planet
ZDR to investigate a mysterious signal
only to find herself hunted by nearly
indestructible robots called EMMI in
certain zones. The gameplay mixes
classic Metroid exploration where you
get new abilities that let you reach
previously blocked areas with smooth,
fast-paced combat. Sus can slide under
obstacles, grab onto walls, counter
enemy attacks with perfect timing, and
use a growing arsenal of weapons like
missiles and beam attacks. What makes
this game special are the EMI zones,
where getting caught means almost
certain death unless you nail a very
difficult counter move.

Aie and the Will of the Wisps is a
beautiful platforming adventure where
you play as Aie, a small forest spirit
in a world full of danger and wonder.
The game follows Aie searching for a
lost friend in a new land far from home.
The gameplay focuses on fluid movement.
Ori can jump, double jump, dash through
the air, swing on poles, and eventually
learn many more abilities that make
traveling through the world feel
amazing. Combat is more developed than
in the first game with different weapons
like a light sword, bow, and hammer that
you can switch between to fight various
enemies. The game is a Metroid vania,
meaning you'll find new powers that let
you reach areas you couldn't access
before, encouraging exploration of its
gorgeous world. What makes this game
special is its incredible art style and
emotional story told mostly without
words. The music perfectly matches the
beautiful environments from lush forests
to dark caverns and desert wastelands.

Hollow Knight is an epic adventure set
in a kingdom of bugs where you play as
the knight, a small masked warrior with
a nail, sword. The game is a masterclass
in exploration. You'll delve deeper into
the underground ruins of Hallow Nest,
finding new areas, abilities, and
secrets. Combat feels precise and
challenging. You attack with your nail,
can jump and dash to avoid enemies, and
use spells that cost soul energy, which
you gain by hitting enemies. The game
doesn't hold your hand. There's no arrow
pointing where to go next, just an
everexpanding map for you to fill in as
you explore. You'll unlock abilities
like a wall jump, dash, and double jump
that open new paths in previously
visited areas. What makes Hollow Night
special is its atmosphere, the
hauntingly beautiful art style, amazing
soundtrack, and mysterious story that
unfolds through environmental details
and conversations with the strange bugs
you meet.

humanity lives on a mega city ark to
escape a mysterious threat called
Chimeas. What makes this game unique is
that you control two characters at once.
Your officer and a captured Chimera
called a legion that's chained to you.
The combat system is like nothing else.
You directly control your character with
regular attacks while positioning your
legion with the right stick to create
combo opportunities or bind enemies by
circling around them with the chain
connecting you. You'll unlock five
different legions throughout the game,
each with unique abilities both in
combat and for solving puzzles. Between
battles, you'll investigate crime scenes
in police sections where you gather

clues. The story follows your character
and their twin as they uncover secrets
about the Chimeas and their connection
to humanity.

come give me a hand over here.

challenging RPG where you play as a high
school student who gets transported to
Daat, a post-apocalyptic version of
Tokyo filled with demons. The Vengeance
version adds new story content and
quality of life improvements to the
original game. The core gameplay
revolves around collecting demons. You
don't just fight them, you talk to them
and try to convince them to join your
team through conversations where you
need to respond to their questions based
on their personalities. You can then
fuse demons together to create stronger
ones with inherited skills. Combat is
turnbased with a focus on exploiting
enemy weaknesses to gain extra turns,
but enemies can do the same to you. One
wrong move can lead to a quick game
over, making battles tense and
strategic. The story presents moral
choices as you navigate between order,
chaos, and your own path in rebuilding
the world.

set in a world where two nations, Kevy's

opposing sides who along with their
friends become fused together and
discover the dark truth about their
world. The combat happens in real time
where you autoattack while positioning
yourself and activating special arts
with cooldowns. What makes this game

abilities from each other. The Oraoro

out with friends, working part-time
jobs, and building relationships. But
after school, you and your friends
become the phantom thieves, entering the
metaverse to steal the distorted desires
of corrupt adults by exploring dungeons
called palaces. The combat is turn-based
with a focus on exploiting enemy
weaknesses to gain extra turns in what's

dungeon adventures connect. Building
relationships called confidants gives

activities open new dialogue options.
The story tackles serious themes like

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
and its sequel, Tears of the Kingdom,
represent the pinnacle of openw world
adventure games, revolutionizing how we
think about exploration and player
freedom. In both games, you play as Link
in a vast version of Hyrule that you can
explore however you want. If you see a
mountain, you can climb it. If you see a
distant island, you can glide to it.
Breath of the Wild introduced a
physics-based chemistry engine where
fire spreads, metal conducts,
electricity, and objects react
realistically to the world. Tears of the
Kingdom expanded on this with the
Ultraand ability to build contraptions
fused to combine weapons with objects,
ascend to pass through ceilings, and
recall to reverse object movement. Both
games feature shrines, small dungeons
scattered across the world with puzzles
that test your creativity. Combat
requires strategy as weapons break,
forcing you to adapt and experiment
rather than rely on one approach.

beautifully designed levels filled with
secrets. What makes this game special is
how each level has its own unique ideas
that keep surprising you. You might be
riding minecarts one minute and swimming
underwater the next. You can play as
different Kongs with special abilities.
Diddy has a jetpack for longer jumps.
Dixie can spin her hair to float upward,
and Cranky uses his cane like a pogo
stick. The controls feel tight and
responsive, which is important for the
precision jumping the game sometimes
asks for. There are lots of collectibles
to find, including puzzle pieces and the
letters K O N G in each level, giving
you reasons to replay levels.

Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is a
role- playinging adventure where Mario

and cardboard. The story follows Mario's
quest to find seven crystal stars and
open the legendary Thousand-Year Door.

twist. You can make your attack stronger
by timing button presses correctly
during your moves. Each battle takes
place on a theater stage with an
audience that reacts to how well you're
doing. Impress them and they'll throw
helpful items. Bore them and they might
throw trash at you.
Outside of battles, Mario can use
special paper abilities like turning
sideways to slip through cracks, rolling
into a tube to roll across gaps, or
turning into a paper airplane to glide
across large spaces. You'll explore
unique areas like a fighting tournament,
a spooky forest, and a luxury train,
each filled with charming characters and
humor.
