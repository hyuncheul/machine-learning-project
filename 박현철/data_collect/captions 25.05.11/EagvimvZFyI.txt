Hey everyone, welcome back to Switchtop.
Today we're looking at the top 25
turn-based RPGs you absolutely need to
play on your Nintendo Switch in 2025.
These games give you time to think about
your moves and plan your strategy
without rushing. Let's get started with
our countdown. Valkyia Chronicles 4
takes place in a world that looks like
Europe during World War II, but with its
own unique twist. You lead squad E, a
group of soldiers fighting in a big war
between two major powers. What makes
this game special is how it mixes
turn-based strategy with real-time
action. On your turn, you pick a unit
from a map view and then control them
directly in third person to move and
attack. Each character class has
different strengths. Scouts can move
far, shock troopers have strong weapons,
snipers attack from distance, engineers
fix things, and so on. The story follows
Claude Wallace and his childhood friends
as they fight through harsh winter
conditions on dangerous missions. The
game's unique watercolor art style makes
battles look like they're happening in a
moving painting. With perma death for
your soldiers, if you don't rescue them
in time, each decision feels important,
making this a strategy game with real
heart.
There we
go. That's worth a raise, right? I see
they're good.
Mario and Luigi Brotherhip brings back
Nintendo's beloved RPG series after a
long break. The famous plumber brothers
find themselves on a mysterious ship
sailing between strange islands after a
vacation goes wrong. The battle system
is all about timing. Press buttons at
the right moment during attacks to do
more damage. And when defending to avoid
getting hurt, Mario uses the A button
and Luigi uses B, making you control
both brothers at once. The new brother
bond system lets them perform powerful
team attacks based on how well they work
together during the adventure. Outside
of battles, you'll solve puzzles using
Mario and Luigi's unique abilities.
Mario can use his hammer to hit
switches, while Luigi can squeeze
through narrow gaps. The game has the
same funny writing the series is known
for with lots of silly situations and
both brothers having their own
personalities even though they don't
speak real words.

Yeah, Super Mario RPG is a complete
remake of the Senn classic with
beautiful new graphics while keeping the
charm that made the original so loved.
Mario must team up with unlikely allies,
including his enemy Bowser to fix a
magical Star Road broken by a strange
new villain. What makes this game
special is its simple but fun battle
system. It's turnbased, but you can make
your attacks stronger by pressing
buttons with perfect timing. This timed
hit system keeps you engaged in every
battle instead of just selecting options
from menus. The game world is filled
with hidden treasures, fun mini games,
and puzzles to solve. Each character has
special moves that use flower points.
This game's version of magic with flashy
animations that still look amazing in
the remake. The story takes Mario to
places we never see in his normal
adventures with weird and wonderful new
characters to meet.
[Music]
Sea of Stars is a beautiful love letter
to classic RPGs that feels both
nostalgic and modern at the same time.
The story follows two children of the
solstice, Valeri and Zale, who can
harness the powers of the sun and moon
to fight against the creations of an
evil alchemist. The battle system takes
inspiration from classics like Chrono
Trigger, but adds fresh ideas. Combat is
turnbased, but with timed button presses
during attacks and blocks that make
battles interactive and fun. You can
also use combo attacks where your heroes
team up for powerful moves. The game
uses a unique dayight cycle where
shadows and lighting change, affecting
puzzles and revealing secrets in the
world. There's no random battles or
grinding needed. Each fight is
purposefully placed in the world. The
pixel art graphics are stunning with
dynamic lighting that makes the world
feel alive. The music partly composed by
the legendary Yasanori Mitsuda of Chrono
Trigger fame perfectly matches the
adventure.
[Music]
Chained Echo is an indie game that feels
like a lost '9s JRPG classic, but with
modern improvements that fix the
annoying parts of older games. The story
is set in a world where three nations
are stuck in endless war and follows a
group of unlikely heroes who get caught
up in much bigger events than they
expected. The turn-based battle system
stands out with its overdrive meter, a
gauge you need to keep in the sweet spot
by carefully choosing your actions. Stay
in the optimal zone and your team gets
big bonuses. But push too far and you'll
overheat, giving enemies the advantage.
Instead of random encounters, all
enemies are visible on the map, so you
can choose your battles. Characters can
be customized with a flexible class
system using special crystals, and
everyone can pilot their own mech-like
sky armor for different types of fights.
There's no need for grinding levels, and
the game respects your time with fast
travel available early on.
[Applause]
Triangle Strategy combines tactical
turn-based battles with important story
choices that actually change how events
unfold. Set in the continent of Norelia,
three nations fight over limited
resources like salt and iron. You play
as Saranoa Wolffort, a young lord caught
in the middle of growing tensions
between these powers. The battle system
is played on a grid where position
really matters. Attacking enemies from
behind or higher ground gives you big
advantages. Each character has unique
abilities tied to their class. From
archers who can re arrows from a
distance to mages who control the
elements. Between battles, you'll make
huge decisions using the scales of
conviction system, where you must
convince your allies to vote your way
through conversation and the choices
you've made before. These decisions
branch the story in meaningful ways,
leading to multiple endings and
different battles. The beautiful HD 2D
art style mixes pixel characters with 3D
environments and modern lighting
effects.
[Music]
Fire Emblem Engage combines the series
classic turn-based strategy with a
unique system that lets you team up with
heroes from past Fire Emblem games. You
play as a Leair, a divine dragon who
wakes up after 1,000 years of sleep to
find that the evil fell dragon is
returning. The core gameplay happens on
a grid battlefield where you move units
with different classes like swordsmen,
archers, and magic users, each with
their own strengths and weaknesses. The
big new feature is the emblem rings,
which let your characters engage with
legendary heroes from other Fire Emblem
worlds, gaining powerful new abilities
and flashy special attacks. Between
battles, you'll spend time in the
Somniel, your floating home base, where
you can train, bond with allies, and
even work out or play mini games. The
support conversation system returns,
letting you build relationships between
characters that improve their teamwork
in
[Music]
battle. Monster Hunter Stories 2. Wings
of Ruin flips the usual Monster Hunter
formula by making the monsters your
friends instead of your targets. You
play as a writer, a person who forms
bonds with monsters called monsties by
hatching them from eggs. The turn-based
battle system works like rock paper
scissors. Power beats technical,
technical beats speed, and speed beats
power. You need to guess what type of
attack the monster will use next and
counter with the right move. You can
fight alongside your monster and give
them commands. Plus, team up with other
hunters who have their own fighting
styles. The monster collecting aspect is
super fun. You explore monster dens to
find eggs with rarer eggs giving better
stats and abilities. Each monster can be
customized by transferring genes from
one monster to another, letting you
create unique combinations of abilities.
The story follows your character trying
to understand why Rathalos are
disappearing and the mystery behind a
legendary Rathalos that could bring
destruction.
[Music]
Attelier Risa, Ever Darkness and the
Secret Hideout is a cozy RPG about a
girl who learns alchemy and goes on
adventures with her friends. Rya is a
normal farm girl living on a small
island who dreams of excitement. When
she meets a mysterious alchemist, she
discovers she has a talent for mixing
ingredients to create useful items. The
game's battle system is turnbased, but
happens in real time. A bar fills up for
each character, and when it's full, you
can act, but enemies keep moving while
you decide what to do. This creates a
nice balance between giving you time to
think and keeping battles exciting. The
heart of the game is its alchemy system,
where you gather materials from monsters
and the environment, then combine them
using a simple but deep crafting system
that lets you control the quality and
effects of what you make. As you
progress, Risa and her friends build and
improve their secret hideout while
uncovering ancient ruins and the
island's mysteries.

The Legend of Heroes: Trails to Azure
sits at our number one spot because it
delivers one of the most detailed and
lived in worlds in any RPG. This game
continues the story of Lloyd Bannings
and the special support section from
Trails from Zero working as problem
solvers in the citystate of Crossbell.
Caught between two powerful nations, the
turn-based battle system uses a tactical
grid where positioning matters and
characters can work together with link
attacks when placed correctly. Combat
flows smoothly with a system that lets
you move freely before choosing actions
and limit breaks called Scrafts that can
turn the tide of battle. What makes this
game truly special is its incredible
world building. NPCs have their own
stories that change after every major
event, making Crossbell feel like a real
place with real people. The orment
system lets you customize each
character's abilities by slotting in
different quartz, magical stones to
learn new spells, and boost stats.
[Music]
Dragon Quest 3 HD 2D remake brings new
life to a classic RPG that first came
out over 30 years ago. The story follows
a young hero who sets out to defeat the
evil Arch Fiend Baramos and solve the
mystery of what happened to their
father. What makes this game special is
how it takes the original's simple charm
and enhances it with gorgeous HD 2D
graphics. A style that mixes pixel art
characters with beautiful 3D
environments and modern lighting
effects. The battle system is
traditional turn-based combat where you
select commands for your whole party
before each round plays out. The class
system is where the game really shines.
You can recruit and customize party
members with different jobs like
warrior, mage, cleric, merchant, and
more. Characters can even change classes
while keeping some of their learned
abilities, letting you create unique
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
combinations. Tactics: Ogre Reborn is an
enhanced version of one of the greatest
tactical RPGs ever made. Set in the
islands of Valyria, the story follows
Denim Pavll during a civil war where
your choices actually change how the
story unfolds and which battles you'll
fight. This isn't just a game about
combat. It's about the moral choices you
make during wartime. The battle system
takes place on a grid where height,
direction, and positioning really
matter. You control a team of characters
with different classes like knights,
archers, wizards, and many more unique
options. What makes this version special
is all the improvements they've made to
the original game. Battles move faster,
the AI is smarter, and the level system
has been redesigned so your units stay
useful throughout the game. The world
tarot system even lets you go back to
key story moments and make different
choices to see new story paths.
[Music]
Octopath Traveler features eight
different characters, each with their
own unique story that you can start with
any one of them. There's Olberch the
warrior, Cyrus the Scholar, Tresa the
Merchant, Aphilia the cleric, Primrose
the dancer, Alfen the apothecary, Theion
the thief, and Hennit the hunter. Each
character has a special ability they can
use in towns, like Theion stealing items
from people or Primrose's charming NPCs
to follow her. The battle system uses a
boost mechanic where you save up points
to make your attack stronger or hit
multiple times.
Finding enemies weaknesses is key as
breaking their shield stuns them for a
turn.
The stunning HD 2D graphics mix 16bit
style sprites with 3D environments and
modern lighting effects, creating a game
that feels both nostalgic and modern. As
you travel the world of Orstera, you'll
gradually see how these eight stories
connect in subtle ways. The job system
lets you give characters secondary
classes to learn new abilities and
create powerful combinations.
[Music]
What is the logical course of
action? Those flames flame
strong. Bravely Default 2 tells the
story of four heroes, Seth, Gloria,
Elvis, and Adele. As they search for
four elemental crystals to prevent
disaster, what makes this game stand out
is its unique brave and default battle
system. You can default to skip a turn
and save up brave points, then brave to
take up to four actions in a single
turn. This creates interesting choices.
Do you play it safe or risk leaving
yourself defenseless for a powerful
attack? The job system is incredibly
deep with over 20 different jobs to
master. Each character can have a main
job and a subj job, letting you mix and
match abilities for countless
combinations. As you level up jobs, you
learn skills that can be equipped even
when using different jobs. The game
features handdrawn backgrounds that look
like beautiful watercolor paintings,
while character designs have a unique
chibby style. Towns and dungeons have a
storybook quality like exploring
miniature diaramas.
[Music]
Persona 5 Royal follows a group of high
school students who discover they can
enter a mysterious realm called the
metaverse, where they become phantom
thieves who steal the corrupted desires
from adults who are abusing their power.
What makes this game unique is how it
balances two different gameplay styles.
During the day, you live as a normal
student, going to class, answering
questions, hanging out with friends,
working part-time jobs, and building
relationships called confidants that
give you benefits in battle. At night,
you can enter elaborate dungeons called
palaces that are based on how these
corrupt adults see the world around
them. The turn-based combat system
focuses on finding enemy weaknesses to
knock them down and perform powerful
all-out attacks. The one more system
gives you an extra turn when you hit a
weakness, creating satisfying combat
chains. Managing your limited time is
key. Every activity advances the clock,
and you only have certain days to
complete each palace.

Go down.
Fire Emblem. Three houses puts you in
the role of a professor at a military
academy in the land of Fodland, where
you must choose one of three houses to
teach. The Black Eagles, Blue Lions, or
Golden Deer. This choice completely
changes the story as 5 years later, war
breaks out between the nations and your
former students end up on different
sides of the conflict. The game mixes
tactical turn-based battles on a grid
with school life
simulation. During school phases, you
teach students, build relationships, and
explore the monastery.
Your teaching decisions directly impact
how students develop. You choose what
skills they focus on, what classes they
can become, and even recruit students
from other houses. The battle system
features the classic Fire Emblem weapon
triangle, where certain weapons have
advantages over others, combined with
battalion units that provide support
abilities. Divine Pulse allows you to
rewind time a limited number of times to
fix mistakes without restarting entire
battles. The game has incredible replay
value with four different story paths,
each taking about 50 hours to complete.

Was that helpful? Shinmegami Tensei 5
Vengeance is the expanded version of the
apocalyptic RPG where modern-day Tokyo
is destroyed and transformed into a
wasteland called Daat filled with
demons. You play as a high school
student who fuses with a mysterious
being to become the Nobino, a powerful
halfhuman, halfdemon entity. The game's
core mechanic is demon negotiation and
fusion. Instead of just fighting demons,
you can talk to them mid battle, answer
their questions, and convince them to
join your team. Once you have demons,
you can fuse them together to create
stronger ones that inherit skills from
their components. The press turn battle
system rewards you for hitting enemy
weaknesses with extra actions, but
enemies can do the same to you, making
battles strategic and tense. Vengeance
adds a new storyline path, the ability
to save anywhere, and new demons to
collect.
[Music]
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold
Steel 3 continues the epic story of Rian
Schwarzer, now a military academy
instructor leading a new class 7. Set in
the Arabonian Empire, the game balances
school life with increasingly tense
political situations that threaten to
erupt into allout war. The battle system
happens on a field where positioning
matters. Characters can move freely
within their range before performing
actions. Combat focuses on exploiting
enemy weaknesses to gain advantage,
using link attacks between paired
characters, and activating powerful
brave orders that provide temporary team
buffs. The Ormet system lets you
customize characters by slotting
different quartz, magical stones to
learn spells, and boost stats. What
makes this game truly special is its
incredible world building. NPCs have
their own stories that develop after
major events, making the world feel
alive and lived in.
[Music]
Strike
there, Yuna. I got it. Yes.
Unicorn Overlord mixes tactical RPG
battles with a unique Kingdom Liberation
gameplay loop. You play as Alang, the
exiled prince of Cornneia, on a quest to
reclaim his homeland from the Zenoron
Empire that took everything from him.
The game's world map lets you freely
move your army between locations, with
each liberated town providing resources
and soldiers for your cause. The battle
system is semi-automated in a refreshing
way. You arrange your units into
formations of up to five characters, set
their positions, and then watch them
execute your strategy against enemy
formations. During these clashes, you
can trigger special abilities at key
moments to turn the tide. Each character
belongs to a class like knight, mage, or
archer. With over 60 recruitable
characters to build your army,
characters can form bonds through shared
battles, unlocking powerful combo
attacks. Between battles, you'll manage
your growing rebellion by equipping
troops, setting up new formations, and
completing side quests to earn the trust
of different regions.
Brace yourself.
Does this suit you? Witness the royal
blade. Octopath Traveler 2 improves on
the original in every way. The game
follows eight new travelers. Oswald the
scholar, Casty the apothecary, Throne
the thief, Teos the cleric, Ochetta the
hunter, Particio the merchant, Aga the
dancer, and Hikari the warrior. Each
character has two unique path actions,
one for daytime and another for
nighttime, like throne stealing during
the day or ambushing people at night.
The battle system enhances the break and
boost mechanics from the first game by
adding latent powers, unique character
abilities that charge as you take
damage, creating powerful comeback
opportunities. The dayight cycle affects
not just path actions, but also changes
town populations, available quests, and
even some enemies. The most significant
improvement is how character stories now
intersect more meaningfully with paired
travel stories that unlock when certain
characters reach specific chapters. The
HD 2D visual style looks even better
with more dynamic lighting, water
effects, and environmental details. It's
my turn.
What's our plan of attack? The Legend of
Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak starts a
brand new story arc in the Massive
Trails series, making it a perfect
jumping on point for newcomers. Set in
the Republic of Calvert, you play as
Vanner Cried, a sprigen who takes on odd
jobs that fall between what the police
and bracer guilds handle. The battle
system happens on a field where position
matters. Characters can move freely
within their range before attacking.
Combat focuses on breaking enemy shields
by hitting their weaknesses, using team
attacks between linked characters, and
activating powerful arts, magic, and
crafts, special abilities. The game
introduces a new hollow core system that
lets characters transform and gain
enhanced abilities mid battle. Outside
of combat, you'll use Van's detective
skills to solve cases around the city of
Edith, talking to witnesses and
gathering clues. What makes this game
special is its incredibly detailed
world. NPCs have their own stories that
change after each story event, making
the city feel alive.
There.

me. Suicen 1 and 2 HD remaster brings
two classic RPGs from the PlayStation
era to the Switch with beautiful updated
graphics while keeping the charm that
made them legendary. Both games are set
in the same world, but take place in
different regions and time periods. In
Suicin, you play as the son of a great
general who joins a liberation army
against a corrupt empire. In Suicin,
you're a young soldier caught in another
war 3 years later. What makes these
games special is the 108 stars of
destiny system. In each game, you can
recruit 108 different characters to join
your cause. Many of these characters can
join your battle party, while others
help by opening shops, upgrading your
weapons, or adding features to your
headquarters. The battle system is
classic turn-based combat with six party
members instead of the usual four or
five. Both games also feature exciting
one-on-one duels and large-scale
strategic army battles that change up
the gameplay.
[Music]
Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of the
most freedomfilled RPGs ever made, where
you can solve problems in countless
different ways. Set in a world where
people with magical powers called
sorcerers are being hunted, you play as
a sorcerer prisoner being taken to an
island called Fort Joy. The turnbased
combat system is all about using the
environment and combining different
elements. Cast a rain spell and then use
lightning to electrify the water or
create oil and then set it on fire. Each
character moves a certain distance per
turn and has action points to spend on
attacks, spells, or using items. What
makes this game special is how almost
every problem has multiple solutions
based on your skills and creativity. You
can talk your way past enemies, sneak
around them, find hidden paths, or face
them head-on in combat. You can play as
one of several pre-made characters with
their own stories, or create your own.
Each pre-made character has unique
dialogue options and quests based on
their background.
Dragon Quest 11S is the complete version
of a classic JRPG adventure that both
honors traditions and makes them
accessible for today's players. You play
as the Luminary, a chosen hero destined
to save the world of Erdria from a dark
force called the Dark One. The game's
battle system is traditional turn-based
combat where you select actions for your
party from menus, but with modern
touches like being able to move
characters around the battlefield. Even
though it doesn't affect gameplay, what
sets it apart is the PEP system, where
characters enter powered up states
during battle that enable special
combination attacks with other party
members. Each character has a skill tree
where you spend points to learn new
abilities and boost stats, allowing you
to customize how they develop. The
Switch version includes a special 2D
mode that transforms the entire game
into a classic 16-bit style RPG, letting
you experience the same story in two
completely different ways. The game is
split into acts with major story
developments that completely change your
journey and goals.
Get him.
[Music]
Go on. You can do it.
Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door
brings the Gamecube Classic to Switch
with updated graphics while keeping the
unique charm and gameplay that made fans
beg for this remake for years. The story
follows Mario traveling to Rogueport
after Princess Peach sends him a
treasure map only to find she's gone
missing. The adventure centers around
collecting seven crystal stars and
opening the legendary Thousand-Year Door
to discover what's behind it. The battle
system happens on a stage with an
audience watching. The better you
perform, using timed button presses to
improve attacks and defense, the more
the crowd loves you, giving you more
star power for special moves. The
setting looks like a papercraft world,
with Mario able to slip through cracks
by turning sideways or roll up into a
tube to roll under obstacles. Throughout
the journey, Mario gains partners with
unique abilities both in and out of
battle, a gloomba who can help identify
enemies, a Koopa who can throw his shell
at distant objects, and more.
