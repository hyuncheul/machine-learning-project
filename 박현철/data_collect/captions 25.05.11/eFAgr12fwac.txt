oh no question I think it's we're seeing
a 3D Mario today yep I realized that
it's been over a decade since the last
Donkey Kong game and between the theme
park and move the Mario movie I think
that that makes a lot of sense
yeah um I don't think any Zelda news
today um we just had Echoes of wisdom a
few months ago
uh tears of the kingdom was the year
before that I think it's too oh baby oh
my God oh my God oh my God oh my this
only happens once every eight years and
it's happening right
now oh my
plan both are three
make you were saying yesterday they
could blow the waters with new Animal

today okay that would bring the crowd to
even I'd be happy with that yeah like
the crowd would go wild Animal Crossing
six is this year or next
[Music]
year well everybody in TR to say silk
song so yeah what's that sequel Hollow
night promising that for six years

depending on the time of day and wethers
the atmosphere will change oh this is
awesome Mario Theft

like 24
players oh God you can go off the
r everywhere in this world there are
multiple checkpoints along the

World in free
Ro
Yeah by going Offroad you can explore
new areas and rs so drive wherever your
heart takes

right there you can also go for scenic
drives with friends and even take photos
together at different
locations there's a penguin as a

same place additionally game chat
supports the Nintendo switch parental
controls app and different settings can
be adjusted for example whether
parental when a child wants to use Game
