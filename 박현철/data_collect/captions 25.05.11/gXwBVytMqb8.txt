350 how much can you get it at it's po
as [ __ ] holy [ __ ] 349 it's like 349 it's
like 300 3 300 349 yeah I guess if you

it's not that bad for a console right
it's like 300
so it's going to be
like honestly it'll be like 400 450 it's

players let me go ahead and just clarify
something for everyone a 24 player
content creator Lobby is not happening
let me just be very clear
okay that ain't going to happen okay
maybe if like maybe if we're all in
different discords but like 24 people in
one F I don't even know if you can fit
244 people in one Discord I don't even
know if that's possible so many voices
so many voices bro what if you get
invited to one see like if I get invited
to like a 24 player content creator
thing and like you know I'm in my own
Discord or like I could be in a Discord
with like one or two other people I'll
be all right with that right but
like like 24 content creators in one
Discord nah bro that's too much that's
too much that that's that I'm not I
don't want to do that like six groups of
four it's something like that you know
some light but like maybe I'll do it
with viewers oh dude that would be
that'd be good content now that' be good
content one versus 23

you think this is a [ __ ] show the
[ __ ] what do you think this is
bro all right chat what are our
predictions for this direct now to be
fair and to
clarify apparently this [ __ ] direct
is an hour
long so like they probably got some [ __ ]
the
show they'll probably spend like 30
minutes showing off the console right
Wild jersey they give a sub they'll
probably spend like 30 minutes showing
off the console they'll probably show a
new Mario game a new Zelda game maybe
perhaps probably going to have some
Pokemon I don't expect any Pokemon gonna
be honest I think all their attention is
on Za I'm locked hoping for more Za news
bro you know what's so funny we were on
like this huge Hiatus of no Za news and
now we've gotten so much within the last
month it's
crazy like we had a whole Pokemon Direct
a whole Nintendo Direct with news and
now like we're expecting even more news
than another [ __ ] direct I'm not
expecting any more Pokemon news if there
is I'll be impressed I don't think there
will be uh but I'll be that' be I'd be
impressed probably some random [ __ ] too
yeah they'll probably show how like if
you have an old D an old switch you can
probably like connect games to the new
Switch which I think they already showed
in the old direct but they'll probably
CL I it more in this one um I knew that
they were not showing things for months
yeah maybe they'll make a new Super
Mario Brothers game I'm expecting
something in the Odyssey like either
Odyssey 2 Mario Galaxy 3 or just a whole
new game that they make up who knows
Lucifer thank you for the
sub baby someone just B BB W Rogue thank
for definitely going to be Maro Kart 10
a lot about the system and I bet there's
going to be something about the live
action Z a movie since they announced
its opening date I don't think so it
literally it literally says Nintendo
switch 2 [ __ ] everything in this direct
is going to be about the Nintendo switch
2 I don't think they'll talk about a
[ __ ]
liveaction a new Smash
Brothers that'd be
crazy that that'd be crazy as a [ __ ]
like exclusive that'd be [ __ ] Wild
that'd be like I don't think so that'd
be [ __ ] wild
