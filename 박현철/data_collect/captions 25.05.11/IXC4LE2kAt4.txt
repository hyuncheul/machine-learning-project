All I know is Blueest Star. I think he
lives ini UK which is a country. So
that's not Dachon. And then Jaden, he
lives in United States. Yeah. But I
don't know what city or town or state
they live in. So yeah. And how would I
be doxing them when? I don't even know
their address. And I would never know
their address because that's private
information.
Um,
so
yeah, people that are saying I doxed
them, even though I didn't, is Jeff
Froen, Trainer Mystic. I didn't dox
them. I just They said what town they
what what state or town or whatever they
live in. They said it on their Instagram
bio.
Anyways, guys, yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's
what Dachin is, but I didn't do that.
Okay, here's proof. Sorry.
Also, trainer weather up in
Charlotte, North Carolina.
I just asked him how the weather is up
there. He said it to himself that he
lives there. He didn't say his address.
He said the state he lives in or
town. So, here's um trolls in chat.
Wait, let me go back. How do I go back?
I need to um go

Jeffro, Daytona, Tart, and Vinnie.
They're all
trolls.
Any here's the stupid part. Not to
mention this. He said this. Not to
mention you all should wear,
bro. No, I
didn't. Let's continue watching this.
See, that's what he's talking about.
right here. This is How is this showing
where I
live? This is not me showing where I
live. It's me
showing some a weather incident that
happened in my city. A
big ice storm. It's me showing a
neighborhood. That's what it is. It's me
showing a neighborhood that got hit
really bad from the ice storm that
happened two months ago in my
city. Do you see any houses? No. It
doesn't show any addresses like I don't
know. Let's make up one. 55 Donkey Kong
Street. Like come on. It does not show
any address or house anything.
It's just a street.
This ain't even my street.
Oh, workers messed up my dad's coffee at
Tim Horns. I can hear he's mad. Anyways,
but no, seriously,
like this ain't doxing myself when I
literally just showed an external habit.
That's the stupidest part of the video.
How they think this is doc. This is not
docin.
Anyways, and yes, he took weird pictures
of himself. Okay. And I'm just trying to
be
funny. I want to put a smile on people's
faces, especially if people are going
through a rough day like time or having
a rough day.
Anyways, so yeah, this picture. Okay.
So, yeah.
So,
yeah. Yeah. One sec. And he says this.
Yeah. About um a YouTuber, good good
friend of mine. He says, "Writz and I
can confirm Blink Games of 161 collabing
with B because this Oh, Blink never um
confirmed that. He never DM'd me
privately and told me that. So, as far
as I'm aware, I doubt that's
true. Okay. I hope you all understand is
a bad person. The dogs feel peeing. It's
peeled to harass people. I do not get
peel to harass people. And um I'm not a
bad person. I ain't perfect, but I ain't
a bad person. I'm just a decent human
being. And I do not dox people.
Anyways, that's the video. Yeah. All
right. Thanks for watching. Goodbye. All
right. Well, that's the
video.
Anyways, Mr. Nope man, welcome to
channel. How are you doing? Well,
um, okay, bro.
Really? I'm getting all these weird like
accounts in my chat and it's it's really
annoying.
Like, anyways, um, that's that's enough
of that.
Um, sorry I'm wasting your all you guys
time. I want to
race. I need to um fix my camera though.
Come on. Okay. Filters. Edit
filters. Where's chroma key? There it
is. All right. Anyways, that's that.
Okay.
Um, so I I know we haven't raced yet,
but we'll race. I'll open up Mario
Karina. Actually, I'm not going to open
up a lobby cuz trolls will probably draw
when I'm gone. I'm probably going to
have my phone on me while I'm gone
because trolls will probably drop my
chat. Actually, I'll just leave it up
here and when I come back, I'll probably
have to just ban a few accounts unless
mods have taken care of it.
But anyways, I'm going to go eat real
quick. I should be back in
um give me like 15 minutes. Be right
back and I will race. Anyways, be right
back.
And I'm back. Let's play some Mario
Kart. Here we
go. I had a family get at least one
troll in the chat while I was gone.
Well, yeah, I'm correct. We got it. We
got one. Saying you suck, boo. Well, I
banned him. Anyways, let's
race Yoshi game. Harry also
sum well radio gamer says Bradley why
have you been making comments to people
I haven't people are just spreading
false information about
[Music]
me people think that I'm not allowed to
get mad if they make a video making of
making fun of my mega Mario Kart Mega a
clap, but I don't like when they do
that. So, they should stop. Anyways,
um, so we'll go Mario. He's in the
thumbnail. Yoda Mario. Or is he call
Mario Yoda? Nope. Yoda Mario. Anyways,
let's race.
just go with whatever subject I'm just
going to go with.
Um, you know what? Let's go with the
inside trip
combo. Okay, let's
go.
Anyone want to VC? Now's your chance to
join. It's for lunch. Two breakfast
sandwiches. So yeah.
All
right, let's start the races.
All right.
Um, so I start off with streaming Lunar
Colony, but that's a battle track. It's
not a course. So, we'll go with a course
that's like Space 2. So, we'll go um 3DS
Rainbow
Road cuz it's like kind of in space. So,
yeah. those like planets and all that.
Yeah, all that stuff. So, yeah, that's
that. Okay, toad circuit. Fine. Let's
go. Hey, welcome to Lobby Noah.
[Music]
Thank you, Soyan. Keep an eye on the
chat. Make sure no unwanted guests
join. Hey Solam, if you want, you can
join VC. I mean, if you don't want to
race, that's okay. But if you want, you
can join BC.
[Music]
First place, Ches.
So, I had a bacon breakfast sandwich and
a sausage breakfast sandwich from Tim
Horns for um
lunch. Yeah, I just skipped breakfast
and yeah, that was my lunch. I skipped
breakfast. That was my lunch. Okay.
Um probably stay. Let's go
with Yo, someone else joined. Oh no,
that's not nice. I think he got he might
have got a communication error, I
believe. All right, Mario Kart Stadia.
So, I will also um everyone be doing a
Mario Kart stream later today at 6
o'clock. So, make sure to join for that.
I'm going to be doing a lot of Mario
Kart Deluxe on his channel now because
we are um so close to Mario Kart World
release. And then once Mario Kart World
comes out, oh, you'll barely see Mario
Kra on on his channel and you'll mainly
see Mario Kart on his channel. always
streaming that game so
much. Seems like drift combo ain't too
bad.
Nice. Okay.
I I don't know why I let go of that
green shell. That was stupid of me
to pop up right behind me. Wherever he
is name sounds familiar.
Okay, first place. I'll take it. GG's.
That was a really good race. Not going
to
lie. Same with the one last one before
that on
circuit. Race before
that. Okay. Um I want to go shopping.
So, let's go to Coconut
Mall. I don't actually want to go
shopping like in real life, like real
life shopping, but I want to shop at
Coconut Mall, like you know, Mario Kart
Sane.
Yeah, let's go
shopping Coconut Mall.
All right, never mind. Maple Treeway.
Another good we track. You notice all
the three tracks that I were selected by
me, Bup, and Noah, they're all Wii
tracks. We have Wii, Coconut Mall, Wei,
Rainbow Road, and Wei Maple Tree. Wow,
what a coincidence.
Nice. The best we track of all those
ones in this game of those three options
is definitely the Rainbow Road. Then
probably Coconut Mall. But still, these
tracks are good. Yeah, this track's
good, you
know. Yeah, this track um is better on
the Wii, but it's still really good in
this game. So, yeah.
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
Second place, Chies.
Let's go across it.
Nice. We Rainbow Road. I love this
track.
[Music]
How did I survive that and not fall off?
That is crazy, dude.
Railing. This combo's actually pretty
good.
[Music]
[Music]
Shoot, I fell off. Uh, hello to her.
Join VC.
Hello.
Hey, let's see who it is. Sparky. Hey,
how are you?
Hey, I just came back from shopping.
Nice. I'm going to have to turn you up
after this race cuz I'm having trouble
hearing you. Just give me a minute. I'll
do it now. Okay. Say something.
Hello. There we go. I can hear you
better. Um, anyways, how are you?
Nice. Want to introduce yourself?
Hello everyone.
[Music]
very I'm here.
Nice.
Hey Cherry, welcome back to the live
stream. How are you doing? Hope you're
doing well.
Bought myself lunch.
[Music]
Hey,
hey, hockey puck. How's it going? Um,
hey, what the hell are all these
allegations that I've been seeing? Yeah,
it's just a bunch of trolls saying stuff
that's not true.
Yeah, it all started when someone like
made a video like making fun of my mega
collab because it turned out to be a
disaster and they expected me to not get
mad over it.
I mean, to be fair, you did say that
someone lived in like North Carolina or
somewhere. Yeah, cuz they do.
I mean, yeah,
but how do you know that no one's just
going to go to North Carolina and look
for that one singular person? They don't
know their address.
I mean, I mean, I I guess that that's
true, but you know what? They they still
know where to look.
Turkey. Well, they said it in their
Instagram bio that they live there, so
it's technically their fault.
I mean, I I guess,
but that's like two separate that's
that's two separate platforms.
Yeah, but it's like still on the
internet.
Like if people don't want people to know
where what city or state or wherever
they live and then they shouldn't say on
their like Instagram or Facebook or
whatever on social media in general
where but the difference is that pretty
much everyone has YouTube. Not not
everyone has Instagram.
Yeah, I
know. But like they still should be sane
lives there like
or at least if they don't want like
Yeah.
Like it's just they they did this to
their self.
And like I'd understand if they told me
to stop and I didn't stop, but they're
telling me to not say that again. So,
I'm not saying it again. Even though I
think I should, I'm not because I listen
when people tell me to stop.
How are you doing, Hockey Puck?
Good. Nice. Want to introduce yourself?
Uh, I'm Hockey Puck. I'm a reaction
content maker and I just want to play
some Mario Kart. Nice. Except um I might
have to go in a little bit. That's okay.
I'm here now. Okay, let's start.
I'll just pick all the randoms.
Oh my god, we had so many other better
rainbows and we got that one. Really?
Yeah.
I hate this track. Well, that would have
been my third pick. Anyway,
I hate this
track. This track sucks, especially on
um 200cc. I hate this track.
Hang on a second. They aren't good.
At least we're getting this out of the
way. True. Oh, there's Bob, the one that

No idea.
Are you serious?
What?
Who is this player? I don't know. I have

nighttime horses like drone.
We ran a road. Nice.
So stadium will be next up on the
chopping block. I forgot what the dragon

Okay, there we

Excellent. Nice. How did I get the item

stall right now. That's yours.
All right.
Wait, how is Le behind you now?

Wow. I'm one point away from [ __ ]
This was the final race, right? Yes, it
was. Still second.
Yikes.
I said

They ran me over everyone else.
That was weird.
All right, who should I play as now?
Let's go Peach.
What? I want to un add but
character really speaks Star Wars.
[Music]
All right. See you TK. You're not going
to be able to join any matches if you
join back.
Star Wars character most the
others. Let's
go. There has to be only once.
Easy. Easiest track ever.
Yep. That is a easy track if you know
what you're doing.
Of course I do. You do have to pay
attention to the cars and where they
operate.
In a way, Animal Crossing can be a
nighttime track because the winter
theme, but it's rare.
Yeah, it's one of four.
Yeah, let's see.
Technically, it counts if it's just me.
So, I'm probably going to be stuck on
that for a minute.
I hate this map. Oh, boy. I love this
map.
I only like it if it's lower CC.
Long. That's what it is. You don't like
it on 200, but you only like it on 100
150 only, right?
I have to direct it the right way or I
fly off the map.
That might happen.
I do like 200cc.
I like I like it already. So you thought
you could hit me? Crazy.
You were trailing me anyway.
Yeah, you weren't. I saw you.
Oh my god. How did I hit? How did the
How did they hit you?
Oh, that was a miss. All right, never
mind.
I just What the No, never mind. I think
I did it. I lost it.
The I was invincible. Trust me. No one
hit me.
You wish you did. Yeah, you hit him.
Yeah. Yeah, you did. He's at red.
There's so many people behind me.
Yeah.
That actually helped me. Watch out. Bomb

rocket. Oh my god.
Freaking mushrooms. You built a rocket.
Get away from me. Get away from me.
Get away from me. Get away from Get away
from me.
Two brains. How do you roll two
boomerang?
How do you get two boomerangs? How did
someone fall? Get away from me.
Never.
I did the shortcut. I missed the
shortcut. I'm so good at the game. I
fell off the map. Yay.
Someone's still behind me somehow. Never
mind.
What the Oh, you think you're funny now,
huh? Don't think so. Still haven't
invite Oh my god. Seriously, guys, right
now. That was right. Wrong time. Wrong.
I'm losing.
I'm about to build turned off on me. How
dare you? Third place. I'll take it
again.
I love the game.
Good comeback there. Was a good comeback
I made so far.
Right where I saw Bradley.
Try this again.
Mario.
Yeah, I can. He really wants it. He
really wants my stadium though. He
really wants it. It's a nighttime
course. We already did all going for
night time.
As you can see, stars.
Yep.
Typically, meaning Ninja Highway will be
showing up.
Okay. Of course. Yeah. Let's do it.
I think Golden Peach is the best
character on Ninja, by the way. Oh, that
means you did.
We'll see. What else? Oh, man. I hate
electrod electro the only flower cups
that take place at night, right?
I think it's inside a building, but it's
in outside at the same time. Twisted
mansion is both dark.
So, this is not
I don't know what to rank this cuz it's
just like weird.
a couple nights in this game.
You're not hitting me.
I
Yeah, it's night time. You can see you
can see the moon is Oh, yeah. I see it.
It is night time. Yeah, I was also in
the green. I can see. But it looks like
we're inside a building. Yeah, it more
like a stage. Did you lose your super
horn? Seriously, it's not going to help.
Oh, there we go. Doesn't show up on my
screen.
My crew thought they were smart.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it's going to be all right.
There we go.
Bradley super eight

You were a boomerang.
Oh, please. Damn it.
Boss got bombed.
I got a Oh, I'm not passing you. Who's
that? Maybe I will pass you. Shoot.
No, we turned the wrong way. Are you
serious? Did you? What? So what is it?
What?
Freaking chunky.
Well, that's the 99 prime force of the
star I've dealt with. At
least Bowser's castle actually is dark
as well.
Yeah, true. It is. You could argue there
is two night forces in the fashion.
Is it his arc? Excuse me.
Castle. You know what? He's voting for
the same one again.
Oh, I am. He m
They must like it. They must like put
the
mansion. I only like it cuz it's a
Halloween forest and there's only two of
them in this entire game.
You know, there's a lot of snow horses.
Have you all played CTPG?
That's the modded Mario Kart, right?
Yeah. Yeah. No, I haven't. There's a
bunch of horses and kind of Yeah, it's
pretty fun. Yes, we got stadium. So, now
I can hunt for that twisted bench.
CGP is a It's a It's a hack game. Yeah.
Yep. Mario Kart Wii. Pretty fun. has
allers in it along with other parts.
It's a good It's a good game. I saw the
gameplay once. It's a good game. Yeah, I
watched
it. Knock.
Nope. No, I didn't. Apparently, I dodged
it.
What's he know? You probably saw me and
were like, "Oh, I'm going to throw a
green gel.
Well, you could be trying to do that
trick. Go around the whole thing.
Really?
Seriously.
Oops. Red show. Okay. All right. Oh. Oh,
stop hitting me, man. Come on. You could
have touched me.
You did it now. Oh my gosh. I'm Mario
Gamer. Uh, dude, that's not going to
help you. Trust me. Never did.
Oh, what do you think? Hey, may the
forth be with you all. Hey, Mustach, how

Oh, the funny one. That's funny.
Funny one is crazy. I like the I don't
think so. I disagree.
And

Both following forces take place at
night. All right. Does he know he's
choosing the track? He doesn't need he

track.
I'm track reason.
Now he knows. Okay. Twisted. There we
go. See, he got it.
What's next? They're going to go castle

bomb. Are you serious? Someone threw a
bomb at you
right as I landed. I I I only had a
