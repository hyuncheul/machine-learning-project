(Top Kassadin first pick)  
Oh, thank goodness. Shen?  
I saw these four picks and...  
I just instinctively picked Kassadin.  
Luckily, it's Shen?  
That makes it playable, right?  
I mean, it's not like Shen is weak...  
But it's not to the point where I can't farm.  
Yeah, they probably picked Shen...  
Thinking it was top Yone.  
We swapped our bans too.  
Shen probably still thinks...  
He's facing top Yone.  
"Oh, Kassadin is a one-trick..."  
"They swapped lanes!"  
LOL  
That's what they're thinking.  
Got that 5 gold~  
I won’t trade in lane.  
I'll fight when I get my items.  
Did you know Shen is actually strong early game?  
It’s fine, just think of it as giving up one kill.  
It’s not a big deal.  
Nice.  
Drained his mana~  
Going smoothly.  
Honestly, at this point...  
I think I've already succeeded.  
This is already a success!  
Just need to avoid dying to Vi now.  
Just farm it out.  
Never give him the taunt-Flash range...  
Hmm...  
Sorry, sorry.  
Let's keep going a bit more.  
Feels like we’re looking at a 13-minute game.  
That’s why this setup is good.  
This is why this situation is good~  
Sorry.  
I was trying to move over here.  
Can't do this, it's tricky.  
Maybe it's better to use Flash safely?  
The situation down there is a bit unfortunate, huh?  
So close.  
This isn’t looking good, huh?  
Vi and Ezreal are becoming monsters.  
Ah... So close.  
Yone’s ult?  
Even just this is good for us, right?  
Let me just level up one more time, guys.  
Let me ping it first...  
Huh?  
Baron is up?  
That's unfortunate.  
Guess we have to give up Baron.  
Need to hit level 16 and focus on teamfights, right?  
Their comp isn’t exactly…  
…a comp that’s good at dealing with Kassadin.  
I’m back online.  
Sorry.  
Might be better to just teleport here.  
Nice.  
I can teleport!  
Ignore Shen and just push, okay?  
Good.  
Let’s go in quick, now!  
How about going for Hwei too?  
He’s gonna come out alone.  
He’ll definitely come to clean up, right?  
Good.  
So close.  
I’m on my way.  
Nice.  
Why not just kill everyone except Shen?  
LOL  
Just leave Shen alone!  
Yone, I don’t know, man…  
You’re on your own, man…  
No, no.  
We can’t push this.  
Uh...  
Oh!  
Good.  
How about just sneaking in...  
And wiping them all out, guys?  
gg  
Hmm.  
Good job.  
So top is first pick.  
Hmm...  
Should I just pick Sylas as first pick?  
Ah~  
My bad!  
LOL  
Darius... Ham is no good!  
Sorry, sorry, Darius Ham is not it.  
Top, come out!  
You're first pick anyway.  
Quinn!  
What's good against Quinn?  
What should I pick against Quinn, guys?  
Malphite's good against Quinn?  
But this comp... Malphite...  
Malphite(?)  
Nice and tanky~  
LOL  
Should I go Comet?  
Is Approach Velocity not that great on him?  
Should I try this?  
But picking Malphite...  
When the only AP threat is Vex...  
And Vex is a burst champ,  
So they lack sustained damage.  
If I just scale well, it'll be fun.  
Shield vs. Doran's Ring!  
Ring.  
Let's go Ring...  
Level 1 mana pool at 280... Legendary.  
Is it always like this?  
Shouldn't it at least be 400?  
I just need to stack up Manaflow Band at level 1, right?  
Ah.  
Shouldn't have given him that range...  
I tried to farm a minion and gave him the gap.  
But even with that... I still won the trade?  
Nice.  
Yeah, I'm winning this~  
Okay~  
But there's no need to rush, right?  
Act like I'm not going in?  
Help!  
Heave-ho~  
If I hit him with Q...  
Wouldn't he use E to escape?  
Guess not?  
Alright, let's go in~  
Hi there!  
Huh? Wait, Vi...  
Why are you attacking and leaving, jungler?  
If you just went all-in here...  
That would have been a juicy play, ah~  
These guys, seriously...  
Unbelievable.  
Okay~ Good job!  
Alright, I'm gonna recall now.  
Good luck~  
Oh dear~  
Brain-off tank build.  
Straight to Armguard.  
Never releasing it!  
Alright, let's go with Armguard~  
Wow, you reacted to that?  
Okay, I'll give you that one.  
Let me get some advantage...  
Quinn no flash~  
LOL  
Guys! Quinn...  
I think she's gonna roam!  
Watch out for Quinn!  
Let's push while trimming the wave a bit?  
Instead of freezing too much,  
It's better to push slowly.  
They're definitely going to fight over there.  
Yeah, I'm already starting to push it~  
Huh?  
Yeah, but there's nothing you can do about that.  
Even if you're careful, it's unavoidable.  
Sylas just fed three kills by himself, huh?  
"I'm getting denied in mid with no wards, what am I supposed to do?"  
"I'm just going to keep dying."  
What kind of irresponsible comment is that...  
Sylas, dude!  
What are you even talking about...  
Ah...  
Hold on, things are critical at the bottom.  
Quinn's basically giving up on laning...  
Ah...  
Good job.  
Boom boom.  
Okay, let me clear this?  
Let's go.  
Press recall immediately!  
Can I make it?  
Hey, minion!  
Sorry.  
Ah, because it's Quinn!  
Ah~  
Ah...  
But I didn't die, right?  
It's fine~  
Ning ning ning ning ning (?)  
Oh, nice.  
"It's fine."  
"Ning ning ning ning ning."  
LOOOOOOL  
Hey, it's fine, it's fine.  
Everything's going to work out, guys~  
I don't know anymore.  
Vi, I don't think this is it.  
Vi, I'm pretty sure this isn’t it.  
Ah, I really don't think this is it.  
Let's not go.  
Don't get caught up in that.  
Shut your ears!  
Stay strong! Like a rock.  
Ah, so close.  
Just give them what they want~ guys.  
Uh... No way that works, right?  
Don't get caught up in this, ever.  
You know what I mean, right?  
The moment you get hasty and teleport,  
you’re doomed too.  
You have to stay solid in games like this! At least I do.  
Sorry.  
Next.  
Hey, how did that miss?  
I'm heading there!  
Legendary!  
A legendary moment!  
Next.  
Huh? What was that?  
You're coming in?  
LOOOOOL  
I'm a mountain right now!  
You guys won’t catch me!  
This isn’t gonna be easy.  
I don’t know anymore~  
Don’t just blow your ult!  
Next.  
Come get me!  
LOOOOOL  
Come here! I'll give you a hug!  
Step, step, step...  
Let’s go.  
Give them what they want!  
Please don't...  
Don't do it!  
Don't do it...  
Just give them what they want, guys!  
Just don’t all die!  
Hey, but Fear is down!  
Come here~ I'll give you a hug!  
Ah~  
Save me!  
Thank you, Sylas.  
You saved my life.  
Hmm..  
That Quinn..  
Come here~ I'll give you a hug!  
Next.  
Right now, I could probably win 1v10 against Quinn.  
LOOOOOL  
That's about how it feels right now.  
Nice.  
Hmm..  
Gotta do what needs to be done..  
Solid as a rock~  
Good job.  
Pushed it cleanly, right?  
Armor at 468! Legendary!  
LOOOOL Wait..  
Hold on..  
Legendary moment!  
Vex? Sorry, sorry.  
Gonna ignore you for a sec!  
Okay, okay, sorry, sorry.  
Armor at 524..  
Legendary Malphite moment.  
Should I go for Jak’Sho here?  
To stack some MR too?  
What do you guys think?  
I’m just gonna go, guys!  
Maybe Vex didn’t engage because I used TP?  
That’s what I think.  
LOOOOOL  
It’s Malphite, guys!  
Bro’s armor is at 500~  
It’s Malphite!  
Next.  
Vex's specialty!  
Just one MR item...  
And I’ll barely take any damage.  
Let’s get some MR items.  
Oops.  
Wait, but it’s an AP dragon?  
What do we do about this?  
I’ll go too, I guess.  
Four AP dragons?  
It's Malphite!  
Bro’s literally invincible right now~  
It’s Malphite!  
Sorry, sorry.  
I’ve got 534 armor, sorry about that.  
LOOOOOL  
Sorry, sorry.  
Sorry for turning that into a 5v1.  
BAM!  
Huh?  
Let me recall first, then I'll join in.  
I like to be thorough.  
Ah, whatever~  
Let’s just buy anything!  
Good job.  
Sorry, sorry!  
I’ve got 600 armor, sorry about that.  
Sorry, sorry.  
Someone, come catch me.  
Or not.  
LOOOOOL  
Sorry, sorry!  
Sorry for not dying.  
Come play with me, Lee Sin!  
Sorry, sorry.  
Sorry for being so strong.  
Good job.  
Kinda feel like building Fimbulwinter now?  
How big would the shield be?  
Should I try Fimbulwinter?  
LOOOOOL  
Oops, sorry.  
I'll just ignore it!  
Sorry, sorry.  
Fimbulwinter... how much is it?  
2100 gold?  
Ah, I kinda want to keep playing, guys.  
Isn't it a bit too early to end?  
Guys, try to stop them!  
What are you guys doing?!  
I gotta buy items for this...  
Wait, hold on, the size of the shield...  
Let me see it just once!  
Just let me see it once!  
Where is it...  
Scuttle Crab!  
Just once!  
Huh?  
Wait, there's no size change?  
Then why get the red potion?  
LOOOOL  
Wait...  
Oh, really?  
Ah, it’s the same size~  
Aha.  
Didn't know that.  
Wow... Malphite top damage, legend.  
Damage taken...  
Huh?  
Huh?!  
Did they not want to hit me?  
LOOOOL  
Uh... good job.  
"We gotta check the damage reduction."  
Ah, really?  
Graph...  
Ah...  
Oh, okay~ Yeah, I was first place!  
It's kinda awkward, but...  
I was first place~  
"Just call it full damage Malphite."  
Yeah, let's just say I went full damage Malphite.  
I got top damage, you know.  
Aatrox?  
But if it's Tahm Kench vs Aatrox...  
I don’t think I can win.  
Sylas?  
Ah...  
Huh?  
Should I go for it?  
The opponent didn’t use TP either,  
so they might want to recall once.  
Next.  
They underestimated Sylas too much.  
Take a loss.  
But Sylas vs Aatrox...  
It’s not that bad of a matchup, actually.  
Aatrox seems better against ranged champs.  
Good.  
Nice~  
Since they don’t have TP... let’s push this.  
Ignore Lee Sin.  
Ah!  
Cannon minion...  
Ah, I can’t hold back now!  
LOOOL  
With 1300 gold?  
I can't resist!  
Unlucky.  
Oh, this is good, though!  
Next.  
I’ve got two masks, you fool~  
Good.  
Not bad.  
Ah, I’m dead.  
Unlucky.  
Was I being too greedy?  
I have TP, though.  
Legendary trick show!  
LOOOOOL  
What are you doing?  
Legend.  
Naturally, on to the Herald!  
Aatrox is still chasing...  
...an imaginary Kindred.  
Why are they running away like this?  
I should recall...  
and look for a TP angle.  
Okay, my bad~  
What... huh?  
League is harmful...  
LOOOL  
Uh...  
League is harmful.  
Suddenly Diamond 2...  
Huh...  
Rank protection.  
You know, I’ve been thinking...  
Back in high school, my second language...  
...was Japanese.  
In the end, learning any language...  
...starts with memorization.  
And I hated memorizing.  
Because I didn’t study,  
my Japanese teacher...  
...really hated me.  
What if I had studied harder?  
That was basically free...  
Well, not free, I paid tuition,  
but still, I was getting educated.  
I should have followed along more.  
“If you can speak Japanese...”  
If they asked me that in Japanese...  
...with a Korean accent...?  
LOOOOL  
Ask me like that!  
Instead of Hiragana or Katakana,  
just write it in Korean.  
Then I could somewhat talk.  
Ah, kyou wa... umm...  
Samui desu ne!  
“That means ‘It’s cold today,’ right?”  
Ah, hajimemashite!  
Watashi wa...  
Kankokujin desu!  
Yu.. yuryuba(?) desu.  
LOOOL  
What’s the enemy comp?  
Is it Akali top, maybe?  
Should I lock in Sylas again?  
If I don’t pick it, they might.  
They’ve got Alistar.  
I'll just lock it in.  
Is it really Akali top?  
Wait, what’s Smolder doing?  
Support Wei and...  
Hmm...  
Tristana mid and Akali top?  
They’ll die if they don’t flash, right?  
No flash Q?  
Ok.  
Three minions, yummy~  
Not bad, right?  
WOW  
That was a good try though.  
I think they misplayed a bit there.  
Wasn’t that a losing angle for me?  
But I can kinda see...  
...what they were trying to do.  
But oh well, it failed!  
If you fail,  
you gotta take the loss!  
LOOOOL  
Meanwhile, bot is losing too?  
Your life’s over, man.  
Alright, good luck?  
That hurts so bad...  
Ah!  
I gotta dodge the E!  
Ok~  
So, what now?  
Ah, sorry.  
So what do I do now?  
Play it safe again!  
Every second...  
...the situation changes.  
Level up, legend~  
LOOOOOL  
Unlucky, Akali.  
If you’re unlucky, you lose~  
That’s just how the game works.  
“Wait, really?”  
Yes, really~  
If you’re unlucky, you lose.  
“You calculated that, right?”  
Of course~  
It was all part of the plan.  
Totally calculated~  
But you know what I mean?  
When you get stomped because you suck...  
LOOOOOL  
...or you just lose because you suck...  
Like, "Ah.. I just got stomped."  
But then when you lose by just one tick...  
That messes with your mental.  
It makes you lose your calm.  
Makes you play more aggressively.  
Makes you hate the whole world.  
Can’t I just take one more minion?  
Just one more?  
Yummy.  
Good.  
Nice~  
Ok~  
Akali! This is your last chance...  
Are you gonna stop me?  
You don’t wanna, right?  
LOOOOOL  
If I back now,  
you’ll never be able to stop me.  
It’s your last chance!  
Sorry.  
Ah...  
Wait... what if they actually take that chance?  
Even if Shaco shows up...  
I think it'll be fine?  
Shaco’s heading bot?  
Good.  
Nice~  
Yes~  
But there are way too many one-sided games these days, right?  
Guess it can’t be helped.  
GG.
