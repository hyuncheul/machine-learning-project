well then let's get started tonight a
swarm of zombies will rise up and attack
so we're going to reinforce this house
with anti-zombie security measures a
swarm of zombies we need a security
system hurry JJ for today our plan is to
protect this house by using 10 different
security systems 10 security systems to
kick things off we're going to use lava
lava is super useful it's the simplest
most effective security system there is
we just have to dig a mode around the
house like this then fill it up all
right it's digging time oh I see
okay nice let's split up to dig faster
yeah sure just like
this great wow protective lava is a
really good idea yep simple and
effective that's lava for you it rocks
amazing there that looks good
oh there we go all right that does it
for the digging now all we need to do is
pour in the lava okay go go go it's
pretty simple simple but powerful no one
can get close right no one will be able
to reach us we're ready for anything wow
impressive nice that should take care of
most of the zombies they'll be driven
off yeah this is
perfect okay okay that's probably good
enough enough awesome it's good enough
we're all done our protective lava is
complete next are the snow golem turrets
Snow Golem turrets what are those you'll
see Mikey you'll see first we need to
build a few Towers to hold our snow
golems in maybe we can build them with
stone bricks like these now then we just
need to add some trap doors trap
doors next we'll add in some snow and
finally a carv pumpkin now it's time to
put everything together
wo there's a specific way to put on the
trap doors like this nice and some more
trap doors will go up here
oh then you just carve out the middle of
your
Tower huh that looks strong now you can
summon tons of snow golems that's
awesome see this interesting I want to
try it too h
[Music]
it can hold quite a few
[Music]
Golems finished our snow golem turret
now you try sure I think that's
right like this oh I get
it and now
yeah lay down the
blocks like that oh okay it's hard to
place the blocks in the air so try to
crouch when you do it that'll make it
easier all right the impressive thing
about snow golem turrets is that they
throw snowballs when they see enemies
awesome so with this many snow golems
they'll bombard the zombies with their
snowballs unfortunately snowballs don't
do any damage they're going to fight for
us though yep they fight for you so it's
really powerful they can hold off
anything I guess that means our snow
golem turrets are finished now then
Mikey number three a secret entrance
secret entrance yep basically it's just
like a basement huh
check it out wa H if we want to fight
the zombies we'll need to use this
basement effectively I'd like to be able
to go straight into the basement from
the outside that's why we're installing
a secret entrance it's probably a good
idea to build it outside of the moat
this area looks good let's start
building our secret entrance around here
I think that maybe I'll turn this
section here into a
staircase keep on digging oh I'll help
this should be deep enough
nice I'll keep going
ahead all right now for the actual
stairs
awesome nice this passage here yeah
let's connect it to the basement hook it
up over here if I count it correctly it
should line up perfectly W check it out
it worked amazing perfect now then we
have haven't made this entrance a secret
yet that's true we haven't hidden it yet
let's do that right now the most
important things we need are sticky
pistons then we need some redstone dust
and
repeaters I'll just clear this
[Music]
out that's
perfect now we can put these in here
awesome there we go what's next oh yeah
now we need to attach some repeaters to
this Tock keep Pistons here's the first
one M the second one goes on the second
slot
oh H great next up
interesting that's how you set it
up nice then you just connect it with
the Redstone like this oh
[Music]
looking
good there just like that good job now
to use the Redstone
Dust yeah and then you're ready ready
ready
then we can have the lever right
here okay just pull
it huh the last one didn't activate I
should reinforce the signal with more
repeaters good
idea
okay it works oh now what it works now
we just attach grass blocks to cover all
these sticky pistons
wow like this that was incredible
watch this
oh we just cover the rest yep wow
impressive huh I think there's something
not quite right about these three
okay perfect now everything is working
correctly wonderful now then we just
have to make the Redstone circuit
undetectable all right like this just
like
that nice nice just lay it down and hide
everything from sight okay can't forget
this
spot awesome oh it works yeah it's
amazing you can walk right in wow we
still need to make a lever so we can
open it from the inside too let's do
it makes sense how are you going to add
it to the inside of the
tunnel I just have to lay down some
redstone on the inside as well
h a lever will probably do the trick
amazing wo sweet W it's finished it
closed perfectly that's the best
security mhm there our secret entrance
is done all finished this was our third
security system now we can get into the
house using the secret entrance but
Mikey in the unlikely event that our
secret entrance is exposed
security system 4 can be fire charged
turrets that sounds strong to make fire
charged turrets we'll need all of the
following items dispensers redstone
comparators redstone dust and levers and
I can't forget to mention Fire charges
with all that I think it would make
sense for the first fire charged turret
to go somewhere around
here then the second one here plus we'll
need a way to watch over the Invaders so
we'll have to build ourselves some
stairs
this will raise us high
enough all right now then oh thanks
Mikey we need to put the fire charges
inside the dispensers in that case I'll
put more
in next I'll need to break some blocks
and open up some space along the walls
here like this bust up the walls what's
next next we need to install the lever
oh there here's the Redstone
comparator oh now we connect it with
redstone dust
wow like
this I'll put this
here that's good enough for
now nice M I think this should work
impressive let's try wow this is amazing
so powerful W all done I I have a pretty
good feeling there won't be any zombies
who make it through this hallway there's
no way now to patch up the walls you can
kind of camouflage it like this great
yep still works maybe I'll raise this up
a
level okay oh nice it's amazing flawless
I guess that means our fire charge
turrets are
complete all right Mikey if we're going
to fight zombies then we'll need to arm
ourselves there's really no other way to
survive H what did you have in mind well
when the zombies attack it'll take a lot
of time to equip all the armors and
weapons especially if it's one piece at
a time we should make an automatic
equipment system to do it all at once
what is that actually a thing it is
let's build it what kind of items will
we need well for starters we'll
definitely need dispensers and some
Redstone Dust M oh yeah and a button
first things first we need to set up two
dispensers on each wall like this once
those are finished we should build one
into the floor too we need to have
another dispenser that goes above your
head then we need some Redstone Dust
down here and we can put the button
somewhere on the side there that's it
that's it yep huh what's that for let's
make one for you just for Mikey let's
see like
that then we'll add one on the
ground there done now you just need to
choose the six things you want from it
in my case maybe I'll go with the
netherite netherite armor and a
netherite sword 1 2 3 4 5 I need one
more item I'll go with a golden apple
nice choice now I just have to fill it
up Swords there we go I chose all mine
all
right okay finished when the zombies
attack we can just run in here all we
have to do is press the button and we'll
be fully equipped in no time wow amazing
let's try it out later sounds good time
for measure six I want to build a zombie
capture device we could probably use the
captured zombies for science yeah we'll
use this hole to trap
them let's build it
here yeah somewhere here sure now then
Mikey we need to cover the hole with
four trap doors placed like
[Music]
this right
here right here the next step is to
surround the whole thing with redstone
dust
okay all
[Music]
right next we need to send a signal from
down below we can build it vertically
like
this just like
that great I think that's done
now
perfect it just needed a
lever look amazing when you flip the
lever they fall in the hole we'll
capture all the zombies wandering around
above us H if we lead them to the trap
on purpose we can intentionally push
them in and capture them down here I see
it now wow I guess I need to build a
cage yeah you do let's see here we could
build it with a stone fence like
this yep like this
just like that nice yeah you got
[Music]
it iron bars all right these iron bars a
cell wo these iron bars turned it into a
jail
cell oh wow
amazing this is great we can take out
the zombies that fall in the the
hole Yeah and use them as our research
subjects good idea it's a great trap wo
it's closed now I feel so safe Security
System complete next is number seven a
self-destruct mechanism
self-destruct why would we do that if
there are too many zombies for us to
handle or if they're about to take over
the house Our Last Resort will be to
blow the entire place up huh come up
here coming blowing up the house is
crazy I was thinking we could build it
up on the roof on the roof yep first we
need to spread some dispensers around
evenly along the ceiling just like this
you got it
yeah is this right
hm check it out the dispensers are going
to go in above these
holes okay it's dangerous to load them
with TNT so for now let's just load them
with redstone dust we can always just
switch it out later when the zombies
come
now to add the redstone
dust that's all of them
yep next we'll connect everything
through a redstone comparator so the
mechanism should look a little something
like
this all
[Music]
right hang
on place these one at a time
oh no I let the lava in I fixed
it now then
yeah place blocks in every other spot
like
this sure now the next step is to place
down a single redstone torch on every
block that way the signal will travel to
the top M and then comes the lever
maybe I'll switch this block like
this maybe
not what's going on just flip this
switch whenever you want to turn it on
or
off okay sure this is probably turned
off but we should keep it like that for
now we'll just make sure it stays closed
off
ahuh just like that if you switch the
lever on it'll activate the
self-destruct mechanism so I'd like to
keep it nice and
secure I think that should do the trick
we'll leave the lever behind a red
stained glass pane if we need to access
the lever we can just smash the
[Music]
glass and switch it on
okay there all right Mikey flip the
lever so I can make sure that it's
working sure let's see 3 2 1 now huh W
check it out it's raining Redstone Dust
if it were real that would all be TNT
it's super dangerous you can say that
again there's no going back from that so
we have to be extra careful I'll be
extra careful I'll put the TNT in now
now it's time for measure number eight
the secret escape hatch secret escape
hatch when we activate the self-destruct
mechanism we'll need to make a quick
Escape or else true we need a plan for
when that happens like a secret escape
hatch h
we have to make a break for it and flee
from The Hideout that sounds great it's
good just in case we need it yeah that's
a good
[Music]
point for the escape hatch it's a secret
so maybe we should hide it with moss and
stuff there's a bunch of items like that
we can use to disguise it so no one else
can get in we'll use Moss blocks and
Moss what are those for we'll put it
right next to the self-destruct
mechanism nice
[Music]
right here oh use the
Moss hang
on there first use a shovel to make a
dirt block path then after that lay out
a piece of moss carpet on
top
mhm all right the most important part
actually goes behind the blocks of moss
right here sure attach a lever here
right behind the block there that's
perfect oh then put some more Moss
blocks on top that's probably good for
now what is it well take off the Moss
carpet huh now you can see the lever
through here no way you can actually oh
reach the lever you can amazing yeah no
one will know it's there yep this is for
our secret escape hatch so it needs to
be secret from everyone yeah let's keep
it a big secret we need to put a
repeater here mm and some Redstone Dust
right now it's finally time to dig the
hole for the secret escape hatch
somewhere around
here w h okay what's
next oh I get it fill it all in
okay wo then if you knock the Moss
carpet off uh-huh you can hit the lever
and jump down here that's the eighth
security measure the secret escape hatch
no one will ever find it who would even
think about looking back there let's
keep
going number nine the underwater getaway
Railway the ocean is actually on the
other side of here really the ocean
let's go dig to the ocean
I never realized it but I guess our
house has an ocean view see woo Eureka
wow the ocean this means we have an
Escape Route that goes right into the
ocean as for our mode of transportation
I was thinking we could build a secret
Railway I like that idea let's start by
getting the rails ready we'll need
enough for two people the water keeps on
pushing me back JJ in times like these
use signs signs just like this oh I
think have to remove them later though
so there's enough space to build the
railway this is much better let's clear
this all right now it's time to lay the
first
rails yeah let's lay them down we can
use redstone blocks under the actual
rails for a power
[Music]
source
H then we can place powered rails on top
[Music]
H one here make another Railway that way
there's one for each of us sounds
good okay we should hurry now
then huh time to place the buttons
here an ordinary
[Music]
rail now because the rails were updated
to work
underwater what really let's add rails
all the way to the ocean yeah more
rails wo it works let's keep going just
like this like
this oh I see
nice
[Music]
awesome we don't want to drown in the
mine carts so this is far enough yeah
you're right it doesn't matter that the
rails work underwater if we have no air
to breathe finally Mikey what is it the
tth
security an underwater shelter an
underwater shelter sounds tricky since
zombies only go on land we can hide in
the ocean where they won't be able to
get us we'll just stay underwater all
night long until the sun comes up in the
morning and takes care of the remaining
zombies for us it'll be the ultimate
last ditch emergency underwater
shelter it doesn't need to be that big
since it's pretty much just a panic room
all right how's this nice that's good
enough we're almost done I guess it
could be a block wider okay our security
is almost ready to
go that's awesome I can't wait nice cool
cool
[Music]
cool like this
[Music]
m we we need an entrance for the
rails
yep I'm going to connect the
rails all
right
[Music]
almost
perfect now for the
[Music]
rails let's
hurry h
[Music]
oh thanks there it's all finished but
it's still full of water I guess it's
not all finished the shelter's flooded
that's what I was saying in that case we
can set up signs to prevent the water
from flooding back in
then we can use sponges to absorb all
the leftover water inside that should do
the trick nice nice nice now all the
water's gone we finished yep we just
need to add a few things like a crafting
table maybe a furnace and a couple of
beds
too we should have some food oh
definitely now I'll just put down the
beds okay nice I think we're done for
real this time we're done woah this is
really something now we just need to
wait for the zombies let's
[Music]
go they're here uh-oh it looks like a
lot of zombies spawned so many this
isn't good oh no let's go back I think
they see me hurry who will the snow
golems fight hang on there's a swarm of
baby zombies chasing me run bring it on
Snow Golems stop the baby zombies for me
cross the lava
Mode come on JJ right the lava nice are
we safe why aren't the Snow Golems
fighting they're definitely fighting
they're knocking the zombies
in wow great security it's time to run
come on get inside oh this is really bad
I'm opening it the secret entrance there
nice let's go hurry shut it uh-oh some
of them got in they're inside here they
come let's try this out this is bad fire
charges it's so strong that worked
pretty well wow that's super powerful
yeah I can't believe it so effective are
there more breaking in I think you might
be right the fire charges won't last
there are way more zombies getting
inside more it'll be fine what how we
still have more security oh yeah okay
let's see
here click yes me too it's my turn now
do it it's my turn now I'm eating the
golden apple oh nice transformation
Mikey close one wo NE the right armor is
the best Mikey do you think it's about
time we tried out the zombie capture
device oh I forgot about that one quick
pull the lever will this even work okay
3 2
1 so many that's amazing great trap wo
there's too many let's take them out JJ
wow incredible look they're all riled up
well it is zombie horde day today yes
finished awesome we did it good job our
dirty rocks uh Mikey this is bad the
zombie horde is getting in they are this
is terrible How can there be this many
of them oh well at least we're still
safe for the time
being uh-oh uh this one's out of fire
charges no way hang on Mikey hurry uh
come over here
quick here they're breaking in get in
the hatch they're coming for us that
isn't good uh-oh
Mikey what now we have to run for it I'm
pulling the lever get it oh no no no no
no hurry hurry oh no hop on W I think I
hear the
explosions
crazy W what the we're on the Escape
mine cart so we should be safe
safe you hear that the explosions well
we're in our Ultra secure underwater
shelter now so we'll just have to wait
it out until morning sounds good yep I'm
glad we made it yeah me too that means
our 10 security measures protected us
