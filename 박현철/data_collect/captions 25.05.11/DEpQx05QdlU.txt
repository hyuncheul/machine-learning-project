What's up, Switch fans? Welcome back to
Switchtop. Today, we're talking about
the most exciting games coming to
Nintendo Switch in 2025. These are the
games you'll want to keep an eye on and
maybe even save up for. Let's jump right
into our countdown of the top 25
upcoming Switch games that have us super
hyped for next year. Hades 2 puts you in
the shoes of Melaninoi, the princess of
the underworld, and sister of Zagreas
from the first game. This time you're a
witch on a mission to take down the
Titan of Time who's imprisoned the god
Hades. Just like the first game, when
you die, you go back to your home base
where you can upgrade abilities, talk to
characters, and learn more about the
story before trying again. The combat is
still fast and fluid with new weapons,
magic spells, and gods giving you
powers. The big new addition is a
witchcraft system where you gather
ingredients during runs to brew potions
and spells at a cauldron. You'll also
visit totally new realms beyond the
underworld with fresh enemies and
bosses. If you love the first Hades,
this sequel looks like it keeps
everything great while adding cool new
stuff to discover.
But you and I have a shared purpose.

Looks pretty comfy. Not that I would
know. Oh, dang.
Don't be afraid. Good girl, Hecuba.
Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD 2D remake brings
the first two games in this legendary
RPG series to life with a beautiful new
look. These games from the 1980s have
been completely rebuilt with the same HD
2D style that made Octopath Traveler and
Triangle Strategy look so cool. It's
like playing with fancy 3D environments,
but charming 2D pixel characters. The
story in the first game has you playing
as a hero descended from a legendary
warrior setting out to defeat the evil
dragon lord who's terrorizing the land
of Alfgard. The second game happens 100
years later when you play as the first
hero's grandkid taking on a new villain.
The gameplay keeps the turnbased battles
these games are known for, but with
modern touches like better menus, faster
combat, and quality of life
improvements, so you don't have to deal
with the old school frustrations. It's
the perfect way to experience where the
JRPG genre began without struggling
through dated mechanics.
Hollow Knight. Silkong puts you in
control of Hornet, the nimble princess
protector who was a boss and ally in the
first game. After being captured and
taken to a new kingdom called Faroom,
Hornet must fight her way upward through
this strange world to reach its shining
citadel at the top. Unlike the knight
from the first game, Hornet is faster
and more acrobatic. She can sprint, leap
higher, and uses silk to swing across
gaps. Her combat style is completely
different, too, using her needle and
thread for quick, deadly strikes and
traps. Instead of soul, Hornet builds up
silk by fighting enemies, which she can
use to heal or craft tools and traps.
The game has over 150 new enemies and
bosses, each with unique patterns to
learn. What's really cool is that when
you beat the game, you unlock Silk Soul
mode, which changes the game for a
totally different second playthrough
experience.

Ninja Gaiden Ragebound brings the
legendary action series back with a
fresh start that both newcomers and
longtime fans can enjoy. You play as Ryu
Hayabusa, Master Ninja in a new
adventure where an ancient curse is
spreading across the world. The game
keeps the series super fast combat where
timing is everything. You'll slice
through enemies with your dragon sword,
use special ninja abilities, and pull
off spectacular finishing moves. What
makes this version special is the new
rage system. As you build up a meter in
combat, you can enter rage mode, where
time slows down and your attacks become
more powerful and flashy. The big
improvement over older games is that
while it's still challenging, it has
different difficulty options, so
everyone can have fun without hitting
frustrating walls. The game has eight
huge levels with multiple paths to
explore, hidden items to find, and
monstrous bosses waiting at the end of
each area.

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond continues Samus
Aaron's firstperson adventure series
after a very long wait. This time, Samus
investigates a distress signal from a
research station on the edge of known
space, where scientists were studying
ancient alien technology that might be
connected to the Choso, the bird-like
race that raised her. The game keeps the
exploration focused gameplay the series
is known for. You view the world through
Samus' visor, scanning objects to learn
about them, solving environmental
puzzles, and finding new abilities that
let you access previously blocked areas.
The big new mechanic is the phase shift
system, where Samus can temporarily
shift between different dimensions to
solve puzzles and find secret paths.
Your arm cannon has new beam types for
combat, and the grapple beam has been
expanded with more movement and puzzle
solving uses.
As she explores the planet, Samus is
granted mysterious and ancient
powers, psychic abilities.
Pokemon Legends Zday takes the open zone
exploration from Legends Arus and brings
it to Lumio's city from Pokemon X and Y,
but in a different time period when the
city is being built. As a Pokemon
architect and trainer, your job is to
help design different districts of the
city while solving the mystery of
strange energy readings and Pokémon
behavior changes. The battles keep the
actionoriented system from Legends Arus
where you can catch Pokemon without
fighting them, but adds new urban themed
catching mechanics like luring Pokémon
with city specific items. The game
introduces mega evolution as a key story
element with you researching how this
power connects to the city's history. A
cool new feature is the habitat creator
where you can design parks and natural
spaces throughout the city to attract
different types of Pokémon.

2D action platformer that looks like a
playable steampunk anime. You play as
Athea, a skilled mercenary with a
mysterious past in the steamowered city
of Kanan, where strange supernatural
events are happening that connect to an
industrial accident years ago. The
gameplay is like a mix between
Castlevania and a character action game.

enemies, a pistol for ranged attacks,
and special steam-powered abilities you
unlock throughout the game. What makes
it stand out is the RPG elements. You'll
talk to characters, make choices and
conversations that affect the story, and
take on side quests from the city's
residents. The upgrade system lets you

prefer close combat, ranged attacks, or
using gadgets.

American Arcadia is one of the most
unique games coming to Switch where you
discover you're actually living in a

play as Trevor, an average guy living in
a retrofuturistic city who discovers his
entire life has been entertainment for
viewers. And now his ratings are down,
meaning he'll be eliminated. The game

take on the formula. You arrive in a
once beautiful valley that's now stuck
in eternal winter, and it's up to you to
