Hold me close 'til I get up
내가 일어날 때까지 나를 가까이 안아줘 
Time is barely on our side
시간은 겨우 우리 편이야 
I don't wanna waste what's left
남은 걸 낭비하고 싶지 않아 
The storms we chase are leading us
우리가 쫓는 폭풍우가 우리를 이끌고 있어 
And love is all we'll ever trust, yeah
그리고 사랑만이 우리가 믿을 수 있는 전부야 
I don't wanna waste what's left
남은 걸 낭비하고 싶지 않아
And on and on we'll go
그리고 우리는 계속 갈거야
