Welcome back to the LC. I hope you
enjoyed your little tour through the
Ionian rift. It was very peaceful. I
hated it. Okay, nobody asked. Anyway,
I'm Jen and today I am joined with
Namara and Odo to dissect everything
that is happening on the LEC because you
know what? One more week for playoffs.
So,
yay. Was that great? Did you enjoy it? I
enjoyed a I feel like, you know, as
someone who's not been playing as much
ranked recently and stuff, I feel like I
can enjoy I can enjoy the tranquility of
the rift without realizing that people
will still type to you exactly the same
way. said tranquility and his eyebrows
just went. Yeah, I installed my eyes
because see the thing is the video was
peaceful up until you get into rank game
and someone's just ining you and then
you're you remember yeah I can't help
you with that one buddy. What if you're
that someone? Oh sometime most of the
time it's me but I'm just you know
coping and projecting on others. So we
love a self-aware king but let's talk
about today specifically. We do have to
acknowledge the fact that momentum
really is something that is going to
change a team split in either a good or
a bad way. So, let's start off with the
rankings specifically because I mean we
love hammering home on G2 being 33, but
like Vitality is there too. BDS joined
it. And I think particularly when we
look at like this clumping, there's a
bunch in the middle where we still have
no idea where they're going to end up in
terms of final rank, whether they'll
make playoffs at all. And all of the
teams playing today, microscope starts
to get put onto them. Exactly. But hate
watchers galore, G2 Esports is three and
three. It's maybe the first time in a
really long time where they might
actually have a shot at missing
playoffs, you know. And we also made a
completely arbitrary graphic that shows
you the split trajectories of the four
teams that we're going to be looking at
today with series played being on the x-
axis and the games won on the y axis cuz
I mean Madrid the arena debuff for G2
because like what?
Yeah. Yeah. Um so there's a lot of lines
here we have to go for. We have four
teams here. There's G2, Vitality, BDS,
and GX. The lines going up and down are
the games and series one. So it's games
uh um the game score is really important
here. And then this is like the timeline
of the split. And all of these look
really really different. Um but the
great thing about showing like this is
that you can see some really good
turning points. So we have like you know
the peak of Mount G2 up there which is
one night error and a bit tall. And we
also have stuff like the trough of the
Mariana Trench Vitality Downfall which
is one nightmare. On scale you're like
196. I'm 195. Well we'll be being okay.
a little bit. Okay. But on the trend of,
you know, just highlighting the fact
that Vitality is the only team that's
been having such a huge, you know,
downward slope. They're also the only
team in the recent time that strung
together two wins in a row. Everyone is
inconsistent as hell. Everyone's going
up and down. Even BDS, they're finding
themselves. They won against G2 here,
right? This is the time where they won
and now they're about to chain two wins
in a row. Yay. And then the 17k, no 13k
incident happened. And look where they
are now. Complete. wiped that from my
memory. Well, I did it cuz I enjoyed it.
You know, I'm just a hate watcher
nowadays. So, like bring it back to like
everything here. We see a huge amount of
turning points. We see a lot of our
teams converging towards the middle, but
I think even then there's some other
things we could dive into. Turning
points across the board. GX is the last
team that we haven't really talked about
in terms of the ups and downs here. I
want to just focus on the road trip here
because this looks kind of bad cuz
they're down here. They could be well
further below. I actually think GX this
is a little bit hidden here. The little
bits of up and down here is way better
than I think a lot of people gave them
maybe hope for earlier into it. So you
have four teams with really different
trajectories. And when I when you look
at G2, you would think that that throw
trip was the time for them to finally
make this comeback because this is
usually G2's playing ground, you know,
going to well land events because I'm a
I'm a boomer like that, you know, but
going to land events, that's the time
where they usually come alive and they
have the best performances. But right
now, ooh, now they find themselves
struggling, you know. I look at this, I
look at the standings, all I can think
is what the hell. But since we have not
talked enough about the road trip
specifically and its implications, let's
take a look at KC making their way to
Ivory or Avery.
[Music]
Okay, we arrived. What do you mean we've
arrived? This is not every and are not
the same place. You know, we are in the
wrong one.
Every Paris, where are we?
There's been a classic map reading
issue. No worries, it's part of the
process. Take it as a learning
experience.
Okay. So, what do we do? Great question.
What will you do?
[Music]
Take it as a learning experience. snow.
Sounds like a great approach, but I feel
like time is ticking for both of these
teams because BDS going up against GX.
BDS winning this Rogue and GX are going
to be fully eliminated. You like this is
a crazy position to be in. You're coming
in, you're playing your game straight
after that arena where you had so much
on the line. You won, you made your fans
proud, and now it's like, oops, we can
be going home. Yeah, it's it's not
looking pretty because even though GX I
feel like had um as Namira said that
they had a pretty okay week turning it
around in uh in Madrid, it might be a
little bit too too little too late
because now they're finding themselves
with I think one or two series left.
Next week we're going to see them on the
last day of the split. But right now
their destiny is not really in their
hands. They need to clutch both of these
wins to just have a shot at tiebreaker.
And then on the flip side we have GX.
And if they win, then BDS is going to
need a tiebreaker to qualify, which is
also like unimaginable because BDS used
to be the gatekeepers. They were top
three all of last year. I think a lot of
people have now kind of said it in their
head that they are a top team within the
LEC. They might not even be in playoffs.
So, both of these teams, I think, um, we
can go back to, you know, the
trajectories we were talking about over
there. Feels like they're a little bit
different to now what I've got set in my
head. GX is quite far far below the bar,
but I feel like they're better than that
record suggest. And BDS, they're in
trouble streets. They are, but I don't
know. It's kind of as you said with BDS,
you would expect a little bit more for
them. I still have faith in them even
though they've been so damning
consistent going up and down, left and
right.
I thought you were a hate watcher. Now
you just sound like Well, so the thing
is you can't hate on everyone, right? I
have my favorite. You got to select a
few. Yeah, cuz are a little bit victims,
you know, the fall from grace. I I'm I'm
It's tragedy like that, you know, but
I'm all I'm all up for that. But at the
same time, on the other side, you also
have heretics, so you can't I'm I'm a
big fan there. Right. Well, earlier
Shocks did have the chance to sit down
with Striker to talk about BDS,
specifically their performance, their
search for identity, and I guess what
Odo said, them being
victims. Welcome to the Marriott Bonvoy
pregame check-in. I'm here with BDS's
coach striker ahead of an allimportant
clash versus GX in terms of the
standings. But I I think you will
understand that I would love to start
with yesterday. Uh cuz I feel like this
is one of the examples of seeing how
good BDS can be, but then also what the
things are you kind of fall to a lot as
well. Is that your same read? Yeah, I
think uh what people see is what we are,
right? I think we're a team that can get
lead, get to decent spots in mid to late
game. Um and then when it comes to the
important moments uh we we may struggle
a bit. I think uh yesterday I'm not sure
also in their base we didn't quite uh
finish the game when we should. Uh
hopefully today will be different. We
did review we did prepare a bit more. So
hopefully today will be different here.
Is that something you can contextualize
and that a fanatic is kind of coming off
such a high from being in Madrid that
know how to play these situations
expertly or would did you really say no
it was really our fault and something
that you know we can rectify? Oh we try
to focus on ourselves obviously because
if you go that way you could also say
that that you just won in a big arena
then you have much time to scream as
well so they should be weaker than what
they are. So you can take it either way.
What we have to do is focus on ourselves
and uh today we have to take the
learnings from the previous match
against Fnatic to make sure that we beat
GX. Yeah, it's all a me a matter of
perspective. Of course you said it. It's
up versus GX. There's a lot going on
here. Um if you do manage to win, you
will knock out GX and Ro, but you will
still probably have to play a
tiebreaker. There's a lot. I I always
wonder because we as a broadcast we h we
hammer on that a lot but do you think
about all those scenarios or do you talk
about it as a team or can you really
just say well it's win or bust? Uh I
mean you do because you you want to know
it then when it comes to the preparation
you just go one one match at a time. Uh
you make sure that you put your best
chance in every single game, every
single draft and that's that's what you
do here. Yeah. Speaking of drafts, um I
feel like we saw from BDS throughout
this year kind of different approaches.
I mean, when it comes to just the top
lane, for instance, you have sometimes
carry tops, sometimes tank tops,
sometimes compositions that play to
that, sometimes not. Would you feel like
you're still kind of looking for your
identity or you've been testing out a
lot or or is that a wrong um obser
observation to make? I think we we have
different roles in the team that can be
filled by different players. Uh what we
try to do especially with fearless is be
adaptative based on how we approach
teams. I think a lot of teams have a
strong identity and we try to maneuver
around that. Sometimes we pick a
champion and then we drop it simply
because I don't like how it looks on
stage. Sometimes uh the patch makes you
want to play also different. Um so those
are all things that we take into account
when we do different preparations. Okay.
How does uh Nuke fit into all this?
because I know in the beginning of the
year we talked about how he is taking up
a big mantle of being uh more of the
captain who can be you know can have
show very different things in games but
also outside of the game. How do you
think he's evolving in that way? I think
he's evolving into the the linder he
should be and he's meant to be. I think
that uh if it was not for him or maybe
our playoff chances would be uh slimmer
than what they already uh so I think
that he did feel his role in a in a very
important manner both in game and
outside of game and yeah he's leading
the game inside the game. He's the one
that make sure that our macro is
um correct and at the same time he has
great individual performance which is
important for us as well. Yeah, it's
been great to watch for sure. Thank you
for your candid answers and good luck.
Thank you guys. I mean, high words of
praise for Nuke specifically and that is
also I mean he said it himself like if
it wasn't for Nuke's performances, the
playoff chances might not be where they
are today. I agree with the with pretty
much everything that he said because I
feel like Nuke is the well no I don't
feel like he is the only player that's
that's still here from the previous uh
BDS iteration. And when I look at BDS,
if it wasn't for him, they would be
struggling a little bit more. But my
main concern for BDS is the fact that
they're trying all of these things. It
feels like if they would have a little
bit more stability, more wins, more
time, they could be able to pull off all
of these things left and right. But
right now, I really feel like they're
just over cooking a little bit. The bit
where they're not cooking though, cuz I
agree with the rest of the map. That's
true. Look, we've got the mid laners
highlighted behind us. Nuke on one side
and then Jackie's on the other. I think
it's a great way to tie both of these
teams together because I think the part
of BDS's identity they have set is Nuke
long range DPS. He has not played a
single melee mid this split. He has
incredible um KDA and his damage is
really good too. It definitely feels
like Nuke is core with the champions
that he's picking and I think that's
really good to then put that over to the
other side of GX where Jackie's um I
feel like he has been not so great in
the lane but he has been skirmishing and
playing later on effectively. Exactly.
And I feel like it's an interesting
clash of styles where you look at Nuke
and you, as you said, he only plays
these sort of control mages, pretty much
keeping the game stable, pretty much
just sitting behind, playing front to
backs, dishing out a lot of damage.
While on the other side, Jackie is it
really feels like if you look at his
laning phase stats, they're not really
they're not really great. He's
struggling, but come mid game, come late
game, that's when he becomes unleashed
as as a as a playmaker, I would think,
cuz that's that's the style when I look
at Jackie. This is where he thrives the
most. I think also really interestingly
for Jackie is something that we talked
about a lot is the fact that he does
also get caught on the side lanes and I
feel like when you're looking at nuke
especially when he's playing that
Tristana or or it's the Azir or whatever
it might be if he is on that side lane
he does manage to get towers he does
manage to play it safe and the team is
also I guess a little bit more set up
around him to be able to shadow in case
something does go wrong. Yeah. No, I
think Nuke Nuke is the bit of the game
which I think is going right for them
and I think that's the bit which I think
they could say let's let's leave well
alone. We're sorted with that. I'm more
interested then outside of that to say
okay that bit you've nailed in place.
What else can you do with the rest of
the players? Well, we had 113 step up
because previously when we were thinking
of 113, we always said, "Oh, he's ining
early mid game, you know, he's doing a
lot of chaotic stuff. It doesn't really
end up working." But right now, when I
think of 113, he evolved into being this
consistent rock in the team. But the
problem is when you look at Midame, if
he falls behind, I don't see him coming
back and making consistently good plays.
All right. Well, let's figure out how
exactly this matchup in the mid lane is
going to be playing out today as we're
ready to head into our first game of
Sunday BDS going up against GX. So
casters, take it away.
Away it has been taken. I'm medic. I'm
joined by Betty and we're here for the
first series of today. That's the
English are going to open with away it
has been taken. Taking it away. Away it
has been taken.
All right, let us see how far away we'll
fly away together as we jump on the way.
Away. That's Freaky Friday, isn't it?
Uh, yeah. Freaky Friday movie. Great
movie. Classic. Now, while we're having
fun and games here on the caster desk,
it's a super Sunday. It is a It's also a
very serious Sunday for both these
teams. A lot on the line for Giant X as
a loss here will remove them from
playoffs contention. They had a super
exciting weekend last weekend over in
Madrid where they were able to defeat
Fnatic and they were able to get a um
they defeated
G2 and they lost to Mcoy. So they uh and
it was a super close series with Mcoy as
well. So expectations have grown with
the roster. I think Lot in particular
had a very standout series and I'm
excited to see what they've prepared for
us today after BDS find themselves
coming off a loss against Fnatic
yesterday in a much needed win for
themselves to keep their playoffs hopes
alive. Yeah, for BDS really you need to
win this series. There are still ways
they can make it through via tiebreers
if they do lose against Giant X. As you
said, if GX lose this series, they are
out and they will join Rogue as our
teams are being
eliminated. So, Jace ban, Maai ban, Yona
ban, and Niti ban so far.
Betty, nothing too exciting. The Niti
obviously have seen Ismo bring it out a
couple of times. Azia, Tia, Rumble are
all the champions we're thinking about
as being high priorities. Zen Xiao for
113 makes a lot of sense. Even though he
didn't win with it yesterday, I still
think it's a champion you can't afford
to give him. It is his most played so
far this split and it's something that
you can find a lot of great snap engages
on. Rumble is available for BDS.
Something they prioritized yesterday in
game one. It's going to be the Vas
straight away. Still a very powerful AD
car. We've seen Noah bring it out a
couple of times so far this split. About
50/50 in the win rate on that one. BDS
now. You can go for AD carry early, but
jungle mid also makes a lot of sense if
you want something that can just team
fight well. Noturn Oriana does that
pretty well and Oriana was slightly
buffed on this patch. Are they thinking
of doing the run back yesterday, they
had some really nice one shots onto
upset, but then as they got later into
the game, their target selection ended
up being their undoing cuz if they
weren't killing upset, Upset was killing
them. And so we'll see how things shift
as they move into into today's series.
The nocturn already locked in as you
highlighted. I mean it's not Corana,
isn't it? It does feel like it. If you
pick the Noctturn, you then kind of have
to pick the Oriana cuz otherwise Giant X
could just say, "Oh, we'll just play
Orian mid ourselves. She's strong enough
at the moment that I think that is
fine." Uh it is Knock Oriana. I'd like
to see them have one more damage threat
alongside their AD carry here. Yesterday
we saw uh it was if the Varys got
killed, I was on Bars in that game. If
the Varys got killed and they didn't
burst upset immediately, they just
didn't have enough damage to win out the
team fight in the end, right? So, I'd
like another damage threat from the top
lane. We'll see where BDS do end up
going wherement decides he wants to play
today. Giant Tech looking towards an AP
top and Rumble often the first name on
everyone's lips. 15 and four in the LEC
is the little yodel. Good top laner.
Is he good or is he just really strong?
Uh well that does that make him good
with one another? Are they not? Yeah,
you're right. You're right. You're
right. Okay, GX looks like they're
keeping it simple. Scar going to make
his way into Isma's hands. So already
we're looking at more of a frontto back
style composition with solid backline
threat thanks to the Rumble. You know, I
was thinking for BDS that Rumble is
something they should have considered
like Noctturn Oriana. Rumble, huge
amount of backline threats can cause a
huge amount of chaos, but they decided
to prioritize getting that mid lane
champion. Now, how are they going to
round things out? Nah, I mean, it is
irrelevant to most played so far this
split and I can see the potential. It
gives you a decent laning phase into the
Rumble at the very least, but in terms
of what they want the composition to do,
I don't know if I love it. Guess you
could argue that there is that degree of
sidelane threat that it does provide.
You do still have the ability to create
alternative wombo combos with the
ultimate as well. But so far, I think
that I'm favoring GX's foundation a
little bit more just cuz you expect them
to have a winning bot side simply
because they have the virus. The Rumble
on the top side has great early to mid
game power with a lot of strong scaling
elements and they've already got such a
solid front line with the Scanner. just
feels like as a baseline composition. It
provides a lot of solid tools. Yeah, I
agree with that overall and Giant X have
the opportunity to ban out some of those
AD carries now as well, having already
locked theirs in. BDS are going to
remove some of Jackie's mid lane pool. I
do think he had a good time in Madrid as
well. Had a couple of really strong pop
off games on uh the Yon I remember in
particular. Obviously, it's already
banned out here, so not going to see him
piloting that one. Will maybe want to
look for some AD out of the mid lane.
Tristano is the next option up there,
but he can still go AP mid. You have a
bit of an AP heavy top side, but you
still have the Varys to carry you
through later on. I will say the Ezreal
ban is a little surprising only because
Ice hasn't actually played it once this
split. He's actually had a preference
for the Jin and the Ash with a bit of
Civer in there as well. Zer is one of
the scaling AD carries that when you say
you want more damage, this champion
definitely provides it. rough laning
phase though uh against the far
specifically it will largely depend on
what yeah I was so gives you a better
laning phase of course a lot of this
will be determined based on the support
match up and I think BDS is smart
actually saving that for the last pick
just because it means that you can
alleviate some of the pressure from the
varus right now GX I'm sure would love a
little bit more
engage used to be a fantastic answer
into Oriana I would say that the matchup
has shifted over the years where Ari
just really pulls you super hard early
cuz it's so difficult for the Ari to
really trade back. Um but if you ever
burn the flash from Oriana, that match
up gets super scary for the Oriana cuz
Ari just has so much potential set up.
Especially into Escana as well cuz the
Scana just ease behind you. It's like,
okay, cool. How on earth do I escape
this? I can command dissonance myself to
get a little bit of movement speed, but
it doesn't really matter into the
upheaval. It looks like Giant X might go
for a little bit more of a consistent
mid laner in terms of damage later on in
the game. The Azir gives them yeah,
solid front to back. You have Varys and
Azir. You've got good range as well. You
have some backline threat with the
Rumble, but instead Akali gives you more
backline threat with a little bit less
consistent DPS. I was going to say that
I think GX's comp is very standard, very
solid front to back. You have so many
tools, you know, you have solid laning
phase, you got pryo across the board,
like there's a lot you can do. And he
said, "You know what? It's Jackie. Slam
me in Akali." So, he wants a little bit
more skill expression. The great thing
about Akali into the Oriana match up
specifically is that you get to a point
where AI really can't do anything about
you. Um, but the ling haunting guises,
four haunting guys, how many he can keep
track of how many haunting guises he
built this time around. Maybe that's
going to be a bit of a shift. Um, but
the early laning phase definitely can be
a struggle. Again though, Oriana is a
champion. If you burn her flash, there's
a lot of setup for assassins to really
punish her for that. Um, so we'll see
how the mid lane match up plays out. As
the desk was talking, this is a match up
that we will be keeping our eyes on. And
the thing you have to respect is Nuke.
He's a player that he pushes you hard in
the laning phase. His laning has
improved so much compared to when he
started in the early to what he is now.
One of the top mid laners that we have
in the league. And if you give him an
inch, he is the type of player to take a
mile. But on the side of BDS, they have
a composition that has a lot more dive
threat. I would say it's a little bit
different to yesterday in the sense that
yesterday they brought out the Shen and
the Varys, which is really all about
locking down that single target. Um, but
this time around they've got a little
bit more pick potential. Of course, the
Jin can still follow up on things like
the shock wave. The Nar provides you
with a little bit more team fight value
and the Wakan with the mobility makes
following up on the noturn engages that
much quicker, but I guess they're not so
reliant on the knockdown engage because
they also have the Rakan there to
follow. We'll see how well BDS can enact
this game plan here against Giant X.
Both teams not truly do or die, but
pretty damn close for Giant X. If they
lose, they are out and Rogue knocked out
of contention for playoffs as well. or
BDS can lose and still make it through
via tiebreers, but can't lose and make
it in without those tiebreers. So, we
will see how well both teams do as we
make it onto Summoners Rift for our
first game of the day. Only 5 days left
of the LEC regular season ready and we
get to take a wee break before we come
back for our 3 weeks of playoffs. Three
weeks. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is. A
certain event also occurs during those.
What's that? Just is it the release of
the new Pokémon set? I don't know. Is it
Well, that I think it happens on the
18th is pre-release. So, okay. I mean,
the fact that you're hesitating on that
answer would disappoint your wife. Well,
it's either the 18th or 17th, and I keep
getting it wrong. I do know I'm going to
be in the shop making sure I'm getting
some of those ETBs, Betty. Okay. That's
one thing I've been asked to do. Fair
enough. Fair enough. All right. So, we
look across some of the runes that we
just saw on our screen. Phase rush on
Ariana I think is a great choice into
Akali specifically getting that extra
burst of movement speed is really
valuable just because you also apply
that slow onto Akali and then also get
the bonus movement speed it helps you
create that distance when she's really
threatening some sort of kill isma going
to be spotted out with the ward dropped
early from BDS to investigate where he
is beginning his jungle clear and locked
a player that I think really did stand
out because I think that so far in
spring he hasn't had the strongest of
performances but last week in Madrid he
really did show up for the team and GX
it was great getting to hear from them.
The excitement that they showed,
especially after their big victory on
the first day. Um, a lot of eyes are on
GX to see if they can make this miracle
turnound happen and if they can qualify
for the spring playoffs. It would be
pretty miraculous if they do manage to
do it. That G2 win, only their second
win so far in the LEC regular season for
BDS. They're playing their last series
of the regular season here against Giant
X. Giant X have one more against
Heretics at the end of week seven. It's
a bit surreal to think that this could
be BDS's last series of the splits. I
mean, it's could be the last series
until what, August? Start of August or
so for summer. Yep. That's that's a long
break. Like basically, it's like being
back at school. You just take a long
summer holidays and then come back, you
know? But we know how eager these
players are to compete and that's what
they want to be doing. So, everything on
the line today for both sides. We find
ourselves off with a timid start to the
game. very much as what we would expect
right now on the bot side of the map.
Losing out on that prow just because GX
decided to go for the Alistister doesn't
give you the strongest laning prowess
and especially with the Jin Raan does
give you a little bit more push. Mean in
the mid lane you're seeing very much
what we expected. Janke is being chipped
away at. So I just love the take notes
emote sliding down the bottom of the
screen as Isma makes his way over to his
razor beaks and will clear towards that
bottom side. Both the junglers as has
been mentioned are going down towards
that bot lane. Looks like 113 is about
to camp ahead right now as uh I wonder
if we will see a battle over the scuttle
crabs. Both the entrances for Isma have
been warded. So it's going to be a
little bit tricky for him to actually
find an avenue into that river
unspotted. And also he's going to be a
little bit slower than this knockdown on
the first clear. Jackie needs to be
thinking about pacing soon, but he's
just now going to pop his pot. If he
gets level four, he can survive a little
bit longer on the bot side. A bit of a
wave stacking up. Should make it easy
for 113 to be able to secure that bot.
Crap. But overall timid start to the
series very much as we we are only 3
minutes in as well. V. Yeah. I think
sometimes we can build ourselves up
getting into a series or the hyping
through draft the walkouts etc. and then
it's like oh nothing's happened for the
first four minutes. It's a standard
start I would say. Yeah. Standard. I'll
give you standard. I mean it's a
significant juosition to the traditional
solo queue experience where at this
point in the game people are already
typing FF. True, you know. So, ah, 113
smite not able to get in range in time.
Isma gets garnered. Yeah. Well, I was
hoping 113 did have a very small window
where I think he had a smite advantage
there. He could have flash smited.
Learned from Blabber. He could have done
that, could he? I mean, Blabber did it.
You know, how'd that pan out? I can't
remember the rest of the series. Pretty
sure it didn't go. I'm pretty sure
Pretty sure that was the end of the game
actually. It was a display of dominance
that they said, "Cool, you got the
crab." You're right. League officials
immediately stepped in and said, "All
right, we can call it here." The mercy
rule in League of Legends. If someone
flash smites your crab away from you,
they're just given the series. Now 113
because he started on Raptors. Um the
respawn timer had already come back up.
So he's already on his second clear
through the jungle. He is a little bit
faster than that of Isma who had to wait
for the wolves to respawn. And you can
see that he's already going to go back
to base. And this is tempo. Mhm. So,
he's already back out onto the map first
and he has a window where he can make a
play before Isma can respond. I don't
think he's going to, but he can if he
really wants to. We'll see if Gax can
deal with the whiplash of him being out
so quickly using this tempo so
effectively. Oh, it's Wolves Fetty.
Those Wolves going to struggle with it.
Just to remind you guys all of the
stakes of this game cuz we are joking
around a little bit at the start of it.
But for Giant X, if they win, BDS will
need a tiebreaker to qualify. Giant X
can still qualify via just winning out
their series, but maybe some tiebreakers
there as well. Whereas, if BDS wins,
Giant X and Rogue are fully eliminated
from playoffs. So, obviously, if you're
a Giant X fan, you kind of want them to
win. Not that you'd want them to lose
ever if you're a fan of them, but I do
think as well, I did do the uh the
fiveway tie setup. I need Well, yeah.
So, there is a possibility of a fiveway
tie between G2, BDS, SK, Giantex, and
Rogue. And for that to happen, Giant X
need to win this series. But the first
two series yesterday went the way that
we needed them to go. Oh, really? So,
with two out of how many series left?
Quite a few for that to happen. Okay.
Well, we'll keep track of that
throughout the day. I don't want to ask
you what the other results are cuz Oh, I
can tell you very quickly. I'll rack him
off quickly. Uh, so Vitality would have
to win next. Then heretics, then Koi,
then SK, then Casey, then Vitality, then
Casey, then Heretics, then Rogue, and
then we would have a fiveway tie for six
position. All right. Did you all keep
track of that? Did you all write that
down? Write it down. Noted. I take
notes. I mean, it's already been given.
Isma's been doing it.
It is a big a big fall from Grace for
BDS though if they don't make it to the
considering how they were. I mean last
year they were consistently a top three
team and for them to find themselves in
this position after making the roster of
changes that they did as ultis get
traded between the two top laners. Looks
like Lot is going to win out on that one
as he forces the flash away from
irrelevant. Ire has to be cautious of a
potential dive. Looks like yeah you can
see how hesitant he is. He's wary of the
potential dive. He drops the ward in the
brush as
well. And yeah, this is not ideal for
Irele. So he takes bad trades. He loses
his flash and he also loses the wave.
And now he also hasn't base yet, which
means that L is also going to come back
to wave quicker and it's already pushing
out that wave. So L already off to a
massive lead on the top side of that.
Yeah, it was already winning out in the
1 v one as well. You can see about a 20
CS lead for the Rumble over the Nard.
Jackie starting to trade in effectively
against Nuke who has gone for the tier
first. Sarah's an item we most commonly
see on the Oriana, especially into
things like Aali that want to burst you
down. I was wondering perhaps if Nuke
would go for the catalyst of Aeons build
where you just you start the Rod of Ages
but you never complete it. You just get
that catalyst, sit on it for the game
and then sell it for 900 gold third or
fourth item when you want to get a good
spike for later game. But I say we saw
it on Yeah, humanoid did it yesterday.
But seems like he's not going down that
route at least for now. I mean, credit
to Jackie. This can be a very difficult
match up, but he's done a good job of
staying even in CS. There's the first
haunting guy. Yeah, one mask down. Yep.
Uh we'll see if he continues to stack
those. For now though, really the only
significant advantage gain is on the top
side of the map. Grubs are already
spawned. No early prioritization on the
dragon. Are we going to see a swap come
through? I know that this has been a big
discussion pretty much throughout the
day yesterday. And I feel like that the
game So my opinion on the game state
right now is that isn't that big of a
deal. Sure. So between 15 and 20
minutes, the game just slows down a lot
as opposed to these first eight minutes
that have been break neck. Yeah, I mean
admittedly, but I understand for these
teams obviously along the line. So it
makes sense they would want to take
things slow in the early game. Is going
to start off the dragon. But that 15 to
25 minute window is actually where I
think is super interesting cuz teams I
think get very impatient when they don't
have a clear objective to necessarily
play for and that's where mistakes
happen. And so that's going to be this
window where both teams um need to focus
and make sure they're thinking very
clearly about what they want to do in
the next steps and they don't overstep
and make sure they give that opportunity
to their opposition to punish. It's
interesting how quickly sort of like the
collective memory of players and of
people shifts because up until 5 months
ago after never existed and there was
this huge gap in that time anyway. Baron
spawned at 20. The biggest difference if
you were in a winning position you could
force it. Good force bar at 20 on 113
hovering around top lane here. Oh, 113
is going to go in with the paranoia
flash away from Lot. The fear still
should connect here, but Isma's on his
way across. Has that impale 113 down as
is Lot. Now Isma trying to trade in with
the relevant, but has no flash to follow
up. Perfect execution from Jackis. Has
to flash away after using that ultimate.
Uses the R2 to escape across the wall.
So flash is exchanged in mid, a top
lane, and a jungler exchanged in top.
action kicking off now across the rift.
It was BDS that drew first blood, but as
you rightly identified, the exchange did
come through. Nice use of the spell
shield from 113 in that skirmish to
mitigate the knock back that was coming
through from Isma allowed him to stick
onto lot to make sure there was enough
damage to be able to secure that kill.
Will get an early TMAT as Isma now looks
to finish off the grubs, meaning all of
these early objectives actually going
the way of GX given that Isma chose to
stick around. Crucially in this mid
lane, both flashes used. Could be a
potential gank opportunity for both
sides. As we move closer to the mid
game, we look back at this play. The
ultimate comes down from 113. Flash to
make sure that he can connect the
tether. And then here, you'll notice the
spell shoot comes through. Isma not able
to drag him into the wall. Means that
113 has just enough time to be able to
get enough damage down. And they get the
flash out from Isma as well. Our steal
going to be
completed. Find ourselves one. Gold
still very even with a still a sizable
advantage in favor of lot. Yeah, the
advantage really is mostly that Rumble
in the top lane. Very powerful in the
lane. Can just push things out building
up towards his Leandre. Both the AD
carries have been switched towards the
mid lane. But Grubs and the Drake over
to Giant X puts him in good position at
least on the early neutrals. We didn't
see the first paranoia having as much
effect as 113 would like, but did manage
to pick up a kill in the end.
You'll notice now Oriana being moved
often into a side lane. Nuke has to be a
lot more passive than he was in the mid
lane. The longer lane, especially
without the flash, leaves him much more
prone to a potential gank and without
huge support from his team, he has to be
very cautious. And what you see on the
map right now is exactly what we're
talking about. He realizes that it's GX
that have the push in mid. They're
already moving into the botside jungle.
Nuke has to be very cautious. And this
is great for Jackie because he's
alleviated a lot of pressure. he can
help push out waves comfortably and he
can quickly start ramping towards that
first major item. And it's also why we
see Jun moving with Isma into that
jungle just to deny vision as well. Like
Nuke has no vision in his blue side
jungle. You never know where that
Alistister is. The Varys can deal with
the mid lane by himself. Has the
teleport as well. So even if it takes a
bad trade, can get back in there quickly
enough to hold down the fort on the tier
one. I mean, you can even see it on the
mini map. Just notice how hesitant he's
playing around this tower. There's just
very little vision as Medic was just
highlighting for us. And so he just has
to play super defensively and super
safe. And it's also why Paris recalls,
gets stacks on his uh warding item, and
then immediately runs back through this
blue side like, "Okay, I have to invest
some vision around here. At least have
to try and clear out some vision for the
Oriana. Puts one control ward around the
blue. Now we'll put one in the tri
bush." A lot of resources being invested
in making sure Nuke is safe in this bot
lane. Then we might see that change in
about a minute and a half time when
Nuke's flash is back up. But it's still
possible that BDS will want to make sure
Nuke gets towards that first second item
in a timely manner. And I'm looking at
113 here. Oh, paranoia going in. There's
the chase. Flash away from Noah into the
CC from Ice. The curtains open
immediately. 113 closes them on Noah.
That's the risk when you're playing
against a Jin and a Noctturn. I relevant
going in here as well. The equalizer on
the wrong side from lot if element not
tanking it at all. Lot has no flash.
Element needs two more autos but the
scrap shields enough to keep lot alive.
Meanwhile, Paris caught out down towards
the bottom side of quickness and dashes
away to nuke gets to safety and survives
a possible dive. Action happening across
the rift as it's 113 to initiate the
play in the mid lane. Finding that
valuable pick onto Noah, but GX
responding kind on the bot side of the
map. Zoning Nuke away from valuable
farm. stealing away 113's camps and
doing what they can to chip away at this
bot tower. It's GX that still hold on to
the gold lead thanks to the advantages
that they built at top lane. But now
Jackie after getting these isolated
plates has a gold lead over Nuke as
well. He's about 500 gold ahead. Has two
of those masks now. So truly starting up
some sort of masquerade ball on that
Akali. We'll see how far he goes. Like
the the passive on them isn't unique
which is important to talk about. Like
whenever you see someone stacking
multiple of these items, often you'll
look at it, especially in modern day
League, it's like that doesn't make too
much sense. But importantly, madness is
not unique on haunting guys. So you can
stack it up a few times and get extra
bonus damage out of being in combat.
Looking to spot out Isma, who's now
working on his third objective of the
game, but you are right. We'll see how
much value Jackis ends up getting out of
the build. last time things didn't quite
work out the way that he
wanted. So far, this dragon is going to
go uncontested. So, BDS conceding a
decent amount here in the early game. I
think GX is playing around the map very
well and lots I mean even though a
decent amount of resources was thrown
towards him on the top side of the map.
He's done a great job in isolation
tanking the ganks. Obviously, he came
very close to losing his life against
1113, but he does survive it. He holds
on to the gold lead for now.
He's now hitting that Leandre working
towards that second item. So this Rumble
is scaling nicely. Let's not forget
irrelevant did pick the N into this and
so far that pick is not panning out.
Maybe he can find that huge ultimate
that can swing things in his favor as
Jun invests some vision on the top side
of the map. I mean Jun has been all over
the map with vision in this game. I want
to give him a lot of credit. You see how
often he's in the right position to get
vision down to make sure that 113 can't
find a sneak attack somewhere. 1113 is
pathing up towards the top side. D comes
across to ward it out and then 113
immediately starts to back away position
down towards that bottom side as well
but he can't back away from this the
paranoia into
shockwave no vision would have saved him
there locked down to half HP isma
stepping forward as well Jun coming in
from the side but no real follow up no
real damage here right now for Giant X
they're continuing to poke and prod the
suppression onto Paris there's the
impale as well they'll pull him back the
quickness doesn't really come off in
time with that grand entrance BDS still
looking for a little bit more, but it's
pretty scattershot here. Betty ends up
being a one for one as Paris overstays
his welcome, but Noah, there was very
little he could do. Both teams still
sizing each other up in the river. Flash
headb over ice equalizer. Nuke flashes
across the wall. And here's Akali to
chase him down. Jackis gets one. Ice the
next target as they dash away up. Evil
just sliding by. Ice unable to get that
final bit of damage. GX not happy with
how the first skirmish ended, so they
wanted to go for more. And they get a
pick onto Nuke. Isma making that drift
happen was honestly very surprising. The
fact that he was able to still connect
Nuke into that wall meant that they
could follow up, get themselves another
kill. Ice though, I mean, he was ice
cold in that play. He held on to his
summoner spells. He walks away with all
of them up. GX build a slightly larger
lead. Nothing significant going to come
off the back of it. Herald, of course,
is still alive and I imagine they're
going to look to try and start that one
off. That's what all the fighting was
really about. Lot and Jun coming across
to cover their bot side. Make sure this
red buff isn't stolen away. Next drake
up in 2 and a half minutes. So, still a
while before we see either of the teams
having to battle around that. It's about
a,000 gold lead, 800 or so for Giant X
now. And a lot of that is focused on
Jackis in the mid lane and lot on the
top side. 113 has been able to get
himself ahead. You know, he's got two of
those three kills for BDS as Jun is
caught out just a smidge. Shock wave's
going to bring him back. Unbreakable
will not available to the Alistister now
as lock comes in from the side but can't
really protect J from Nuke. BDS get
another on the board. Nice play there
from J as he gets caught out. Nuke
getting some much needed gold as Jackie
now finds himself in a side lane against
irrelevant overall. While the kills do
slightly favor BDS, GX are really the
ones running the map. Ultimate going to
come through from lot to clear out that
wave. Keep behind as well. Jackie's
trying to collapse onto Nuke here.
Paranoia is available for 113. Jackie
has the perfect execution. 1113 just
waiting in the bush. Jackie dancing
forward. Nuke trying to dance around in
the shield. Just enough with the Seraphs
to keep Nuke alive. Less than 100 HP
there. Falling down to about 50. Value
of Zeraps really proving its worth there
as he keeps Nuke alive. But you're
seeing the threat that the Akali can
provide onto the Oriana White. It's
going to be that much harder in a side
lane. Jackie is obviously off to a
fantastic start in this game and he's
only going to become more problematic as
the game continues. The Herald now
dropped into mid lane as JS want to keep
the pressure up. They secure the bot
tier one. They're going to open up the
mid tier one soon. They're likely going
to put themselves in a fantastic map
state ready for the oncoming dragon in
about a minute's time as well. If they
can secure this tower, it makes it that
much easier to push in this mid wave,
move into enemy jungle, set up that
control, and be ready to put yourself on
soul point. Yeah, the only problem for
Giant X in the next couple of minutes is
that Jackie did use his TP to get down
towards that bottom side. But Noah has
teleport, and Lot has it, right? So,
you're still going to be able to answer
at least some of that side lane
pressure. Drake up in 40 seconds would
be sole point for Giant X if they can
find it. Item and a half on both of
BDS's key carries. the Oriana and the
Jin on the other side. Jackie is still
right. He's playing behind the masks.
Hasn't needlessly large rods alongside
it. But I wonder if he's going to
complete an item soon. Does he need to?
Is Haunting guys just this OP? That's a
great question that I don't have an
answer for you. Same. I like I know it's
a it's a workable build. I just don't
know at what point you have to switch
away from just the masks, you know? 113
pops the alt. Paranoia. There's the
shock wave hits onto Lot, but he has a
stopwatch. TP going onto the back line
as well as Paris comes in with the
quickness. There's the curtain call as
well. They're trying to kill off Lock
and they'll find him first. Isma looking
for nuke, but can't quite get the damage
down. Jackie coming in from the side as
well. Chases onto Irele. Uses him as a
quick taxi to get onto the backline and
chases Ice down. But Ice with a flash
and Paris escaping as well. BDS managed
to get all five members out alive, but
they is still a drake to be fought over.
No impale, no chain, no unbreakable
will. No ultimates on the other side
either. Nukes shock wave about halfway
off its cool down. Giant X have the
health bars and they are going to be
able to secure the drake unless
something very special happens from BDS.
I mean it was a nice engage from BDS. It
really looked like that they were going
to just walk away with that team fight.
But the arrival of Jackis and the
backline damage he was able to do just
forces the carries away from the fight.
Nuke and Ice immediately get zoned away.
There's very little that they can do to
stop it. So the engage comes through.
Jackis isn't there. The TP is quick from
irrelevant. He gets a really nice mega
off onto many people. Noah really
struggles to have impact in the fight.
Doesn't connect on his Q. And you can
just see the combo coming through. It
looks lethal. It looks very bad for GX.
But then Jackie arrives. He uses his
ultimate. Immediately turns his
attention on to Paris and Ice. They're
then forced to disengage. An early heal
comes out from Paris to help his AD
carry survive. But as we get back out
onto the map, BDS set their sights on
Anakan and they're going to get it
uncontested. Yeah, because they didn't
die, they were able to reset immediately
and just walk their way up towards the
Attakan. Giant X had to spend a little
bit more time defending their position
around the Drake. So, it's soul point
versus an Artakan. I think Giant X were
going to get the dragon anyway. Is here
comes the shockwave paranoia combo once
again. Lot did flash away and 113 will
burn to death. Lot falls to irrelevant.
He tries to dash out but he takes the
tower shot and his life is for forfeit.
Good dodge on the impale into the chain
of corruption. Cleanse away by ice.
Paris distracting everyone. Should be
able to dodge dodge away himself.
Jackie's TP up in about 10 seconds time,
but all the while he's just pushing that
tier 2 in bot lane. It's still a two for
one in favor of Giant X as Lot was able
to find a very nice outplay. And by that
I mean he threw his ultimate down and
then he started burning everything
around him. Uh 113 was not tanky enough
to weather the damage and the arrival of
Jun to just provide that extra bit of CC
helping set up for a double kill in
favor of L. Looks like Jackie is
actually going to secure that tower as
well. So nothing but wins across the
board here for GX. You take that if
you're Giant X. Still only about a
thousand gold ahead, but in such a
strong position for your carries. A lot
of AP coming out. Shadow Flame now
complete for Jackis. He's finally
finished that uh first item, although
not using either of the Haunting Geysers
is in his inventory. 113 goes in here B,
but as you say, it's just the burn from
lock that takes him down. And irrelevant
also standing on at the moment that he
gets knocked up with the tower shot as
well means that it's enough damage to
turn it into a two for one. And then
Paris just buying time. He knows that he
has the mobility to use nuke to get
away, but we immediately return to the
map state. GX looking to chip away at
Paris's HP bar. Not going in. Remember,
doesn't have the flash. Grand entrance
into the shock wave, but pops the zas in
time. And now 113 is being held down on
by Noah. Lot putting the damage back
down with the equalizer. And Lot gets
the kill on the enemy knock. Irelevant
has been pushing bot this entire time.
Should be able to take that tower down.
So BDS who gets something on the other
side of the map at the expense of their
jungler's life. That was just a fight
for control as GX, they wanted a bit of
vision into the entrance of BDS's
topside jungle. Paris didn't want to
allow it to happen, but he took way more
damage than he was expecting, forcing
BDS to try and respond.
Atmitted
weaker 113 is just
too much solos him out of the fight
meaning that GX get themselves another
kill. The gold is not inflating heavily
in the way of GX. But I think it's
misrepresentative of how much stronger
GX really is right now. It feels that
with this Akali on a side lane like Nuke
is scared and he very much should be
even though he has the level advantage.
Akali has more than enough kill threat
and without proper support, Nuke is in
danger. So Jex in a fantastic position.
They're waiting for the next dragon to
spawn, but Baron is going to be up at
the same time. And it gives them a lot
of luxury because they can choose
between whether they want to play for
the dragon or play for the baron. And
they can force BDS into this very
difficult choice. Yeah, we'll see what
Giant X decide to do. Playing for their
lives here in the LEC spin. Currently
deciding just to take away this red
buff. have set up their vision line
pretty well in towards this red side
jungle. Irrelevant pushing out, but I
think Lot will be sent down to deal with
that. Currently, he's kind of hovering
around mid. Maybe expecting when Noah
steps up that 113 will look for that
Oriana Nocturn combination
again. The uh the dark darkness blender,
I guess, what do you want to call it?
Like paranoia shock wave. Jake also
tried to come up with a name for it
yesterday.
Well, he thought it was the submarine
and I had to explain what that's Twitch
with Shen. Yeah, it's cuz you go
underneath, you're invisible, and then
you pop up. Surprise.
Um I don't know. You ever been scared in
the dark before? What do you call that?
Fear of wolves for me. I was There's a
Doctor Who episode where the queen turns
into a werewolf, and that one had me
sleeping with a nightlight for a while.
Combo. It's the Queen Elizabeth werewolf
combo with Nocturn Oriana. The thing
that terrified me was the girl from the
ring. I never watched the R. Still
haven't watched it. I wouldn't recommend
it. TVs just become a point of fear
moving forward. Use as a TV in this day
and age. Betty
projectors is where it is where it's at.
Giant X setting up around the bottom
side here. Infernal Drake their real
prize, but all they want to do is have
BDS stack into the meat grinder. Nuke
using the ball to scout out a little
bit. Jack is looking for the flank.
Irrelevant trying to mark him. doesn't
quite know where he is. Does now as
Jackie jumps in, jumps out.
A ticket with the blue buff to escape
what could have been a precarious spot.
Drake has spawned. Giant X taking a
little bit of poke here. Playing around
that mid wave. You can see Noah charging
up that piercing arrow. Still finds his
mark. Isma's going to start up the
drake. I think there's vision in the
back of the pit that BDS are relying on
right now. Oh, it's cleared out by that
control ward. though. BDS don't know for
sure that this has been started.
Irrelevant. No mega nar for him. Nuke
taking a chunk. Dragon down to 7,000.
Paris still stepping forward. Giant X
playing in the darkness. Jun goes in.
113 flashes away as there's the paranoia
equalizer separate the team. 113 going
in looking for the smite. Lands it. No
soul for Giant X but perhaps the fight.
A great nar into the wall. Locks. Jack
is against it. going in as well, but
he's sure to flash impale from Isma and
Noah untouched so far. Lock falling
lower has the zas buys himself a second.
Isma slams Paris into the wall who gets
the grand entrance, but no grand exit
for him. The fight goes in Giant X's
favor as Noah finds the final shot
through the heart of Nuke. The drake
secured for BDS, but the fight in favor
of Giant X. It's a huge team fight win
for GX, even though they ended up losing
the dragon. A nice steal comes through
from 113 as Jun tries to deter him from
entering the pit. But once the ultimate
drops, he has an avenue into the dragon
pit and he's able to get a clutch steel.
Then the fight kicks off. Jackie sets
his sights onto the backline immediately
gets impaled into the wall. And it's at
this point where you're looking at the
HP bars and it looks scary, but then
Isma with the nice flash I impale to
turn the fight in the favor of GX
because Lot buys enough time thanks to
the Zas to be able to reset with his
team. Noah comes up and then the comet
ends up clearing up the final kill
allowing JX to win out on the fight. 113
caught out a little bit in his jungle.
Paris here to act as a bit of a
bodyguard. Jumps in with the entrance
and Battle dances his way out. Baron
still up of course a 3,000 gold lead now
for Giant X. Three items complete on
Noah and almost on Jackie. He's got a
blood letters, a shadow flame, and a
haunting guys. 210 stacks for Isma as
well. Often we see heart steals not
stacked up that much in pro. So credit
to him. He's been finding fights. He's
been getting his clinks which as every
AAM player knows vital thing to
do. I mean right now GX is just in a
fantastic position. We haven't really
seen a significant gold lead for GX
throughout the game, but now with a 2.5k
gold lead and these items coming
through, I guess you could argue that
when you actually look at the
itemization, it doesn't look that
significantly different. The fact that
Nuke has death cap as well, that kind of
both mid laners pretty much even in
terms of itemization depending on how
much value you put behind the haunting
guys contributing to all the additional
damage is generating from the other two
items. I'd say they're pretty even right
now. I'd agree with you there. and the
AD carries are also I mean they're both
bang on three items so the gold is
deceptive but just the way the fights
are playing out it feels like the GX are
just playing them better execution and
they're walking away with I mean we've
seen multiple times now them walking
away with just more kills and more
advantages being cautious in the side
lane as he gets closer to 16 and the
reason he's being cautious is oh I
pressed entirely the wrong button here
this is why I don't use it um 113 was
spotted on that ward that little control
ward there as He walks down towards the
bottom lane. So Jackie knew 113 was in
the area which is why he then started to
step all the way back as opposed to
trading a little bit more with
irrelevant which is what Jackis tends to
do in his side lane 1 v one. So good
deep vision 113 should have checked the
bush as he walked past but very easy to
miss miss that because your natural
pathing if you just click down towards
the bottom tri bush doesn't always take
you through it.
J now testing the waters in BDS's
jungle. Baron becomes the next big point
of contention, but Jix could say it's
too much of a risk and instead wait for
the next dragon to spawn in about a
minute and a half. Remember that we're
still waiting to see that shotgun. And
here it is. There's the shock wave, the
shotgun combo. And there's the curtains.
The clothes quickly shut on Noah 113
pulled back underneath the tower. He's
going to die as well. So, it's a one for
one exchange. jungler for AD carry as
BDS do find the shotgun but only had one
bullet in it. Yeah, that is the risk of
the composition, but they do take out
Noah. Uh he did have some huge value in
the last team fight, but then Jackie's
picking up that kill is only going to
put the Sakali even further ahead. One
for one is not the ideal situation for
BDS given that it's GX that are pushing
in these lanes, getting more control
over the map. I like the vision coverage
the BDS currently have over the bot side
of the map ready for the dragon because
GX now have to invest their resources
into clearing out all of this vision
which they're setting their sights on
doing now. Paris doing what he can to
still provide some information for his
team. They haven't spotted this control
ward still.
Now it's BDS that once again finds
themselves on the back foot. Jack is
tping for a flank position here towards
the top side as well. Jun going to get
knocked up. There's the equalizer down.
Jack is trying to get in. irrelevant
about to go mega nar here will get the
nar back but only onto Isma locked lot
against the wall but not real too much
follow up there's the shock wave and the
quickness combination we kept thinking
about the paranoia and forgot about the
quickness lot flame spitter is
irrelevant down flashes away himself 113
on the chase now as lot goes into the
overhe and burns through 113 is across
the wall is now in the middle of four
lands the impale but dies for it BDS
fight back only noah left standing
paranoia will get rid of the edge Knight
and in goes 113 again. It's curtains for
Noah. A great fight for BDS. It's an ace
for BDS out of nowhere in a map state
where it felt like GX was riding the
momentum making it impossible for BDS to
find the play. They're able to find the
angle. Noah wasn't with the team. BDS
had a numbers advantage. And the shock
wave that came through from Nuke, the
engage that comes through from Paris was
a gamechanging play. We look at this
poke coming through from GX. Testing the
waters. The Rumble ultimate comes
through. Jackie is on the flank. They
force the flash out from Ice. But it's
at this point where irrelevant gets the
ulti. He sees the stun that comes down
onto Jackie. And then the follow up from
both Paris and Nuke. Then at this point,
it just becomes a chase. Lot is doing
insane damage. You think at this point
there's even a window where he'll even
get himself another kill. Fortunately,
his team is there to help secure that
kill. Isma thinks that with Noah maybe
they can get more but Noah is not in a
position to follow up. We get back to
live and J is trying to interrupt this
Baron. Paris looking for the knockup.
Jun flashes forward though. 1113 has to
flash away. TP coming in from irrelevant
who has just come out of base. Sterax
complete for him. Mega trying to build
it up. Needs to jump over the wall. Goes
mega as he does so has enough health to
survive. Giant X might use that as their
Q to go towards the Baron knowing that
113 is low. No flash now on that knock,
but they won't quite well. They won't
decide to immediately force it. Lot will
get the mid pryo. Looks like resets
coming out from Jun and
Isma. A tense situation now as the game
kind of resets. BDS have done a
successful job of denying the soul away
from GX. Baron is still a scary
objective to just start up on a whim,
especially given that Noah is going for
that lethality build. They don't have
the fastest baron taking team on the
side of GX. I mean, irrelevant shows bot
though and had just used his teleport
from the fountain to the mid lane. So,
Giant X will just immediately start this
up. 113 has the paranoia and we have the
shock wave. I'm going to call it the
dishwasher, Betty, cuz it spins, it's
dark, and you get rinsed if it hits you.
We'll see if they want to use that combo
if they can use it effectively. Jack is
on a good flank position. Now, there's a
little bit of vision in the pit. Paris
puts a ward in. They know it's being
done. Jun looking for the hex flash.
Elements worked his way up from the bot
side. Baron has been stopped. The Impale
going in as well as they try and lock up
113 who will die. Everything in darkness
for the moment now we pop back into
sight. Paris looking for that engage.
Can't find it. BDS will play around the
mid lane pryo for now. Baron being
pinged by Giant X. They want to start it
again. Jackie still has that flank
position and has his ultimate. That
perfect execution available to him. It's
the only ultimate available to all of
Giant X. A quickness, a shock wave from
Paris and Nuke could quite quickly kill
off Giant X. There's the curtain call.
Jackie still unable to find a way on
towards the backline. Paris stepping
forward. Baron secured. Jackie goes in
immediately knocked up and stunned with
the quickness, but Jackie finds one.
It's Luke dead on the back line. Ice
trying to open up. He'll take down lot.
Irrelevant bar to go mega, but Ice is so
far away. Can they re-engage? Noah at
half HP. Chain of Grudgeon buffered out
by irrelevant, but good poke onto him
means that he's walking away wounded and
Giant X get the Baron. A very nice baron
overall from GX as remember the initial
baron start was used to find that pick
onto 113 with no smite available.
They're basically relying on Nuke or Ice
to be able to find a clutch steal with
their ulti, but they're not able to find
it. The position is quite threatening as
the ulti drops down from Ice and Nuke is
in a position to steal with the shock
wave. The shock wave comes through. It
doesn't quite do enough damage and then
Jackie turns his attention onto the back
line. Very nice pick onto N. A follow-up
kill onto the Rakan. But then once they
lose their front line, GX realize we
don't have the HP to chase this. Will be
happy with the
Baron with 2 minutes left on the Baron
buff. Lot not getting it. Obviously
pretty impactful for them or dying at
least. He's almost at four items on this
rumble of element stepping forward. TP
coming out from Lot. Drake up in a
minute's time. Both teams just scuffling
for this vision control. Jackis is
pushed in the bot side. BDS, all five
members close enough. You could throw a
towel over them right now. Everyone
grouped up in mid. Element is going to
work his way down towards that bottom
lane. BDS unable to step forward to gain
control of the mid wave. Ice trying to
catch it as high as he can. Keep the
possibility of BDS pushing Giant X out
of this jungle, but Jun takes control as
does Isma. They'll clear out any BDS
vision. And now BDS are fighting into
the darkness.
I will say as we get closer to this
dragon, Ice is nothing but exceptional
on this Jin. constantly finds ways to
build gold leads and I mean with a
605 KDA this game finding a way to avoid
death. He's level 18 365 CS as well. His
positioning is so reliable and he has
often been the consistent carry for this
BDS roster. Let's see if he can turn
this game around for his team. The ball
is on 113. 113. There's the shock wave
onto Jackie's equalizer. Goes a mile
wide. They would have been able to dodge
away from it. Has the teleport as well.
Jackie's down to about a third HP. BDS
still looking to get some purchase
on a location in this river. TP coming
out from irrelevant miss BDS. They've
got no ammo. They can't reload. They've
used the ulti is now that one shot
potential is gone. Jackies will return
to the frey. Irrelevant face checks lock
has to jump away. There's the zas out of
lock. That's big. Nuke from the side.
Lot has to flash away. 7,000 HP now on
the drake. 113 looking for that steal
again. Doesn't have the flash. The
curtain's open. Jackis can get on
towards the backline here. Drake
secured. It's Infernal Soul. The
Brickness comes out and Jackis falls
twice. BDS. Although they've lost the
Drake, they've lost the soul. Maybe they
can win the fight. Ice stepping forward
again. There's a double for the Jin
yesterday. Woods four. There's three.
Make it more for BDS. Only Isma and Noah
left alive as Ice continues to chase,
but probably doesn't have the range to
catch up with Noah. EDS find another
successful fight. Even though their
initial burst combo doesn't really gain
them much in the extended trade, they're
able to turn things around. So much
credit needs to be given to Paris. The
quick reactions to chain C. You see
Jackie coming in from the flank meant
that Jackie was null and void before he
could really do anything. BDS now with
the numbers advantage, set their sights
on the bot lane tower and they're
looking to stay relevant in this game
one. Probably just two tier twos for BDS
off this though. You can see Paris
should be able to collect the local gold
from that mid lane tower falling. So BDS
take a gold lead, but remember Isma
secured the soul. He won the smite
fight. So it's going to be a difficult
fight back as you say V. Jackis tries to
get onto ice and immediately Paris is
there. Just such a good response from
Paris. And at this point Lot then gets
locked up. He doesn't have his flash
available. He doesn't have the Zas
either. Jun doing what he can to keep
his teammates alive.
Ice does commit his flash to securing
that third
kill, but PDS keeping their hopes alive
here in this first game. Baron up in a
minute
40. Ice full build 905. A Medi for Nuke.
Six stacks on it. Jackie's almost had
his fourth item as well. The Rabidons
his prize at the end of that uh gold
rainbow. I
guess the question for BDS is can they
win fights? Like can is Jackie going to
overextend onto the backline in a
similar way? Will the shockwave
dishwasher combination work out for them
when you have two zyas on the enemy
team? What's crucial to recognize is
Noah does a lot of poke damage. Yeah.
And so really when you think about the
consistent DPS, if you ignore kind of
Jackie wanting to try and assassinate
someone on the back line, it's very much
reliant on lot. And so when he doesn't
have his flash available, when the
ultimate was already used very early on
before the fight really kicked off and
then the fact that he didn't have his
available either became very difficult
for him to really impact that fight in
the way that he would have wanted to.
Now he's got the death cap available.
His flash is still about 2 minutes away.
He's a player that will have to keep our
eyes on moving into the next fight
because he's going to be crucial. But
we're basically nearing full build
across the board. The gold is meaning
less and less by the minute. BDS was in
a similar situation yesterday where they
fell short to Fnatic in the final
moments. A single fight could very well
determine the entire game. And in this
situation, it all comes down to
execution. Jackie, will he have enough
for the death gap?
Yes, he does. Okay, so both sides are
happy with the itemization that they've
gotten and now we're just building
towards the Baron. I think for BDS, a
single player, making sure they press
tab and and ping the fact that Noah has
a zas as well could change the outlook
of this fight cuz so often you just go
on the AD carry and think, oh, we can
burst him right here. He's got edge of
knight. He's got the zas. If you go for
him, the team is immediately going to
collapse on you and you're not going to
kill off that vary. You can see the poke
he's doing with the piercing ammo and
the infernal flash forward. There's the
equaliz and Jack is immediately on the
back line. Shockwave has to be used to
try and disengage. Paris flies in once
again with the quickness, but Jackis is
having none of it. He'll get the kill.
It's a one for one exchange as both the
mid laners fall. Jackis was committed
for at the very least getting his one.
He will secure the kill onto Nuke, but
he had to invest everything to get it
now with both mid laners gone. Irelevant
will TP back into the fight. But what's
he really tping for? 113 doesn't have
the HP to really go for any more of a
fight. His ultimate is unavailable. The
poke connects. Self show down as well
now for 113. He's going to have to go
back into his jungle to try and heal up
some of that HP. In fact, just going to
go for the recall. Isma constantly
poking across the wall there. Paris
looking for the engage. J goes in onto
irrelevant head but pulverize. Ireleant
about to go mega but 113 is a mile away.
Doesn't have that paranoia back up.
Baron available to both teams. Jackie
has TP in 15 as does Nuke. Their respawn
timers basically equal between the two
of them now.
Me unfortunately for Nuke not really
getting a huge amount of value. It's the
Magi's curse, man. You buy it, you have
to immediately die. It's just the way it
works. Down to two stacks. BDS gain
position over the Baron after GX need to
commit some resets. Wards now
replenished by Jun, but Paris is
basically out. Oh, this is really good
positioning from Paris. See if he can
find something sneaky here. Noah's going
to check the bush though. Paris pops the
quickness. 113 looking for the engage,
but Paris is already down. Could have
jumped across the wall. Decided not to
do it. Jackis dives in. Jackis dives for
it. A one for one exchange. Just two
players getting caught. This late into
the game, you can't be trying to make
those isolated hero plays because BDS
has proven that they're way too good at
locking you down and shutting you out.
Jackie needs more of a distraction
before he can look to try and make those
plays. The good news for BDS is that GX
ultimately got too hypy. They saw that
pick. They wanted to try and fight for
more when they should have just turned
their attention back towards the Baron.
Tried to use that to force another fight
given the 113 had already used his ulti.
So, we return to a neutral step state.
The Elder spawns in 20 seconds and it's
BDS that have position over the dragon.
And Jackie won't be alive for the spawn
of this Elder who will be up a couple of
seconds afterwards, but doesn't have
teleport. remember used it to get back
in to the last fight around the baron.
BDS trying to set up around the elder.
Paris on his way down through mid.
Currently just passing the inhibitor
line. BDS have the vision control. You
can see Giant X trying to poke through
here. See if they can spot anything. Now
Jackie's respawns immediately sprinting
his way to join the rest of his
team. BDS playing through the mid lane.
Pryo could just go for the Baron as
well. don't really want to give up the
elder. Nuke and 1113 stepping forward
perhaps looking to see if they can catch
out Jackies. 1113 goes in, but Nuke
wasn't ready to pop the shock wave. Now
113 has to use the spell shield to get
out. The paranoia down for a little
while at least and BDS's
opportunity to put Jackie through a
quick cycle comes up short. Get the
idea. But onto an Akali. That was going
to be a very difficult task.
That ulti from 113 being unavailable for
the Elder is a scary situation for BDS
to be in. We turn our attention to ice
once more. 1006 the score line for him.
Reminiscent of what we saw from him
yesterday. The elder getting lower and
lower and BDS can't find a way into the
river. 113 doesn't have a quick route in
either cuz that paranoia is still not
off cool down. Curtain's open. Relevant
looking for it. Equalizer onto ice. He
has to step off. 113 trying to get close
but the impel will lock him up. And
there's the Elder Drake over to Giant X.
And with how close the fights have been,
you have to feel this is the opportunity
for Giant X to really win things out.
They find two. They'll turn their eyes
instead of the fight towards the Baron.
And that might just be the final nail in
the coffin for BDS. It's been an intense
back and forth between the two teams,
but without that Noctturn alt available,
BDS did not have an easy way to contest
the dragon. They concede the Elder. They
will lose the Baron and now GX is in a
prime position to take game one of this
best of three.
45 minutes in. Man, the last couple of
weeks have been full of these long
games. Close back and forth. Maybe we'll
see a nexus left on one HP again for
Giant X. It's really well played. Like
113 obviously has already used the
paranoia. Equalizer going onto the
curtain call means Ice can't get more
shots out. And then the impale on 113 as
he tries to get in just locks him up. It
was a very challenging approach for BDS
and Jun doing a good job of gatekeeping
the river. Yeah. Now we turn our
attention back to live. 45 minutes in.
GX is fully empowered with both the
spirit of Elder and Baron. But not of
Atakan.
While that is true, I don't think they
care.
They'll set their sights on the first
inhibitor tower of the game. Yeah, they
have two wave two waves left of the
Elder Dragon buff. So, they want to try
and escort these minions in. Keep them
alive as long as they can because
otherwise becomes hard to really force
into BDS's base. Probably committing
onto this lane though. You look across
the mini map and those wave states are
not ideal. This could be great for BDS
to stall things out. 42 seconds before
the Elder expires.
Equalizer does clip onto Irele. Nuke has
to flash away. Ireleant trying to get
towards the mega, but the wave coming in
with the equalizer splitting BDS up.
There's the shock wave onto Jackis. He
manages to dash away. Paris trying to
survive. Gets impaled. It's two members
in there. Irrelevant yeed back and all
he can do is get Giant X closer to his
nexus in a 46inut slot best. Giant X
will go 10 up. With so much on the line,
Giant X are able to find the crucial
fight needed to secure game one. They
want to keep their playoff hopes alive
and they're able to do it against BDS.
We'll be right back after a short break
to see if Giant X can keep themselves in
the running for playoffs.
[Music]
He doesn't like that. Look at him. He's
a good boy, but he don't like that.
Maybe we could play some AAS or
something like that. I mean, this is a
map, right? New tower.
Have a break. Have a Kit Kat.

I cannot s flash.
I'm looking double.
Yeah, I see that. Really good. Can you
give me both? I go
flash to
Good jump. Good. The grand entrance, but
no grand exit for him. The fight goes in
Giant X's favor as Noah finds the final
shot.
Nice. So important draft cuz it's
important games. It did seem to me like
BDS they have been tunneling quite a bit
on this kind of Noctturn Oriana but they
gave you a lot of power picks in the
process. So what's your view on the
draft? Uh I think both teams have tools.
Um they have a way to win the game with
an Oriana. We have uh good ways to to
avoid it later on. So I think it's just
going to be a matter of of execution.
Okay. How does the the camp feel overall
knowing that it's really do or die and
regardless of what happened in Madrid,
it Yeah, it could be over. I mean, we
are just thinking of next game. Uh
trying to to enjoy uh playing on stage.
Uh not think too much about playoffs.
We'll just do the math at the end.
Madrid was a hell of an experience both
there and when the lights went out. Uh
so we just happy to to be back in in
Berlin and and now just enjoying the
game and we'll do the math at the end.
All right. How many masks is Jackie
going to build? You think this game? I
hope too. Okay. I hope I don't see a
third. Let's see. But you never know. By
now we'll already know the answer. So,
back to you.
Most teams do have tools indeed. And
that Noxion Oriana, honestly, Odo, at
one point, I was like, "Yo, BDS is
bringing this back. They're going to
close out the game." But then it was
like, "No, GX brought it back. They're
going to close out the game." And it was
like, "What?" Yeah. It it devolved into
this weird Fiesta. I feel like the No
provided a lot of early game value, but
I still feel like it wasn't nearly
enough. And going into late game, I felt
like it became more of this utility pick
in that sense where I felt like it
wasn't really their their main way to
win the game. Because as we saw we ice
started to take over the game. He became
incredibly strong but still a lot of
execution misplays I feel like because
even now in this early game the what I
what I would like to showcase here is
that GX is doing everything perfectly
fine. They have such amazing vision
control. The the whole both side of the
map is littered with wards but off the
screen you are never safe on this mid
lane and this is literally the only
avenue where BDS can find plays. But the
problem is that even though they find
this play, they have no follow because
their control is not set up. Normally as
a Varys, you expect to be very safe in
mid lane. Um, and you're completely
right. They did everything right in
regards to putting the vision down to
save the save themselves from the
knockdown. You still have to play a
little bit back though. And that made
the game very interesting in terms of I
feel like there are largely three parts
to that game. Early game, great
objective dominance coming through from
GX even if the gold was a little bit in
favor of BDS. But then obviously that
didn't last through to a full soul. They
didn't cleanly get to Infernal Soul. It
extended the game. So then we had this
whole mess of mid game where Dr. Orient
did crazy and then we ended up with, you
know, um the roller coaster once again,
but the early game was all about the
objectives from GX. Didn't quite finish
it off. Had to build up like double zas
and to get towards that late game and
then they could finally close it out.
Exactly. You you nail it uh you nail it
on the head perfectly. I felt like this
was one of these games where BDS needed
to give these objectives to to find the
gold lead and I guess the the goal lead
randomly happened because the virus it
happened somehow. It wasn't because of
the objectives. Yeah, it's because Varus
had Edge of Night, had Zia. That's why
we saw a big power drop in um GX's
teamcom because it felt like team fights
were starting to swing away from them.
The Jin was full was building full
damage. The Oriana was was pretty safe
and later on whoever engaged first was
pretty much the team that was losing. I
mean, Ice as well has been really
instrumental for BDS on this Jin. We've
seen it yesterday as well and he's
really trying his absolute hardest to
carry some of these fights and he puts
the team in a good position, but I felt
like midame specifically BDS just
dropping the ball every now and
then. It's really difficult because we
talked about Nuke a lot in the pregame
and obviously is a big engine part of
this. But when it came through to most
of the damage that was coming through
from this comp, it was the longrange
follow up from the Jin. Ice has been
exceptional for this team. I actually
don't know where they'd be without him
without Jin games like this. yesterday
could have arguably carried as well.
Strikers did say that Nuke is is the
heart of this team, but I do feel like
it's it was mostly Ice because when when
everything goes bad and when I think of
BDS's best games is when um Nuke is,
sorry, not Nuke, when Ice is finding
this this foothold. But at the same
time, big props to GX because I feel
like this game went to a place where it
wasn't really theirs to win anymore. It
felt like they didn't really have tools
to win the game. They didn't really have
consistent engage to deal with the
Oriana with the Jin, but still the
misplays I guess came to bite them back.
And now it does feel like we get to a
very tense situation. This was not a
one-sided game as we thought it might be
after like a really early soul point. JX
did manage to close it out and BDS,
they've used this kind of tunnneled
knock on Ariana that they looked more
comfortable on the last couple of days.
They now have to go beyond fearless flex
again and see if they can get them claw
themselves back into the series. Yeah,
it's going to be interesting to see what
they're going to be pulling out in terms
of the draft. But also when we are
looking at GX particularly, it felt like
their team fights were also in a really
good position because you have the
Rumble, you have that ultimate that
brings you a lot of value and in general
lot has been doing pretty good in lane
two. He was doing really really well,
but the problem was that when the lights
go out, look at him. He's just he's 360
nocoping trying Madrid type beat.
Exactly. because it's so hard for him
because he has the most difficult job to
pretty much find ults in the fog of
four. Pretty much figuring out now with
the sweeper where the rumble ult will be
going and even though he is missing all
of these I think he's been missing two
so far he had the most damage in the
game. I feel like the game was in a very
good state because Lot has been really
really good this game. The Ramble got
huge leads over the nar kept them in the
game kept pretty much the nochun the
rakan at bay. It made it extremely hard
for um for BTS to find the engage that
they really need. Yeah, I'm really glad
that you brought up those clips of like
the complete zero vision cuz I'm not
sure I had it straight in my head until
I saw that there with the pro thinking,
well, how the hell how did you find that
as a rumble just got to freaking just
throw it into a direction. Just hope to
god that it hits someone. And luckily it
did work out eventually. But I mean his
early game did really well in lane.
Luckily later on I think that the flame
spitter with the zombies did a load of
work too. But you can see how hard it
was. And even though we praised lot
Yeah. Good one. Even though we praised a
lot for the for the great game and Jack
is sure he had the two mass build. He
was doing a lot in the late game team
fights. I feel like we need to give huge
props to Isma and to June because their
vision control has been sublime this
game. Yeah. And they're going to have to
keep it going if they want to close this
out as a 2 because again the stakes for
GX here are on the line. They need to be
able to win this to make sure that they
at least have a fighting chance. But
exactly the same thing for BDS. They do
end up choosing red side. We're ready to
head into draft. So medi do your thing.
We have a thing. It's Maddie.
It's Maddie. It's Maddie. It's Maddie.
It's Maddie. Maddie. Maddie. Dive.
How did you forget your own name? It's
been so long. It's been many years. How?
That's like four years old now. The end.
My favorite one was the elevator one.
The elevator one was great. Anyway, uh
we're going to stop doing our thing now.
We're going to instead do the actual
thing we're paid to do. Um Jex versus
BDS. The desk already highlighted the
importance of this series. GX finding
themselves a game up puts them in a
naturally very good position. We move
into the second game and we'll see what
the adaptations are. They the
interesting thing about the fearless
draft is no salty runbacks. That's true.
Which means that teams that have been
determined that the Oriana Noctturn
combo is good are now forbidden from
trying. This is why we needed it world.
Okay. Yeah. Sunsaw the Maokai and the
Jace banned away by Giant X. Nidi Yon
and Kalista banned away by BDF. Pretty
sure those are the exact same. Yeah, no
real surprises so far. Giant X. Where
are we going? Tia. Tia. So then Azir.
I don't think Azir is good into Tier at
all. Okay. I'm just saying a lot of
people like playing Azir into Tia. Not
wrong. You could go Victor, I guess, if
you wanted to. Ah, the EU special. Let's
lock in Sichuani. Then you can put an
Azir next to it. And then you uh long
range non-committal engage with some
followup. Chuck the S on top. Easy. Get
the civ down bot lane. Uhhuh. Uh-huh.
Maybe even go super old school. Put a
Jinx in there. What? It's support or
Yeah. No. AD car. Okay. Well, cuz you
already have a Civ one in Civ or Jinx.
Oh, Azir. Yeah. I said now you can put
Nun. That's the EU special. Okay. So, I
like Vi. I prefer Pantheon. I was also
thinking of Pantheon. Yeah, I like
Pantheon with Tia. I think it just makes
it super easy for you to get follow up
with the seismic shove. Uh but people
are often going to the vi mostly cuz you
know have a little bit more practice on
it. Makes a little bit more sense over
the years. Does give you a bit longer
range than the Pantheon as well, but I
think you have more side lane threat
with the Pan over the VI. Instead, Isma
will be piloting the VI once again on
the blue side for the third time this
year. or this split. He's yet to win on
it. Although that's not saying a huge
amount for Giant X because they have yet
to win on a lot of the champions that
they have played across this split. Just
kicking them while they're down medic.
They're up right now. They're one nil.
Not wrong. Yeah. And all I'm doing is
stating facts. Fious Jack's going to be
locked in for lot in the top side. This
was a champion that he did bring out in
Madrid last week to great success.
Really good series. Really good game
one. I mean, I also think his game one
was solid. Some of his Rumble alts
towards the end of the game were a bit
uh whiff, I would I guess, but uh
overall, I think he had a solid
performance. Oh, a return of the Shen.
I'm trying to think of like I think Shen
was an old school answer into Jax just
because basically when he does his uh
you just e through him, you then put the
I've forgotten all of the names.
Um, when he spins his weapon above his
head, when he uses counter strike,
counter-strike, you then put the thing
underneath you. The shrouded thing. This
is your job. Uh, I think it's something
to do with key. I'm pretty confident
it's his W. It's definitely his W. Yeah,
he So, when Jax uses E, Shen uses W. And
you're pretty uh key barrier is his
passive. Spirits refuge is his W.
Spirit's Refuge. That's the I was
getting it confused with Twilight
Shroud, which is the Akali W, obviously.
Anyway, point is, I think it can be a
decent matchup. Uh, in theory with most
Shen lanes, no one should really die.
Shen often doesn't really have that much
kill threat, but also he's a very
difficult champion to kill. Um, as we
move into the second phase, bot lane
naturally becomes the focus. Nico going
to be banned away from Jun. I think
pinching his pool makes a lot of sense
cuz when we look at Jun, Alistar and
Nico have been his two most played. Re
then rises in priority for him. We think
back to when he was on Fnatic and Re was
a champion that you really couldn't
afford to give him because of how good
he was at finding those engages. We
haven't gotten to see his Renata really
at all this year. And it was something
that was a real big powerhouse for him
when he did play for Fnatic. So, we'll
see what direction they decide to go as
the Misfortune gets taken off the board.
Will there be another AD carry ban? It
will. So, the Zia Rakan, well, there is
no Rakan anyway. So, just the Z ban
going to be directed towards Ice. It
makes sense. Zia is so good at staying
safe into things like the uh Tia into
the VI. Like getting rid of that feather
storm does reduce your capabilities a
little bit and you kind of want more
damage from your AD carry than an Ezreal
would offer you who is the other safe AD
carry cuz you just arcane shift away or
over a wall and the VI is in absolute
nia, right? So looks like BDS are going
to go instead towards the Zer. So they
are going hyper scaling. Yeah, front to
back safe scaling right now. Their only
engage is the Sichuani.
M I wonder what support. I guess Leona
is where you would think for Paris. I I
think it really depends on the matchup.
It depends how aggressive Giant X want
to go in the lane. Uh if it is something
if they pick the Leona, you could look
for something like the Nautilus into it
if you wanted to try and hook her out of
her Zenith Blades. Uh instead, Giant X
will go for the Nautilus themselves. So
likely an aggressive AD carry. A lot of
dive already. Uh Kaiser would be the
obvious one, but that was banned out by
BDS. Nautilus Lucian is not something
we've seen too commonly.
Yeah, you're right. There we go. They're
taking their time makes more sense, but
it's going to be Lucian.
Okay, it is. Yeah, I mean, I think it's
still a fine bot lane 2v2. Oh, it does a
huge amount of damage, right? You
absolutely burst someone, but uh it's
definitely uncommon. Yeah, we haven't
actually seen a Lucian at all this year
from nowhere. From nowhere. Yeah. Yeah,
cuz we did see one. We saw Nuke play it
mid and he didn't do too much. There was
also someone who played it on AD carry
this split here in EU, but I cannot
remember who the player was. I'll find
out for you. Instincts honestly, it was
hands, but I'm not entirely sure. Okay,
they're going to pair ice up with the
Paris on re so they're going to get a
little bit more engage themselves, which
I do think makes sense when suaning is
your sole engage. Uh, I don't love it
just because it's very easy to play
around, especially with Ailia on the
playing field. Now, they have a few more
options to get creative. Shen has a lot
of champions that he can potentially use
his ultimate on to assist. But
basically, the idea is GX have a lot of
single target lock down. They have a lot
of potential backline threat, whereas
BDS want to try and play this patient
frontto back style. They do have a
degree of side lane threat. I wouldn't
say that Shen is like the best side lane
champion in terms of taking towers, but
he's someone that because of his
ultimate can easily join the fight in
it. I I think the Shen is there to
neutralize the Jax's side lane threat.
I'm going to be honest. Uh I have had a
look over 2025 Vett in the LEC and I can
only see the nuke game. So it may be
that you're remembering the uh Han
Summer game from somewhere else, but it
it's also I've just Googled it, right?
So it's possible that I'm also incorrect
for Giant X. Do or die in this series.
If they win this game, they are still in
contention for the playoff spots. Tolken
Vistu. That's what that said. I hope
both teams have fun. Look guys, I'm
sorry, but I don't think the losing team
today will have had too much fun. I just
could We're at such a point in the
season that the loss just really hits
you, you know? I mean, yeah, we talked
about it earlier, but it's a situation
where for BDS, this could be their last
series of spring. I mean, it's their
last series for 3
monthsish if they lose this. And and
obviously, they then get knocked out.
They're not automatically knocked out if
they lose this series. There's still
ways they can make it through with
tiebreers. Yeah. And and for those a
little bit confused cuz the way the
schedule works, every team didn't play
every week. Yes. And then also because
of the road trips with only four teams
participating in the road trip at any
one point in time. Some teams played a
lot of games early on compared to later.
Like G2 is now like backloading a lot of
their games whereas Rogue was very
frontloaded. And so BDS, this will be
their ninth game of the regular season.
GX still have two more to go with the
potential final score line of four and
five. If BDS lose here, their final
score will be three and six, which
naturally puts them in a very precarious
position when top six are the only teams
that qualify for the playoffs. So,
there's a lot on the line. Of course, as
Medic has already highlighted, if BDX do
lose this series, it doesn't mean that
they are out of playoff contention. I
believe it's just they're playing a
tiebreaker. They would they would need a
tiebreaker to qualify. They need a
tiebreaker. They would need a tiebreaker
to qualify. So it's uh and meanwhile if
GX if now BDS win this game and then
they win out on the series then GX will
just be eliminated as will Rogue if that
happens. Uh GX and Rogue really relying
on other teams losing around them and
them getting to you know three or four
wins depending for the early laning
phase. Not really too much happening.
Jun is going to look for the hook here.
Trading in with the aftershock. you uh
if you land your hook, you're going to
avoid the CC coming out from Paris and
you get a little bit of a beneficial
trade. Lon trying to trade up towards
this top side. Both of them running
grasp. So likely see them just hitting
each other to get those grasp stacks off
early on. You expect Jackies to have
that early pryo, but N going to get
level two means that with a nice trade,
he's going to be able to push Jackis
back a little bit. Now on the bot lane,
level two secured. Yeah, nice hook
forward there. Paris is going to take
the bad side of this just defending Ice
as he jumps on towards Noah. But see
Noah can just dash forward and trade in
again with that light sllinger passive
getting those two auto attacks down.
Very nice timing there from J in the bot
lane just as he ticks over to level two
on the top side of the map. Shen doesn't
have the strongest wave clear early on.
So Lot's going to be able to get a
slight push in the top side of the map.
But across the board, Isma's getting the
luxury of playing with three pushing
lanes. Looks like he's going to leverage
that push and immediately set his sights
onto 113's blue buff. You can see Jackis
is moving with him on the mini map. He
will spot out the blue. Goes over
towards his gromp. Paris there with the
shattering strike will get the stun
down, but Isma should be able to steal
away this Gromp and maybe more as 113
walks his way down towards the bot lane.
Isma will take the grump. 113 might look
for a gank. In fact, just going through
the tri bush here as Noah and Jun do
back away.
And good use of the pryo. Just a small
advantage gained naturally, but an
advantage nonetheless. Isma wisely will
not stick around for the blue buff cuz
he realizes my laners need to go back to
the lanes and they need to get farm. So
I can't stick around any more than this
and I'll just be happy with the camp
advantage. Yeah, it would have been nice
to
take for him. Can't quite get it
instead. Just goes over to his kugs.
Irelevant
landing the taunt there does take lot
down to about 200 HP but he's going to
pop his biscuits. Recall started by
Jackie unlet completed cuz Nuke walked
around the corner. 113 is on his way
across here as well as Nuke glides
forward. Jackie's holding on to that
flash and doesn't need to burn it. Very
nice damage there from Nuke. He will get
a nice push in this midwave. 113 can
also help a little bit given that Nuke
is very low on mana.
TP just going to come through from
Jackie. So not the end of the world.
Another hook onto Paris who jumps away.
Noah trading back in onto Ice. It's good
trading overall from Noah and Jun. Not
getting too much of a lead though. You
can see actually Ice and Paris if they
catch this wave will be about equal in
terms of CS. But more resources
available to Noah and
Jun. A popped health potion and double
biscuits still on Noah. So he'll be
happy enough if these trades continue.
Seismic shock coming up onto Nuke as
Jackie's got back into the lane first
with his own teleport. So was ready and
waiting for Nuke to arrive. TP going to
be used top lane. Double Ruby Crystal
picked up for irrelevant. And now that
top lane match up will very much just
become a well exactly what you're seeing
on your screen. Just one champion trades
once, the other champion trades again.
This time the irrelevant does win
out. But yeah, top lane is is top lane
that it is buddy. Let's see.
the Twilight Assault buffs obviously
helping Shen a little bit. That's his Q,
but uh nothing too consequential. Just
pushes him into a position where he can
survive and trade effectively in a lot
of these matchups where in the past he
would really get hammered down in the
top lane and then would struggle a
little bit more. Leap strike away from
Lot as he just wants to get this wave
crashed in towards Ire. One of the risks
now for Giants X is irrelevant is about
to stick over to six about half a level
away and lot doesn't have teleport so he
won't be able to join a fight if uh it
does begin and obviously stand united
from irrelevant will let him get across
there quicker. Jun here almost
perafrosted steps forward. Ice coming in
from the bottom side of the fight around
that draisma should just be able to
smite this one and then bolt breaker
over the wall. Flash forward from Paris.
Cleanse away from Noah and now Paris is
on the wrong side of the rift. The nuke
slides in with the emperor of fight by
two. Jack is the first spawn. Jun
ignited as well as the stand. United
comes in to save Paris. They will manage
to do so. Jun dies. Ice is the one to
pick up the kill. BDS with a good glide
in from Nuke and a good ultimate from a
relevant win out on the fight. BDS
that's first on the board though. Paris
was very close to losing his life after
Jackie's used an absolutely beautiful
I always forget the name of this one
unraveled earth. It is my kryptonite. So
you'll see the engage come through. The
dragon gets secured and then as the
engage comes through this unraveled
earth prevents 113 from being able to
follow up. So he hesitates but Nuke is
the one that finds an angle over the
wall. uses his E to glide into the
backline, connects the ultimate onto two
members and allows BDS to swing this
early skirmish in their favor. Ice
having to commit his flash. It's
obviously not ideal for him, but he does
secure a kill of his own, upgrading to
the Zurka's Greaves. Yeah, nice united
as well from irrelevant just to save
Paris in the end. It was possible that
Jackis would have been able to get the
kill. He was kind of being bounced
around the back of the team fight, but
don't want to risk giving that first
blood over towards the Tia. still has a
slight gold lead over Nuke who only
picked up two assists in the trade.
Meanwhile, we see the swaps going up
towards the top side. Isma's going to
steal away this red buff and look for
the Kugs as well. 113 smited them. Still
not level six. I relevant now having to
deal with two players in his lane. Lot
trying to hold the wave here. Is going
to get stunned up with the shadowing
strike, but then pops the counter strike
and it's all okay. Managed to pick up
that minion as well. So, he's fine
farming underneath this tower. drops up
in 30 seconds time and advantage in
terms of numbers at least on the map at
the top side to Giant X. I imagine the
swap is now going to come through. You
can see both irrelevant and ice
based cuz 113 comes across. There's the
glacial prison. There's the follow up.
Jackie is dead. Didn't respect the fact
that BDS could collapse. Paris will
survive with the crash down shield.
Minion auto attack not enough to finish
him off. pot helping him out a little
bit there. But yeah, Nuke, he had to
glide in with his E to get in range to
spawn another soldier which then stunned
himself up underneath the tower and then
it got a little bit awkward for a
second. But they did find themselves
another kill. So that's three now on the
board. This will be another objective
conceded though in the early game. Isma
having a similar performance to game one
where he was securing all of the early
dragons and all of the grubs which kind
of put BDS in that awkward position of
constantly having to fight for the soul.
Yeah, the game's actually gone very
similarly to game one. Like BDS getting
a few early kills, especially 113
getting ahead in the jungle match up.
Lot is massively ahead in the top lane
and Giant X have got the early
objectives. So very similar to how we
saw game one happening here. I guess
Jackie is a little bit further behind
than he was in game one and as in game
one he was able to get a bit of a lead
on that Akali early doors, but only
about a 600 gold lead between the two
teams as of now. Importantly for Ice, he
has managed to pick up that kill. It's
about 10 CS up and on the Zi is
beginning to scale. Yeah. So, this is
where things become a problem for GX
because I think that BDS just scale
better. Azeri is perennial. Is that the
right word? Yeah, perennial a perennial
late game comp, right? And the whole
idea is that you use your range to play
behind a wall. And in this case, your
wall is real, Satani, and Shen. and you
uh and you just hit damage and you hope
that they can't hit you. And the thing
is if the VI goes in, sure you sit there
and think, "Wow, this can be a problem."
But then there's Sichuani wall uh sorry,
there's the Azia wall, there is the Shen
ultimate, there's a lot of tools to just
help protect um the backline of BDS. So,
as long as they can just play the team
fights well, which I think this roster
has showcased they are capable of doing,
being in a neutral state this early on
is is a great position to be in. Yeah,
it's also Ice on his second most played
champion throughout his career. He has a
62% win rate on this Zer very
comfortable on it. Lot trading with
irrelevant still shadow dash forward
from irrelevant. Doesn't quite land the
taunt and Lot goes in with the grand
masters might hit. Should be able to
kill off irrelevant. Irele using that
key barrier passive relatively
effectively. So I think Lot was more
trying to get irrelevant low so he could
make sure this wave crashes in. But it
looks like he has just given up the
ghost on that one and will back away.
Problem is the wave can now be frozen by
irrelevant. Of course, lot has been
building a nice CS lead of his own, but
I guess he has the TP, so he can just TP
back onto the minion wave. Force Irele
underneath his tower. Looks like that's
exactly what he's going to do. So now
the Vi hovering around the bot side of
the map. Dragon going to be spawning in
15 seconds. And remember that Irele
actually hasn't had an opportunity to
base yet. So Lock can keep the pressure
up on this bot side with a health
advantage, with an item advantage. They
can push in the midway, which is exactly
what they're going to do. They can set
themselves up for the third objective of
the game.
Breaker out from Isma. I thought he was
going to start it up. There's the recall
from Irelevant. Immediately TPS down
towards the bottom lane. Hook onto Ice,
but just around the corner. Ice playing
behind the wall, although not the one we
expected. Isma goes in onto 113. Seduani
has the glacial prison, but isn't going
to throw it out. Really waiting for
irrelevant to get the push out in that
bottom side. Both Nuke and Jackie have
the opportunity to move with their
teleports. Jackie's actually had begun
working his way down the river. The rock
surfing obviously gives him a little bit
more movement speed if he does want to
just run his way down there instead.
Nuke now the one in the fog of war. Jun
on the front line. There's the TP in as
Jackis is going to join the play. Paris
goes forward. Isma dashing in onto him
and no will pick up the kill. Giant X on
the board. Should be able to take the
drake as well. Bit of a disconnect there
from BDS as Paris goes in as 113 is
dashing out. Yeah, Paris was ready to
follow up on that engage. Didn't quite
tick over to level six, which would have
been a valuable ultimate to have and
that enclosed space. But remember Nuke,
he was walking down rather than
threatening to TP while they do get that
TP out from Jackie. Ultimately GX secure
themselves their first kill of the game
and they're going to get another dragon
as well. So GX, even though they find
themselves down in kills, the gold is
largely even. I think a lot of that is
because of the top lane difference, but
in terms of itemization, there's nothing
significant separating the two. Nothing
too massive between the two teams. It
does feel like we're going to get a soul
point/ soul fight as Lot pops the grand
masters might here just to walk away
from irrelevant will be able to do so.
Wave should be shoved in by the time he
gets back. But it it definitely feels
like it's a third fourth dragon fight.
Decided game, right? If Giant X get the
third dragon and get the fourth dragon,
then we're we're pushing to the point of
well, BDS don't have the time to scale
into a position they can actually fight
back. An interesting TP here from Nuke
down towards the bottom side. I think
what this is doing is just funneling
more plate gold into him, saying we
would prefer our to get ahead. The only
other thing it could be is he's worried
that he's going to get dived dived in
the top lane. Rather just TP bot,
knowing that Jackis doesn't have the TP
and they have no intention of using the
TP in the immediate future. I get that.
So I think it's like a combination of
both where if they want anyone to lose
gold, they'd rather have irrelevant. And
this is irrelevant. Flashes underneath
the tower. There's the hook follow up
into the side. Shove the unraveled earth
doing work here as a relevant doesn't
get an opportunity to move. Jun gets the
kill. Meanwhile, BDS are pushing mid and
bot. Noah forced away from the tower.
BDS don't have the grubs on their side,
so we'll only be able to pick up two
plates. Start to path down towards the
bottom side. 113 looking to see perhaps
if Lot over steps. There's a goddamn
bounty council in the top side is
irrelevant. He got thrown around as
three members of GX committed to getting
that kill. They're closing that kill gap
rapidly and Jackie is being given a ton
of isolated plates in the top lane as
well. The gold difference not really too
significant in the mid lane match up,
but GX slowly but surely getting into a
much better position here in game two. I
mean, a few minutes ago it was blue at
the top of the scoreboard and then red
red. And now it's going to swing into
blue, blue, blue, one red, one blue,
right? It's it's a good sequence of
events for Giants X picking up the
kills. Now 1,700 gold ahead because of
the plates because of that first tower
up towards the top side. You can see BDS
just lacking a little bit over the last
couple of minutes. Lot constantly adding
pressure on the side lane. Needs to be a
little bit cautious if he does overstep
here. You can see that developments
working his way across. But in the end,
it's really about whether or not Giant X
can use this small early lead and
actually take the game away from BDS cuz
Nukes already is first item. Yals is
complete for ice. EDS are scaling and
two well probably three items that I
will say they've outscaled Giant X. All
other things being
E. We'll see how things transpire.
BDS was happy if the game state remained
neutral, but it wasn't. Like GX is being
super proactive. You can say what you
want about Isma this split, but right
now in this series, he has been nothing
but objective focused. He's securing
these early um leads in a sense. It's
not in terms of gold, but in terms of
map pressure for his team. Rift Herald
now alive, and it's Jex that find
themselves in position once more. We
wall in from Jackis. Paris has to crash
down out. Importantly, there's a
standing unit available to irrelevant.
Teleport is up for lot. So lot's going
to jump in and constantly try and trade
on irrelevant here. Just get him low
enough that if he does get in with the
stand united, he might fall pretty
sharpish
afterwards. Looks like L is going to
base. Already has that Triforce
complete. Jackie with a seismic shove
onto Paris. The headlash forward and
Paris is down before the stand. United
can even be used. Giant X now. Once
again, eyes on the prize. This objective
will be theirs. It's another pick. It's
another objective secured for GX.
They've been doing this so consistently
in this game, punishing these isolated
members of
BDS and converting it into something
more. Now BDS are looking for a play of
their own. There's two on the top side.
Oh, Nuke slides in. Jackie flashes away
from the embers of Glacial Prison going
wide. TP invested as well. A little bit
eager there from Lock immediately
jumping to the defense of his mid laner,
but wasn't needed in the end. So, a few
summoners burnt ahead of the dragon
spawning in 40 seconds. 113 and N
unlikely to have their ultis available.
Jack is of course losing his flash, but
in exchange for the junglers, definitely
not the worst trade ever. Jax will be
able to I think they're hoping to
complete those second items. You can see
Jackie is so close to the Leandre's. If
he can get that ahead of the next fight,
he'd be in a great position. That'd be a
lovely spike to fight
on in a similar
vein. Drake up in 10 seconds time. It's
Hex Soul for Giant X as well. They'll be
very happy with that. There was a risk.
It was Ken and that I think would have
put a little bit of a spanner in the
works for them. Rift now beginning her
charge down this mid lane. No one in the
bot side for BDS answering the push from
Irelevant. Nuke up towards the top side.
Lot goes in with the counter-strike.
Another hook's going to go down. There's
the stand. United charge though. Follow
up and 113's already down. Irrelevant
dashes in with the taunt, but he's
locked up for days again. And he's
forced away with the culling. BDS have
lost their jungler. Giant X to just walk
away. GX, they get the tower, they get
the kill that makes securing the dragon
that much easier. And similar to game
one, GX put themselves on sole point.
They've proven so far in this series
that their early game can be very clean.
They've managed their side lanes
well and GX I mean I don't know what
happened to them in Madrid, but they
have definitely continue to ramp up.
While there's definitely a few mistakes
in the mid game, this is not the same GX
that we saw at the beginning of spring.
Oh, this early game is so much better
than what we've come to expect from
them. On average, they are 500 gold
behind at the 15minute mark. They don't
usually take the first tower. They don't
usually get first blood. They don't
usually win when they're ahead. And
Jackie is not usually caught out on a
side lane. He's going to die to a
meanwhile in the top side. Lock has been
caught out by Paris and Nuke. And just
as we praise them, Giant X begin to fall
apart. Isma chasing 113 down here. Vault
breaker in Jun looking for the dredge
line, but 113 steps to the side of it.
BDS going to get a lot on the map while
this chase continues. And as we enter
the mid game is when we start to see the
chaos unfold. BDS typically a pretty
wise macro team. When we think back to
last year when Nuke and the original BDS
roster was playing around the map, it
was in these positions where they find
these punishers. A pick on the top side
of the map. A pick on the bot side. Two
quick kills in favor of BDS. They secure
two towers as well. And now the gold
deep. And just like that, the gold is
even. And that's why this series has
been nothing but a nailbiter as both
teams fight back and forth for that spot
to that ever so tight spot for playoffs.
Yeah, if Giant X lose this, remember
they are eliminated alongside Rogue from
the road to playoffs for BDS. They can
still make it even if they lose, but
would be reliant on
tiebreers rather than anything
else. Isma looking for something across
the wall here. Still three and a half
minutes before the next dragon, so we've
got a while to wait on that. Two items
complete now on Nuke. Leandre's Nash's
tooth is in an incredibly powerful spot
as this Azir lot trying to chase
irrelevant away. Irelevant with the
Titanic Hydra lot taunted up and as you
can see you can just walk away from the
counter-strike in the duration of the
taunt. The counterstrike
expires defending the bot lane tier one.
Betty or just the blue buff perhaps?
Looks like the blue buff is the name of
the game. I think BDS the thing that
they would love to get rid of is that
mid tier one but give them so much more
access to the map which GX is quite
adamant and not conceding. Noah has
remained steadfast in the mid lane to
continue the push and Ice wisely
respects the potential collapse. He
stays safely underneath his tower and
waits for the wave to come to him.
Sometimes you got to do that, you know.
Yeah. Can't you don't want to overstep
in a game like this can just be decided
by a single overstep. Ice now has the
runands complete. Attra has spawned at
that 20 minute mark. Giant X have set up
a little bit of vision around this, but
Jun doesn't have as much vision as he'd
like. Stunned up with the perafrost.
There's the chase to continue. Paris
looking for the engage. Jun flashes
away. Can't get to the honey fruit.
Can't get to any extra HP. So, he's just
going to have to use the hex gates to
get back out of base. No vision now for
Giant X around there. Ice caught out
with the cease and desist though. Stand
united immediately coming in. Lightning
crash and flash gets him out just about
alive. The taunt in by irrelevant onto
Isma. Jackie's chasing forward here and
lock coming in from the side as well.
Vreaker charge by Isma. Magnus storm
onto Noah. Isma flashes away. 113 full
thirst and Jackie is on the chase.
Another counter strike a double stun.
Noah dashes forward cleanses away from
Paris's knockup immediately. Ire down as
well. Paris able to walk away and Ice
coming back out of base sees his team in
tatters. GX convert that small skirmish
into a massive team fight win killing
multiple BDS members and converting it
into another. The collapse was swift
from GX as Ice did everything he could
to get away. He was able to survive just
barely thanks to the Shen ultimate that
came through. But we talked about how
dangerous it was to move away from the
safety of the mid lane. He commits the
flash. He gets away. But now BDS see
this as an angle to collapse. But the
Tia ultimate combined with the TP coming
through from lock means that now BDS is
getting collapsed from multiple sides. A
good idea from Paris to lock down Noah.
But there's no followup which means that
it just becomes a frontto back affair
with no AD carry on the side of BDS
allowing for GX to just mow down the
targets one by one.
Giant X playing on multiple fronts. get
that 3,000 gold lead back. 40 seconds on
the drake. In terms of summoners,
there's only a couple of flashes
available in the entire game. 113 and
Nuke have theirs. The Emperor's Divide.
The glacial prison both up as well.
Coming up on either team just in time
for this fight. The seismic shot back
onto Paris. He tries to jump away. The
Counter Strike finds two again and 113
has to flash the wall and pops the
glacial prison as well. Lot on the back
line. Isma going in. Lot dive forward.
Death charge. Luke's going to fall
first. Lot's on the chase. Another
seismic shove connects and giant text
just wipe away BDS. Things are so
quickly falling apart for BDS as GX go
from one good fight into another. That
is an ace in favor of Giants. And now
with 12 to six in kills with the dragon
available. They're looking to secure the
soul. A 6,000 gold lead as well. Two
tier 2's off the push. Giant X. Those
last two fights absolutely sublime.
They'll take the hex soul. Baron's still
a little while away. Let's have another
look at this fight. We see the engage
initially come through onto Paris. He
gets absolutely melted. And again, it's
a situation where BDS is just
disconnected on how they want to play
the fight. Great target selection from
Isma as he locks down Nuke. Jackis finds
a way into the backline, which means
that Nuke has to use his ultimate
defensively. And when BDS is so spread
out like this and J can use the
individual power of their composition,
they pick apart BDS and they win a
massive fight. Yeah, huge credit to
Jackis as well. A couple of really solid
seismic shelves in the middle of that to
get people back into the fight who may
have just escaped. Ice right on the edge
of it, but now Giant X unwilling to get
out, get knocked out of playoffs without
a fight are putting up a bit of a
stormer here. Hexol for them. 23 minutes
in Betty. Very rapid securing of all of
those dragons. Two items complete on
Noah. Jackie's and on Lot Lot has the
seekers here as well. You can see
Giantex beginning to push up through
this top side. Sand United available to
irrelevant. I think BDS would be hoping
they have two Shen instead of just the
one in this game. Lot pushes forward
looking for that demolish pop. Pops the
counter strike again. Seismic shove back
onto Paris again. And again, Paris falls
first. The stand united not enough.
Another hook. Emperor Divide. Lock
flashes past it. Noah gets the double.
There's one minion here for Giant X. The
Might won't be enough to take the tower
for now, but already they've got two
kills and it's all on ice to try and
defend. GX are just relentless with
their aggression. They're not giving BDS
a window to breathe as they continue
their siege. Two quick picks into
another tower.
The last line of defense for BDS are
their inhibitor towers, but Baron is
spawning just in time for GX. They can
immediately turn their attention to
this. And now it becomes a question of
can 113 find a steal. I mean, the small
risk here for Giant X is starting up
immediately. You haven't set your vision
line as clearly as you'd like it to be.
Don't have any vision, just over the
back of the pit. The vision you had
deeper was cleared out by BDS
immediately. And because Giant X realize
it, they back away as soon as they see
BDS coming through their jungle. The hex
gates make it too hard to immediately do
that baron. So we'll have another look
at the fight towards the top side cuz
again it's Paris getting caught with a
seismic shell and you mentioned it
earlier. Jackie is just finding some
great knock backs consistently
throughout this game. He finds the knock
back onto Paris. A good flash from lot
wasn't necessarily needed cuz another
knock back came through from Jackie. He
just sets up the picks for his team and
they extend the gold lead to 8k. Now the
main objective being this baron GX. Of
course, you always have to be cautious
when starting this objective. You don't
want to run the risk of giving the
opponent jungler that opportunity to
steal it
away. But this game does feel like a
foregone conclusion. Of course, we've
seen many throws from these positions
before. Why have you said it? I will not
throw away the possibility, but GX is in
such a commanding position and it is a
much needed performance for them as they
wish to keep their playoff hopes alive.
They're doing exactly what they need to
do.
keeping BDS on the ropes in this game,
getting themselves two, three wins. They
have one more series against Heretics at
the end of the regular season to try and
get to that elusive four. Usually four
wins is at least tiebreaker, if not just
into the playoffs. Expect it to be a
tiebreaker this time and keep their fate
kind of in their own hands a little bit.
Baron begun by Giant X. BDS one solitary
ward past basically the entrances to
their jungle. Unable to get any vision
on it. Isma and Noah just mowing through
this baron right now. BDS will be there
but they'll be way too late. Baron
secured by Giant X. The smite comes out
now. Isma was waiting to see if he
needed to engage. Doesn't need to. They
have two synced waves here. It looks
like bot and mid for Giant X. Jackie
still looking to see if he can chip away
at Ice. And we have a
pause. I believe it was from BDS's
side. We'll see exactly what the cases
obviously as soon as we can find once we
have more information naturally. We will
share it with you. Yeah, the pause did
come through from uh PDS's sides.
There's a sign in the crowd that says,
"I'm here for switching lanes." Okay.
Well, okay. Is he switching lanes? Mhm.
Uh, right now they'll need to because
they have a Baron and they'd want to
play through two lanes rather than one.
You could just play through one and kill
the could potentially do that. I'm
seeing ready checks. Oh, nice. Yeah.
Doesn't that happen before the show?
See, it literally says game is resuming
shortly. Oh, nice. Live updates live as
opposed to the live updates that you get
after time. Correct. Or premonition
updates which sometimes we get every now
and again. Looks like we are jumping
back on into the game. The baron push
continues for Giant X. BDS trying to
defend on two fronts. The next wave for
Giant X in the bot lane a little bit
away. They'll go for the inhibitor
first. BDS at some point have to pull
the trigger here. I mean, you can sack
two inhibs, but becomes a very tricky
road to walk back. Lot steps forward
with the counter strike. Irrelevant
going to dash away with the shadow dash
hook. 113 going forward. There's the
Magnus. A great engage from BDS, but
they don't have any damn damage. Ice
wasn't there. He's knocked back. He'll
dash away. The lightning crash not doing
enough. Ice locked up. Giant X wipe away
BDS and keep their playoff hopes alive
in convincing fashion. They will close
out this series and they will keep the
playoff dreams alive as they shut down
BDS.
It was a long time coming for Giant X
until Madrid. They only had one win,
then a victory versus G2. A close series
versus
Morcoy, and now a win versus BDS. The
question is, will the gods smile upon
them? Will it all come down to that
series against Heretics on the final day
of the split? Yeah, there's a lot on the
line, but the league just got a whole
lot more tense. Oh, it got a whole lot
more tense. Are they all jacking for
position?
Okay. Are you going to leave like Noah
or what are you going to say? You can
vote for your key player of the series.
Lot, Jackies, or Noah. All great
options. I do want to give a big shout.
Those are all the options. It's
Yeah. I I do want to give a big shout
out to Isma. His early game object is my
jungler in the nominees. He is not, but
his jungle control in the early game was
spectacular. The objective focus that he
had, uh, the way he played around
pressure was very clean. and given how
much criticism he's had throughout the
split. I think that uh he really did
step up in this game and he was a
massive contributor to the success of GX
in this series. So, huge credit to him
and the team. They're looking good. As
you rightly said, they've got one series
left and it's now really in Fate's hands
for BDS. They're looking for a
tiebreaker to stay alive to be able to
compete. Yeah, importantly, no series
left for BDS. That was their final
series in the regular season. So, we'll
see if they can find that tiebreaker
from somewhere. It will rely on a lot of
results going in their favor because
they're currently only at three wins.
Three and six is where they end up. But
the fiveway tie is still alive with
winning that. And obviously it's a
disappointing way for BDS to end their
split. They're not going to be happy
with it. Um but now
Destiny is out of their hands and
they're going to have to rely on the
results of the remaining games. Jex
though elated after finding some much
neededed wins over the last two weeks.
And that final series, they're in
control of their own destiny in a lot of
ways. There may still be some tiebreaker
situations even if they do win. I
haven't looked through all of the
permutations on my because even four
wins because of the whole standing
situation and what plays out they might
not even be safe even if they do win. So
it's not an easy road for them. Um but
if nothing else LC is going to be a wild
ride. Uh it is with the remaining game
today games tomorrow and next weekend as
well. Yeah those being played in Paris
obviously. Yes they will be for the
first two days and then we'll be back
here on the Monday in the studio for for
Giant X. The curse seems to be broken
ready. They beat G2. Finally broke the
guillotto curse of G2 won't make worlds.
And now back to winning ways. It took
him a while to ramp up this fight, but
hopefully they can continue this form. I
can see Shocks standing behind us with
Noah with Guillotto. I don't know if
she's ready. She can wave towards the
camera. Oh, she's ready. Let's go,
Shocks. Take it away.
Thank you so much. They're already
talking about the game. They can't wait.
I mean, I would as well. No problem.
Welcome to the Marriott Bonvoy postgame
check-in with Guilloto and with Noah.
First up, congratulations you two um
after Madrid. It's nice to get another
victory on the board. Now, the first
thing I want to bring up is that um
there is a difficult situation in that
uh we saw that you wearing the band and
I was wondering if there was anything
you both wanted to say towards that.
my
uh my grandfather passed away three days
ago.
So, but still I'm here. Yeah, I came to
Korea. So
[Applause]
Alen I'm nearly happy to win because
it's okay now. It's okay.
you okay?
[Applause]
Yeah, work is work. So, I'm happy to our
team in and we can make playoffs. But
yeah,
thank you Noah out of of course I get
it. This is a difficult moment but you
get the victory also in spirit for him
and I think Guyoto can you tell us a
little bit about then the challenges of
uh this is a situation you navigate as a
team right and the fact that you were
able to bring it home into a victory
today in this allimp important race for
playoffs. Uh I mean obviously the the
win is very important but uh I mean I I
I told Noah to me today we we just
wanted similar to to Madrid but now with
obviously an extra purpose. We just want
to play each game in a way where we can
leave proud and then if we don't make it
to playoffs, we just want to be able to
be happy with the way that we play. And
uh preparation for this week, obviously
it's it's extremely hard and and to me
family is always is always above, but I
think Noah was an absolute warrior. Um
gave his best every every scream. So
obviously it just feels even much better
to to win just to to make sure that uh
this can be attached to the to the
memory of his grandfather. Yeah,
absolutely. Noah, is there anything you
want to say about how you performed as a
team today and have since Madrid where I
feel like you know you are improving
every single day and it is commendable
knowing now what you had to go through
in terms of playing here this weekend.
Uh I mean I think after Madrid I think
our team is finally can show our
performance staging. So I just wanted to
keep it and yeah I think today even I
played worse. I think we our team played
really well. So I'm proud of them.
Absolutely. That's why you have a team
at the end of the day. Kyoto. Is there
anything that you want to lift out that
has stood out to you the last couple of
weeks that your team has really took on
board and that has netted these
victories? Uh I mean to me it's just the
fact that we were able to to still have
a good mood even though our results were
were not satisfactory as well. I think
that more than myself this group of
players put a lot of effort in that and
and they thrive on on those
environments. So so to me just the fact
that everyone is still able to come to
an office with their hopes up and um
with a lot of willingness to to learn
and do better and especially to have fun
I think was is the key that is making us
perform. But obviously we still achieved
nothing. I think we are still at the
bottom of the barrel. Uh so next week we
have another final and if we win that
our chances I I actually I don't even
know what our chances if we depend on
someone or or not but probably but all
you can do is look ahead. Yeah. But but
for us we just want to win regardless of
anything and that's kind of the mindset
that we are having and going to work
every day with with these five players
and and the the three coaches that I
have has just been very good because
when you are on these lows that's when
you really see uh what you're made of.
And I don't know, it's just really,
really nice. Yeah, it is. Uh,
congratulations on that part. Noah,
you're also voted by everyone as our Kia
player of the series. So, I think
Yeah, I mean, that definitely makes you
probably feel good that it's like a big
hug from all all the viewers and
everybody to you. So, congratulations
for that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank
you so much for talking to us. Um GX
they managed to keep themselves and
Rogue in the playoffs. We're going to
head over to a quick break, but when we
come back it is our match of the week of
G2 versus Vital.
[Music]
[Music]
Wait, is he switching
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
lanes? Huh?
Red Bull gives you wings.
Victory.
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
NL
Down up down.
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
Woo! I have
The feel.
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I don't feel you.
[Music]
I mean G2 I'm excited to play. We
haven't played them on stage yet. So I
want to see how like Lava plays on
stage. Usually with G2 is like when they
play bad they come back very strong.
Linds flashes in but his sent away. Hey,
that's ulti. But finally, Nesquick, not
just a good looking drink. He looks
freaking amazing on Nico as well. I have
no idea. I mean, I thought the game is
like kind of lost, but then finally did
something after running it down, you
know, the entire game. So, I was pretty
happy about this engage that he found.
I mean, yeah, we came back. I mean, I
did one good flash and then we kind of
won the game. That's usually how these
matchups go, right? So, I definitely
have a lot of trust in G2 and I think
they have always shown a lot of good
progress and we have aligned a lot with
our goals. So, I think we obviously
didn't quite make it all the way in in
winter, but I think we have learned a
lot since then and I know that we have
all put in a lot of work to not have
that happen again. And I'm just excited
to play the rest of the split and
hopefully prove that we are a team that
can compete for for the world
championship. That's the engage kicking
things off. Razer manages to find his
target, but it's only the Ezreal al to
follow. Now, the buy deleted. The Maai
Alt beautifully splits up the fight. All
of Fnatic taken out.
Welcome to the match of the week, G2
versus Vitality and our Marriott Bonvoy
pregame check-in with Broken Blade.
Broken Blade, a really important day and
I think it's been a while that you had
such big stakes. I think domestically in
EU being that you lost three best of
threes in in a row which is fairly
unique I want to say in G2's history. So
how is the team how did you recuperate
after Madrid? Um I we definitely had a
tough week uh tough three series but uh
I feel like we had a very very good
conclusion. We had a very good talk and
I mean people know G2 we always come
back fighting and I think today is going
to be the day where we come back
fighting and show up. So I'm very
excited. I'm very excited of what we can
show today.
um excited at what me and my team uh you
know just how we perform today. I'm I'm
I'm very eager to show that we are still
here. You know, G2 is still here to
still to to contest the the trophy. So
yeah, for sure. I think as whenever I
ask you a question, you're always very
cognizant of answering in terms of the
we the team which I think is very
important, but I do want to turn it a
bit on your personal performance as well
because I feel like you were probably
you left some things on the rift in
Madrid that you wanted to show better. I
can assume also from a personal
perspective and it seems like the things
that came natural to you and the rest of
the team communication wise and engage
wise last year don't seem to entirely
all be there. Do you have a similar read
and and how do you combat that? I mean
there's definitely uh I mean a change of
like what kind of champions are being
played and for me individually obviously
I'm always looking to to you know what I
can do better in in these games and I
mean thankfully for me and my team I
feel like we are very open with each
other in terms of like what we can do
and I can do better uh and that goes for
every single person on the team. So
obviously that's something I've been
working on um just to be uh you know
always looking to perform the best and
today is hopefully one of those days.
Okay. What do you think about people's
opinions on your Yasuo? I mean, my Yasu
took out one of the greatest supplements
in the world, so I don't really listen
to those opinions. I know it's good. I
like it. Finally, Vitality now. They had
they kind of got away with murder um
with the Niski engaged last week. What
do you think their the biggest
challenges are in terms of playing them?
Uh I mean the biggest challenge for me
is to to take Niski serious when I see
him on spot ro. I played against him a
lot. So seeing him on the sport is going
to be something very different. Uh also
I I I like to play against Nagnako is
he's also Turkish. So I want to play
well against him. Uh but overall I think
they have they have their own style. You
know I from for us coming from 03 lose
streak it's going to be a good match to
showcase that you know we can we can
bounce back and I think Vital is a good
opponent for that. Uh because we have to
prove ourselves you know they are not
just a random team to beat. They are
playing well. So excited for it. Okay.
But staying humble at the same time, you
know. Yeah. Yeah. I know. You're always
humble and excited. And so are we. Thank
you very much. Thank you.
The the biggest challenge is taking
Niski seriously. This guy like went in.
But the thing is he's right. You they
have to do really well against Vitality.
because they have to prove themselves,
but this is also your playoff spot to an
extent having to lock a chance to play a
tiebreaker. So, there's two things here.
It's the playoffs spot to get a
tiebreaker minimum, but at the same
time, he did say it himself. They had
talks and teams like G2, the really top
teams that are always contenders for the
title, when they hit these sort of speed
bumps, they hit the wall, they, you
know, had the talk, they, how to say,
they bounce back from it. So now it's
especially important because now you get
to see what the talk was about. How do
you put it into practice? Did it work?
Did you get the right conclusions? And
if it's not, then you have to go back to
a drawing board. And I don't know if you
can do it back to back like that. And
zeroing in on something that you just
said about bouncing back there. Vitality
have already had to do that. For those
of you who didn't see at the start of
the day, we had a big graphic of like
the wins and losses in a big line for
each team. Vitality had like a giant
canyon from the 02s that they had back
to back. They've already come back from
that. And I think that G2 cannot rest on
Laurels at all. They must get back to
form soon because Vitality, they're
looking, you know, some bumps aside,
looking really like they have a really
good ceiling. Yeah, it's not just the
fact that Vitality has a really good
ceiling. It's also when you're looking
at G2 here and the fact that there is a
world that we currently live in where
they're not going to be in playoffs if
they don't lock in today. They don't
have time anymore. They can't wait until
they're playing in the arena against KC
where they're going to have the KC fans
also shouting at them. It's like for G2
like it's today or maybe they're not
even in playoffs. Exactly. Because I'm
looking at BB. I'm looking at BB the
decision that he's making um every time
we look at G2 is he's the player in the
top was always him in caps and other
people bouncing to it. And now he needs
to prove it today. Yeah. And they're
going to prove it hopefully on the rift,
but also Vitality has a lot to prove as
well with Niski on that support whether
or not they're going to be able to make
this first game sweat. Let's head over
to our casters because we're ready to
head into the match of the week.
Hell yeah, we are. Match of the week. Oh
my god. G2 Vitality fighting for their
playoff lives. Nothing sealed today, but
the fact we're at this sport, this spot
rather with a team like G2 and Vitality
climbing up that hill. It's impressive
to say the least and it should be good
sport as well. I think this is going to
be an absolute banger. It feels like
Vitality like these individual
performers really stepping up. I think
Chai had that great performance on the
Tia. Those walls were fantastic. And now
if you can try and have that performance
here against Caps today, that could be
something. But we've also got the the
Turkish Tussle in the top side of the
map as well that I think a lot of people
will be keeping their eyes on. Yeah. I
mean, didn't you guys see when you
telling me that [ __ ] looked up to
Broker Blade that there was this a real
respect for what is the goat of the top
lane in this league? And that was the
thing. So we were chatting to him kind
of before Euphoria started and very much
the discussion was Naknako backing
broken blade for the best top laner that
we have in the league. Maybe if Kana
gets chased it might be a little bit
different but you go definitely has
looked up to broken blade has kind of
been that inspiration and I said look
this is the first time he's ever faced
off against them. So he's uh looking
forward to learning from uh from the
master himself. Although in the bathroom
he did tell me they were going to look
into a shogi shogath which luckily can't
happen but make me a little bit more
disappointed. You know I love that
bathroom inside. Let's see what else
gets taken off. Y so far seems like a
good bet for G2 since even Nako has
played it so far on the side of
Vitality. That Maai stable jungler still
in 259 here in the LEC. Kalista still
not getting through that much and this
seems like the usual although taking
away the Kaiser here seems a little bit
ambitious in game one. The bars I assume
is going to be the the final ban. So I
imagine you go Varys ban they're looking
at a Ezreal pick up for Han Sama cuz
that's kind of the answer I would
imagine a lot of the times for that
Kai'Sa and we've also seen Vi start to
kind of teeter up in the priority list
as well because you can open up for a
lot of the you know the Vi rumbles these
kind of plays. So I am curious as to
what G2 want to try and go for here.
call out though that ban taken away as
you said the range taken off the board a
bit ty has been worth a mention
especially with setup of these comps we
know how many good junglers are pairing
with strong midlaners at the moment
Dagda it does feel like for caps I mean
he's played a lot of the he's played a
lot of champions who split but sits high
amongst amongst most of them yeah we've
kind of seen giant go back towards
things like the azir in this sort of
situation it only really seems to be
caps who's trying to opt in towards the
funer picks like the way into the tier
to try and outrange in the matchup but I
don't think we get it here. And
honestly, I could just see the Rumble
and then a jungle lock in here as well.
Pantheon makes a lot of sense. A very
strong pot and dirty game jungler. Nice
water bottles. Good branding for
Vitality. Knuck also leaning back on his
chair. It's going to be hard to grab
that water bottle in the midst of the
game, but we'll keep you updated to see
how long his arms can reach. The
Pantheon you already talked about locked
in. Let's see pairings here because
again for Lindes, I love him on these
aggressive junglers. the Nefiri, the
Pantheon, his most played. And so far,
we've not been disappointed with when
Lynn just gets a lead, he does take over
the game with picks like this as Jace,
that also helps. Wow. Okay, so I agree
with the Pantheon pick cuz like the last
time you think about him playing it was
the MO series where he had that game one
where he just popped off at five and
zero the first few minutes of the game.
So definitely a champion he's looked
very comfortable on. The Jace surprises
me. Not that I don't think Nakaco has it
in his wheelhouse. I just thought it
would be a bit more like we'll go
towards the Rumble, go towards something
a bit more basic cuz this is kind of
just a call out from Knack Nako saying
look I'm going up against the guy who's
been a bit of an inspiration for me and
I want to send him home in a body bag.
Even something like the Gwen, right?
Because further to your point with the
AD jungler, we get AP solo lane pairings
most of the time. I guess they said Jace
is too strong to leave open. We cannot
give it over the side of Broken Blade.
It's banned pretty much all the time in
the LEC. I guess with the Ezreal as
well, it would have given nice range as
G2 obviously opting into the mid jungle
pairing and now setting up Hans Sama for
his historical best champion. I don't
know if you want to elaborate on that,
Dagger, but that feels like one of his
best. I mean, no, I agree. I think he's
had I think Han Sab to be honest, has
been kind of the most consistent
performer for G2 and I think he's
actually playing fantastic all split
long and the the Ezreal has been a very
strong pick from which in the past it
hasn't been as much, but he has really
come into his own and had standout
performances on this pick. So I'd be a
little nervous if I'm G2. Vitality on
the opposite side though getting comfort
for Niski. Niski has kind of fallen back
towards things like the Alistister, the
Rakan, the Re. So definitely Alistister
is most played and something that he'll
look to try and be comfortable on in
that bottom side against Hans Sam and
Lebron. Happy
birthday Rodrigo. Happy birthday. Happy
birthday. The crowd. Yeah. You know
what? Screw draft. Can we pause draft?
Do we have a cake?
Someone get the candles.
Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Young
old age of 30 today. I don't know
really. I'm just guessing. Happy
birthday. I don't know. Sending them
down the 30y old river. Maybe you I'm
sorry. I just figured I'm like, you
know, a lot of the time like coaches,
people behind the scenes of the teams,
usually they're older than 30 daggers.
So, I thought I'd play it safe. You
know, maybe not. Anyway, happy birthday.
Uh set up of bands. Look, we get rid of
some basic ones. Victor to take it off
the table. Poppy as well. Yeah, I think
Azir is probably going to be next to
follow. It's anything that essentially
gives range in that mid lane matchup is
what you want to remove as Leia and
you've already got that set up with the
buy as well. So, it's a very strong mid
jungle pairing and try and deny some of
that long range and safety in the mid
lane as an answer. I still am curious
though exactly what's happening with the
this Jace cuz I think they are going to
hold it till five to kind of solidify
where this pick is going to go. You
could always send it towards Chaiak in
the mid lane. And traditionally what
we've seen is h when you get the V
combo, you tend to want to use something
like the Rumble alongside it. And you
could always then shift that Jason into
the mid lane. Send a Gwen. Oh, actually
there we go. I was going to say send
that Gwen into the top lane. They're
thinking the same thing where Gwen got
nerfed in AD matchups, not so much in
the AP matchup. So she can work into
picks like the Rumble, but uh G2 good
read on that situation. Still such a
hell of a midame spike. And now that
that's off the table, we get to answer
that answer that question one step at a
time. They leave the flex up. They lock
in the Z and Z against Vi was always
such a good response because you have
the button to stop the VI button,
therefore nullifying everything.
Vitality, their options are good. But
how does G2 opt to run into this? Broken
Blaze picks are always fun to watch.
What has he got for the Jtop or
potential JTOP? As we said, nullify.
Yeah, and that's going to be the call.
just take the scion nullify the match up
and just say look I will be so much more
useful as long as I can deny Jace from
really snowballing in this matchup.
Leona going to be the parent side as
well which I do like less for the lane
unfortunately Alistar kind of answers a
lot of Leona and the rails that you
would want to go for in this competition
G2 but just really good follow up for
that buy engage to provide that long
range CC to complement it. So overall G2
very much a strong frontto back team
fighting style with dive options in the
buy in the Leona and whereas when you
look across the Vitality okay always a
treat isn't it we got from broken blade
but on the other side there's a Vladimir
now Dagda we still have to wait to see
which lane it goes in but most likely
top right like Vladimir mid has been
less common than the Jace mid. Yeah, I
think it will be the top Vladimir. And I
like the the transition, right? We just
said Scion, we've looked at like LPL and
LCK. They will just take this eye and
go, cool, I'm going to just scale. You
will probably get some turret plates.
You probably come out with a gold lead.
I'm just going to be more useful in team
fights. But with the Vladimir now, you
match that kind of passive scaling in
the Scion. You can also take some plates
and suddenly this Vladimir becomes a
monster in the later portions of the
game. Still though, I like I think
you've got good at least push for
Vitality in both top and boss or sorry,
top and mid, I should say, that you can
look to try and play off of Lindses.
But, uh, the team fights going to be a
bit more interesting cuz while you do
have a lot of damage, you do have to try
and get past this beefy front line as
Vitality to really hit the back line
properly. You're very
right. I mean, that Scion, the Leona,
great initiating tanks as well. So for
G2, how simple is the comp where you
just say we run into mid and they just
know, sorry, was getting distracted by
the right side. And how easy is it to
accelerate from there? Ladies and
gentlemen, it's a new rift. It's a new
day. It's new expectations that need to
be met cuz G2 on the edge alongside
Vitality is not where you expected them
to be. Gibb the other day, even
yesterday, said he doesn't think they're
going to make playoffs. G2 their
schedule. It might not be easy, but god
damn that's a big call when G2 are
really the face of League of Legends in
Europe. I mean, they haven't finished
outside of the top four since joining
the league. Yep. And now there is a risk
of them not making playoffs. Now, it's
still there, but a win here would be
massive for G2, guaranteeing them a
tiebreaker situation. Same goes for
Vitality in the uh if mishaps occur, but
we'll have to see if G2 can find that
success. said it hasn't been the most
successful time for them as it leaves.
Has not indeed. A lot of people going to
be asking the question of like what
really happened to G2? And I think you
can come back and you can say it really
felt like it happened over Madrid,
right? Uh only something to take away
from one weekend, but like oh my god,
they're GD at 8, they're 14, you know,
their stats aren't that bad, but it all
crumbled in that mid game, which is what
G2 spent all year last year working on.
And I think a lot of it was kind of
focusing around caps in the mid lane.
Whereas, hey, can we push him behind,
which we saw in a couple of games, but
even when he was able to get those leads
on the Oriana, he wasn't able to quite
find the success, the um the cohesion on
G2 wasn't really there for them. So, I
think that's where in a composition like
this, it fills me with a little bit
more, how will I say, confidence that
they can try and play through that just
because it's very easy to execute. You
have point and click from SKond, follow
up from Caps, follow up from LeBron,
Broken Blade being a nuisance as a front
line. It's very easy to execute on this
composition and we'll have to see if
they're going to be able to to find
their way through it because Vitality
have a composition that if it starts to
get ahead, really will just take over in
a lot of these situations. Vitality, I
mean, look, they're not the cleanest
team, but if you give them an inch, they
at least claw their hands across the
road to get to that end of the mile,
right? It has been so much fun watching
this team adapt this split and Vitality
fans are rejoicing because of how
explosive they've been especially around
the Herald fights. Niski walking up to
take a trade. He's going to pulverize
down. He's ignited as well trying to run
for his life. He ends up having to
flash. Double summoners down for Niski.
Leov with an ignite off the table. Yeah.
So nicely done by G2 again kind of
punishing Niski in this bottom side. It
has kind of been the the detriment of
Vitality. Although Kari hits the level
two, get a good straight back onto Han
Sama. Niski definitely struggling in
their last series and now again having
to burn that flash early. So we'll have
to see if he can have a little bit of a
nicer time. You know why I'm laughing,
don't you? Because again Niski in that
Nico game where he just, you know, he
got caught out so much in the early
game, ined quite a lot, caught out in
mid game and then finds one big ulti and
wins them the game. But that kind of
happens with Niski a lot where it's like
not only the Nico game, but if you look
at like their dragon setup in those, he
had some great like hex flash allar
engages to find those setups like and
again like Chaiak in that first game
with the Tia and that Alistar really
working well together. So we'll have to
see what they will be capable of doing.
But um yeah, I think the the only like
if G fatality start to get ahead here, I
should say that it's kind of difficult
for G2 cuz you're not a very high damage
composition. Like sure does a lot of
damage, but like caps kind of does and
if you're like Knacko and you start to
get a lead, it's going to be very
difficult to shut this Vladimir down. So
I am curious how G2 want to try and
interact with the map cuz at the moment
Qanon's moving botside but I imagine you
want to try and put some pressure onto
Knaknako so he doesn't just as you can
see here get a little bit of time to
just freely stack up and have a great
old time against this side ward's going
to be seen good sideep from Chayak as
also raised his head in capture
teleported to a ward but you know you're
mentioning top the greatest thing is I
think you're also talking about it in
draft like he needs attention cuz knock
into the scion a free scaling lane B
won't be the same deal. Pulverize sends
Leov sky high. Gets a bit of healing and
rather W's up. The pots are burnt.
Hansama pokes them out and the threat of
a dive is there. The Skuman also walked
over a ward spotted near Tri. Yeah, I
think it's just trying to allow G2 to
push in safely cuz at the moment like in
the support matchup, you have a ton of
pressure here as Lebron because you've
got that W. You get a ton of
resistances. You don't really match it
as Niski even with the aftershock. So,
you're always playing on the back foot.
The only time you can't really engage is
if you are too close to Nisk's tower and
he can find some way to punch it back
underneath the turret. But as long as
you avoid that like G2 should be fine to
just keep pushing in these waves. Notice
Caps just gets a good chunk out on
Chaiak, but he does have teleport.
That's the advantage. Caps comes back to
lane with a tier. So, and naturally,
he's going to have the uh access to a
greater health bar. Teleport going to be
a burn from Chai. He's coming back in
now with a pickaxe as well. So, a bit of
burst being added into this mid laner.
you kind of expect. Yeah, I know. Like I
mean this is kind of where Caps has to
continuously burn mana to push in
whereas Chai has a little bit of an
easier job with this pickaxe now just
auto attacking down the wave. So he'll
be fine as this goes on as broken back.
This is going to be the longest wet
noodle fight you've ever seen. I know
will take some damage. He'll get it all
back. If broken blade wants a CS, he can
play with that transfusion part two. Get
an enhanced heal and Knucknaka will be
completely fine. Fishy codeex with this
Vladimir. And look, oh my god, nice
damage. But it doesn't matter cuz he's
going to pop this third Q
to be fair though, broken blade has been
able to consistently push in this wave
and get some the demolish procs down. So
he got in that top side. I don't think
he actually got a play for himself, but
you'll see just as you peek at the top
turret that there is a bit of that
health bar on. Thank you, observers. But
also, it's kind of been seen in the
bottom side. So as broken blade is able
to get to these waves with the soul
furnace, that W shield. He's just able
to ignore the damage and Naknako won't
really have access to enough damage to
break that shield until he hits level 9.
So BB just making the most of the match
up as he can. Level six now hit as well
for both of them too. The teleports were
burn. So if there's any action that
comes from Grubs in 2 minutes with the
new spawn, it'll have to be them
traversing up top with their legs, but
dragons still up. Lind is hovering
around. Skim on the same. Mid lane seems
to be the focus here. both just wasting
time and seeing if there's going to be
any action. But for now, they just hold
off. No camps up and available either.
So, nothing better to do with their time
as Schuman goes to start the dragon
while Broken Blade is just ultied top.
Yeah, I mean, just rotating quick around
the map. Not a bad shout. You get Han
Sam and LeBron back to that bottom side.
Broken Blade will be completely fine
here. You can see he's stunned for days.
Can't really get through the health bar
and he just picks up the wave, right?
Um, and there's I like when you have a
sil like this being able to rotate
around the map so effectively with the
the ultimate cuz a lot of people kind of
expect it to be used as an engage tool,
but in the early stages you might as
well pop it to just get to a lane faster
cuz there's no one he can really do
anything. Even if he does still get a CS
I mean he just picked up double ruby
crystals probably helped with it. Lens
says let's dive this and broken blade
with only a flash up. He's going to try
decimating Smash. Lenses looking for the
W enhance and has the damage. Broken
blade flashes away. still being tanked
up now by Lensus. He'll have to get out
though and does so successfully. Wave
going to be received by dead broken
blade, but it's a first blood over to
Vitality in the end. Uh yeah, Niski died
by the way on that D. He didn't have
level six, so it's where you're way more
vulnerable as Nikki in that. Also, I
think the fact he just CCed meant he
didn't have the aftershock, so way less
tanky than you'd expected. Skimon trying
to make the similar play on the bottom
side of the map, but you always have
cool knacknack, which makes this play
way more difficult to go for. doesn't
have the ulti though, but you're not
going to risk it in the end. Tied the
blood to clear the wave and getting a
kill in that situation is broken blade
be chilling. One for one in the end and
especially since you get the wave off
the turret. Gold's pretty even. As a
sign, you expect to die a couple of
times, don't you? Just part of it all,
you know, experience. Yeah, you see as
you go in. So, I'm pretty sure Ni
doesn't have Aftershock cuz he just used
this in the trade before. And I want to
just double check as he goes in, but
yeah, it doesn't have it. So, he's just
not tanky at all. And you can see how
quickly that tower damage ramps up. So
Broken Blade able to pick one off. Lince
takes a beating on the way out as well.
And as you said, being able to pick up a
ton of that CS underneath the tower
means he's just in a good spot. Well,
game off to a flying start. Grabs are up
now. It's 8 minutes. There's only one
pair of them. One trio of them, I should
say, and G2 on them. They already got
first dragon as well. One taken, two
only needed for the feats, three for the
mites. So Vitality are able to pick up
one. They're going to be denied at least
the feats of warfare or feats of grubs.
whatever feet they fall into. Grubs
don't even have feet. Like, how can
grubs be part of the feet that they
don't have feet? They have little stumpy
ones, like little toothpicks. The mites
don't have feet, though. The mites are
just blocked. The mites are trying their
best. Okay. Yeah. Sorry for bagging out
the mites.
Um, daged. I talk about feet all the
time. I don't mean to, but League of
Legends since it came in today. Since it
came in, since it came in, they want us
to talk about it. Well, nothing's up for
now. I mean, you get one part of the
objective, that's about it. But G2, I
think they're definitely feeling good.
They get all three grubs. They deny it
from someone like a Chase, you know,
feels pretty nice with what he can do
with side lanes. And I'd say right now
the early game for G2 is chilling when
you talk about the front line when you
talk about the fact that like they will
need to get a move on with some of the
damage profiles in this comp. Yeah, I
think um as long as you're not losing
out on like a ton of turret plates and
stuff, you're in a relatively fine spot.
And at the moment, Skimon has been doing
doing a good job of tracking where Lince
is and just trying to match his
positions on the map. Lynn is now having
access to level six, though makes that
10 times harder because now you can just
ult to a lane at any point in time. So,
you can see they're kind of being a bit
more cautious about how far they push up
in the waves. And a Vitality are trying
to opt into this 131. So then they can
have both side lanes to try and play
around with Lenses. Sluses al check
still there, not used yet. Kind of like
the um the Nocturn feeling, right? Oh,
yeah. when you wait for that Pantheon,
you're like, you need your first two
gwans to be very inviting to the game of
League of Legends. Uh, by the way, we're
not doing much at the moment. Let's have
a quick chat. I think this team is
popping off at the moment. A lot of
people will agree with how they've
played games, with how rigorous they've
been in a lot of these fights. This
series means so much cuz again guys it
guarantees a tiebreaker for that sixth
place which is so huge when four teams
get knocked out of playoffs and they're
away until after MSI. If you sit on the
bench for that long like you get rusted
you know you don't want to you don't
want to do that and your chance of
getting to MSI as well off the table. I
think it's also cuz a lot of people are
kind of waiting for things to click for
this team like Niski obviously coming in
but also you know they weren't exactly
having the best of times losing 20 to to
Rogue and that but then beating Moby
Star Ko in 20 faction being able to beat
BDS last week as well and in games that
were tough for them to come into like I
think it's it's finally feels like
Vitality are starting to crest that but
we'll have to see if they can they have
to in this fight at least soul play
comes through Lindes is blown apart
doesn't even get to play the team fight.
Ni with the unbreakable will the ulti
negated by Kazzy. A great version of him
popping into the feathers but a
decimating smash sets up to put him sky
high. Caps doesn't get anything with the
ulti himself or rather the shove.
Niski's just flashed away. Everything
from Vitality lost. Broken blade looks
caught out here but he won't die.
Vitality caught again from the sides.
Yeah, Vitality is still pushing in the
side. So like it is a nice pick here by
G2 using the fact that you've got more
members there. also burn the TP from uh
Broken Blade. But the fact you only get
one, I don't know how valuable it is. If
it was like you get the pick and now you
get the dragon, fantastic. But dragon
still about 20 seconds off, so you're
not going to be able to pick that up.
And you do burn some crucial summoner
spells, but Naknako got to get some
control over the top side. Push in.
Didn't quite get the places. Emo Blade
comes through. Broken Blade, the hollow
radiance is doing work. And now Caps is
going to do the same too. He's traversed
up to the top lane to be a nuisance. And
Knucknako psychic shove just out of
time. into the Sanguan pool. He gets
away. This is what G2 have to do though.
Make this counter punch in the opposite
side cuz dragon is going down for
Vitality. Big and again I mean that
dragon shove flash knock alive but for
how much longer? The Avengers are
[Music]
here. There's four of them and Hawkeyee
is not really even a superhero like G2.
Smack him down. They're going to get
plating as you said for the dragon. Now
it's starting to be more worth. Yeah,
they needed to start making these plays
and it's a good call from G2. They knew
they couldn't really contest on towards
dragon with the uh the teleport
advantage that Vitality had. Although
not on Macako, I will say, but still
nice plays from G2. Tower won't quite go
down, but they're still getting a lot of
gold on towards Caps. That's big. I
mean, Caps's game so far. Set up
performance. You're right. Maybe go
again, but Chai has got Kiski to cover,
but the turret is almost dead. They're
going to have to abandon ship. Vitality
to let it go. First turret at 12 minutes
50 seconds very early into the game. G2
with the feats of warfare or I mean the
feats all route picked up from it too.
And it's nice plays from G2 using the
fact Han Sama was able to control that
midwave open up LeB to move topside and
constantly go for these plays and
forcing Naknako just not respecting that
G2 could go for the blade thinking he'd
be safer as the Vladimir underneath the
tower and now broke the blade. Honestly,
he's just using this to zone Nako and
he's just going to walk up at Demolish
and take the blade. Like you can see
here it does some damage and then Broken
Blade is fine. Absolute tickle with a
Rift Maker. Knock Knak still trying to
scale. I mean, Broken Blade has 700 gold
lead as a tank. That feels nice. And
we've complimented G2 after that last
play.
Vitality again. It felt like after the
pick weren't punished that much until G2
just said, "Yo, commit, commit, commit."
We get top now with an almost 2k gold
lead. They've got Grubs or rather Herald
is saying second grubs in a minute 15.
So we look top yet again as Vitality
start reaching their first items
alongside G2. Just trying to see what
they can achieve here. But Vitality in a
good spot to just cover. They've even
moved Kari down. You are getting some
alone time as Giant as you can see in
your bottom left corner with the the top
side turret which they're going to be
relatively happy with. And as long as
that botside tower doesn't fall as well,
I think Vitality are in an okay spot
here. But where's Lindus' ulti? So far
haven't seen too much here. The Pantheon
first ulti. Has he come through? I guess
again, where's the opportunity to do so?
Tag has been slow early game. I'm not
about that, but I know it'll speed up. I
know Midame will speed up drastically,
right? Because we have a two and zero
buy. Skimon's in a fantastic position
and as per
usual, guy always have an individual
lead. The thing about Skum is like
resources all belong to him. He's so
good at farming. And I feel like there's
never really been a game where I'm like,
"Oh my god, Skum's mega behind in the
individual match up in jungle. That just
rarely happens." Yeah, I think it's like
I think this game has kind of been a
case of follow Lince around the map and
make sure he can't really do the thing
he wants. And G2 obviously setting up
off that dragon play to make that turn
on towards the top side turret and find
the kill onto Knacko. But
it is also difficult when you do
struggle into the Pantheon like because
you go one way only as Schuman. If you
run into Lyn in the early stages, they
can feel a little rough. So, kind of has
to play a bit um safer on the play. We
don't need to talk about safety cuz uh
heralds up. Skuman begins. Vitality are
quick witted. I think this will be in
for a laugh if they can get in. 7 1/2k,
but Lind is doing his camps instead has
just used his empowered Q. So, no, they
give up herald. That is the third
objective for G2 outside of the turret
even. And again the early game Vitality
are giving up a lot here. Well, I think
it's Nako not getting the push in top
side and definitely hurt and then Chai
hasn't really been able to set up to
push well against caps cuz G2 have
started to send constantly LRV to cover
caps on that side lane. So then you're
not able to get pushed there. So it's
kind of limited the tools that Vitality
really have to play around. Um cuz even
if you try and go for the dive on
towards Broken Blade, you just don't
kill him. Like we've seen the damage
that Naknako can do. Lince's is going to
maybe take a quarter of his health bar
as well and then Broken Blade will be
fine, right? So where you can make plays
is kind of a bit limited here as
Vitality. I think G2 have done a good
job of punishing that. Especially Broken
Blade like he's getting so much value
from this and just ignoring damage and
walking a turret. Yeah, I mean he's kind
of strangling each solo lane he goes up
against. Niski spotted on a ward too and
Broken Blade just walks it back. Lev
covering now too. You can see caps has
just teleported.
There is going to be some brawls down in
bot. It's 50 seconds of dragon though.
But it doesn't matter what you choose
here as Vitality you lose. You can see
Vitality are rushing back to mid lane
cuz they think that's probably where the
plays happen because there's a Rift
Herald in the pocket of Skumu. So you
either cover mid or you lose and lose
bot or you cover bot and lose mid. Like
there is no winning here as Miski eye up
sama but with flash arcane shift I don't
think you're going to get anywhere.
Might be able to defend top as well.
Broken blade with his ulti available.
Just a question of whether he wants it
with the third dragon in this game. I
don't know. You've all been chilling.
You've all been eating. But get the food
out of your mouth. We're about to fight
for third dragon surely. And at least
leave a dragon. Yeah, please. I can hear
it. Someone someone here today is like,
"Hang on. I'm sorry. No, I'm kidding.
It's all right. It's okay. You keep
eating. We'll focus on the dragon for
you. You can sit there. You can lull
about. You know, drink your beer or
whatever beverage is going for you at
the moment." Saw a couple people. I saw
someone in the crowd with an IKEA hat.
Maybe Kazzy needs to get one because he
needs protection. He has to ulti. He
cleanses as well. The IKEA bucket would
come in clutch there. If only Kazzy knew
cuz now Mid is just open for G2.
Good side step from Kazzy. He survives,
but this is this might be a double
turret. Herald will smash this wide
open. Yeah, but it is a bit of a
self-made problem by Kari there cuz he
ends up walking into range of Caps's uh
seismic shove. And now G2 walking in
range of Lindses but can't really get
in. Ni oh pops the ulti though as
Lindses goes in. Vitality are not all
here together. Ni will engage but he
will surely die. The unbreakable will
will break nothing against G2. Schuman
with a double. The N's going to go down
and G2 are yes one down but making a
mockery of Vitality in this game one.
Yeah, Vitality starting to feel the
pinch and the desperation starting to
come out of them as well. But at least
one back for Chayek. Broken Blade going
to take stun damage from Naknako. But I
don't really think anyone's going to
come up here to try and help out. I was
looking at where Chayek was going. He
got the roses on the way out. I mean, I
don't think he's stressing. I think he's
all right. But yeah, dragon will be
taken by G2, but I was keeping my eyes
on like as you can see on the mini map
like what Chaiak and what Ky were up to,
but they didn't actually try to move up
towards that top side. I thought that
would have been the attempt at a trade,
especially with Lince has the level six,
but Broken Blade without that extra help
just clears out the wave. you don't get
the tower and you could even see that
LRAV was starting to move topside to try
and cover the play. But here like you're
3v4. So this was always going to be a
bit of a Hail Mary. Yeah. And uh I'm
really surprised they went for it. Like
Niski put himself in an awkward position
where he was always going to get zoned
off in putting himself in there and then
Lince tries to cover thinking that Ni
was about to get shoved back in towards
G2 means that he just becomes the focus
and then Niski's next to follow. So a
bit of baffling plays by the Vitality
side. Remember again, this was our match
of the week because of how Vitality has
risen to the occasion in the LEC. Right
now, they're the one of the most hyped
teams because they're this underdog
story that has had low expectations that
after the Hillisang introduction, well,
I shouldn't say introduction as Kazzy.
We're going to pause on that one. Might
be caught out, shoved back. He doesn't
get to ulti and Niski is just going to
die where he stands. This Fi is not
hungry because he's overeing. Six and
zero. every kill but one over to him. It
is a skew on carry show. Kari getting
caught out for a second time
there. He's face checking. You have no
business being here. Where is the
vitality we were hyped for? Because G2
are putting them somewhere in their
place. Yeah, I don't know what you lads
are up to, but it's not looking pretty.
Just getting caught out over and over
trying to find something back on plays
that have already gone out of control.
And then Knak Knako in a similar
position. won't be able to 1v3. I mean,
this fight will blast him. Caps finally
gets a kill. Or rather, he got one
before. It's a second, but G25 and Zero
making this look like a stomp in game
one. It might only be 5k, but the
feeling that I get definitely tells a
stronger story. Well, the thing is is
like the the gold is on the key people
and like here, Kari, like you're pushed
up way too far. You have zero control
over the top side. There is no world.
You should be up here and can't even get
the ultimate off in time. And then Niski
goes down as a result as well. But you
see G2 walking into your botside jungle.
I don't know why Lindes thinks that it's
safe to go in here cuz it's most
certainly not. Like four members
immediately jump on. It's fine. There's
just Genji Prime like
call them Genji Prime. Yeah. Okay. But
yeah, so for G2, I mean, look, we can
hit on Vitality for the mistakes that
they're making, but G2 are playing this
exception. They're clean. Cap steps up
though. Dagger goes golden. maybe still
cleaning up as there's help from lenses
but caps flushes towards Skumon. Niski
can't get away from him instead gets
shoved backwards. Long range damage from
Han Summer who's not even nearby. He
starts walking up as Chike is getting
kited away. Flashes away. Caps will live
to stay on the day now thought about as
G2 have a numbers advantage and you can
see that Vitality want to poke out. They
want to prawn. They want to fight but
they're not going to get the chance.
Knock knuck goes into the pool but now
there's a wall in the way. He flashes
over, but the disengage is not enough.
Brought back in. G2 are going to
continue adding the spice. They tried so
hard to get caps, but it meant nothing.
They were left
empty-handed, whereas G2, they're
walking away with a massive bouquet of
flowers. Well, Madrid looked crap, but I
tell you what, back in Berlin, it's
their home, isn't it?
What a performance so far. Let's watch
again as Caps navigates this. Yeah, the
going golden buying so much time. The
flash away. Niski tries to go forward,
but the the the camaraderie is here.
Everyone on G2 is covering for caps even
here. Side step as you get that pop on
the surf shield as well is just perfect.
And Shiaak actually forced to flash
away. And once more like Knaknako trying
his damnest to do something, but we
talked about how beefy this front line
from G2 is going to be. And Knaknako
just can't get through it. Flick back as
well. perfectly executed and G2 picking
up more. And look, the jungle difference
has been huge. Lince feels like he's had
probably one of his, you know, worse off
games of the split, but like Skuman is
always there. He's such a nuisance. The
power of VI continues in this meta.
There's a target there without their
disengage. But I think we kind of said
it like for Lynn's it's very hard to
make something happen this game. Like
when you look at the early game, hey, we
have to try and play off of mid, but
you've got LeBron who's constantly
roaming midc because our bot lane is
already behind after Niski having to
burn flash. And then you've also got
Schuman covering as well. It just became
so difficult to make a play even if you
go boss and Sama is so difficult to lock
down. So like how do you make anything
happen? You're right. Again, there's so
much mobility, there's so much
disengage. I feel like for G2, you know,
this comp dagger, we talked a lot about
how their conditions need to rely on
maybe finding a lead, escalating quickly
because Vitality, there's a lot of
scaling on that comp. There's front
line, there's good disengage, maybe some
kind of front to back and pause quickly,
but Broken Blade will not. He wants the
Raptor. He'll stand there and contest,
but Lindes ends up getting it while
they're playing top side, but bot is
where the dragon is. I guess Vitality
know there is no way they're getting
anywhere near this. See, the problem is
there's four members of G2 that were on
the bottom side of the map, but Broken
Blade exists in the top side of the map,
who in and of himself is four members of
G2. So, the match just doesn't quite
work out for Vitality at this stage.
It's been a while since I've seen such a
good quality fridge. I mean, we don't
get to talk about it much, but like the
unit, but my my fridge right now, it's
leaking a bit. You know, there's there's
ice on the back for some reason of it. I
thought it was too cold. I turned it
down, but it's dripping water. I got to
clean it all the time. What a pain in
the ass. But this ain't that. This is
like that shiny stainless steel double
door ice cooling. This is the one you
touch and it just comes up at the
temperature and lets you know when you
need to shop. It's got a TV. You know,
people have TVs in their fridge. That
feels unnecessary. You can watch Twitch,
but then what's the point? Cuz if you
open the fridge, you can't see. So, you
got to look to the side. You're like,
but how do I get my milk and watch the
LC at the same time? Good questions to
ask. As Lov He tanks this engage, but
caps his wall again. Does well in a
choke. You say it's great, but look at
the knockup galore. I feel like I'm at
my sixth birthday party again. Bounce,
Vitality. Bounce. It's so much fun, but
they're crying. They just want to get
out of this wild wild engagement as Tri
getting ulti knocked around as well.
It's bullying, but there's no parents to
help them. The commands are running wild
at the birthday party, but G2, I mean,
this was just perfect. Like the fact
that you were just setting up for that
pick in the choke like Vitality were
never in a position to really contest
this like they're looking for a pick but
again broken blade is massive and they
even try to go in LeBron but honestly
Leona incredibly tanky at this stage.
She's not going to happen. Bus Lyn I
appreciate it. I respect it. The shield
but he's dead. I mean he has to flip the
game. It's a 10k gold disadvantage and
the vitality jungler. There's a will,
there's a way. They always say I mean
it's just desperation like try anything
you can hope for the best but
unfortunately this game is completely
slipped away from Vitality. a 12k gold
lead for G2. But yeah, I like G2 are
playing this fantastically. Like again
like broken blade understanding so well
this match up consistently getting
turret plates the movement that we've
seen from schem caps around the map to
facilitate so many of these plays and
again from as well like he has been on
roam duty this whole game setting up so
many of these plays and I think this is
what people expected from G2 and it's
kind of been a bit sad that we haven't
got to see it from G2 but today they
really do feel alive. It's nice to see.
I mean, look, a lot of people getting
excited cuz they're like, "Oh, we don't
know where G2's at." And that makes the
league more exciting. It's more
competitive. But they remind you that
you still have to step up to the plate.
Don't get lazy. Don't get complicit.
Complacent, whatever the word is, Dag.
You know, you just can't settle back. G2
and it's only game one, but it is an
exceptional game at that. Vitality on
their last legs at 26 minutes into the
game. It feels like we might be looking
towards a quick night if this continues
as Vitality won't be able to stop any of
the backs here either. Nothing up for a
while, but double inhibitor down and
12,000 gold lead for G2. Yeah, you're
just you don't come online quick enough
for Vitality. Knacknako level 14 versus
the level 16 of Broken Blade. The three
items versus the two like they just
haven't had a chance to set up for
fights where they are actually
separated. Skomb separated now. Yeah,
but
can you kill? I mean, he's got a he's
got a stair escape. So by the time he
eventually goes down, G2 will be there
with all the mobility that comes from
Caps. Always a moment's notice, he'll be
there. Han Summer jumps in. And look,
Kazi's caught out. That's one mystic
shot combination. The feathers are
great, but he's dead. Eight kills for
this V jungle. And one more down for
Vitality. Uh, yep, that's a way into the
base. That's the 80 car again. So
Vitality down a man and you still got
Chai pushed in the bot lane. So G2 going
to just destroy this turret.
G2's death may have been grossly
exaggerated.
Just a speech maybe. You know GB not
only didn't get a 100 bucks yesterday,
he's also now sweating a bit. I see you
GB. You're telling me that G2 won't make
playoffs. I don't know about that. This
game is giving me a lot of hope. Broken
blade just runs into two turrets and
look at the engage. Who's going to die
from G2? If anyone think you know the
answer already. enough. Knuckle can't
even transfuse his own blood into a
saving grace. G2, that was utter
domination. That was incredibly clean
from
G2. Cool, calm, and collected. Doesn't
even begin to describe this cuz
everything just went their way. Insane
game from G2. Like that's one of those
games Vitality like, okay, whatever.
Probably like minute 15, minute 20 G
Prime, you know? So yeah, what do you
do? Oh, that's right. Nisky said it best
as I can see standing by some fans
obviously hyped about G2's resurgence.
How good did that look? Amazing. I think
uh so uh are the the reports of G2 being
bad or everybody flaming them? What do
you say to those people? I think they're
just haters. They don't really know G2
cuz honestly I'm used to them like ining
a bit
and uh giving us some content games. But
honestly, I was never in doubt. I
believe in my team and I believe that we
will come back stronger and stronger
every time. Yes, that's how they
gaslight you. They always do. But they
did have a fantastic game though. Um but
I have to say I love the chance that you
have been bringing but the rest of the
block isn't really singing with you.
what's going on?
Um, I don't know. I think it's just a
bit of uncoordination from our side.
It's like we don't really have time to
prepare everyone. There's a We have a
lot of fans across the world and it's
like a lot of different people come each
week and sometimes it's just people that
want to maybe relax. They don't want to
chant. They just want to watch the games
and you can't force people to chant if
they just want to watch peacefully. Oh,
you're right. I was going to say that's
fine. Never mind. Um, anyways, G2, it's
been tough. You've been a G2 fan for a
very long time. you've given hair, I
don't know, maybe other things perhaps.
Uh, but how have you been living this
period where they're not the top dogs,
you know? How do how does that work for
you as as a longtime fan? I mean, I
always support my team. Like, I sweat
for G2. I cry for G2. I lose
hair. So, yeah, I trust them fully. So,
we win those. I love it. It didn't seem
like Vitality was really there, right,
the first game. Yeah, it feels like a
custom game for us.
Okay, let's see if that continues into
the second game. Thanks for the spice
from the G2 fans. We'll be right back
with game two.

think this counts. Come on. Let's go.

pick. And what a ride. It's been a
moment of hesitation, but we're getting
closer to the game changer. And what a
legendary journey we've been on. I mean,
there's so many excellent options, but
one of them has to be a perfect to. Oh,
what a pick. What a way to close things

Flash. Yes.
Flash. Nice. Nice. Nice.
Nice. Keep it up. Okay.
Welcome back to the LEC. you. G2 finds
themselves in the lead in match of the
week after what their fans called a
custom game. It really felt like it. It
also felt like it's one of those games
where, you know, G2 just picks a lot of
random things and they don't really play
and then they end up, you know, kind of
practicing on how to win because this
wasn't really the typical G2 that we
everyone, you know, comes here to watch
and love. You know, this wasn't really
the explosive G2 where they pick the
funky counter picks and they go for this
and that. It was more this it felt like
I was watching Splice back in the day
when I was playing there where it's
just, you know, typical front to back.
You have two carries, three tanks. You
just I know people just sit in front of
me. Everyone is sitting and it's just a
walk in the park. No, I mean when I
think about players like BB, I don't
necessarily think about him like picking
just the straight solid tank that will
just blind pick and go about their day.
It worked really, really well here. But
where the strange stuff came through was
more in the macro. One thing that we
noticed very early on is just infinite
amounts of swaps early on. We saw top
and bot lane just keep rotating around
the map and that really changed the way
that they played the game. Um it really
felt like they open up the map. The solo
lanes then got really far ahead and they
used that to just run mid and make plays
like this. Exactly. Because now we've
seen these clips. This is just textbook,
you know, walk into the jungle when you
have these many tanks at this much this
amount of CC and you get ahead. It's
impossible for the enemy to retay
because you have all the tools you
really need, you know. Yeah, Vitality is
still walking in and ining a little bit,
right? But you still have now you have
all of the tools that that you need. And
this this team fight is just beautiful.
The way Caps just pivots around and
everyone just peeling for caps. It
started off really bad. But his
maneuvering around this difficult
situation was was insane. But again,
credit more to G2 because now they
drafted a sort of team comp where they
have a lot of tools to make these sorts
of plays because when we were
criticizing G2 in the previous week, it
was more before because oh, they're
making the game a little bit too
difficult for themselves. They have not
enough tools to punish these sorts of
things. But now lessons have been
learned, I guess, from what BB said
before. Yeah, it's like that walk that
they had to do to catch a train, to
catch a flight, to get back to Berlin on
time to be able to pract them some good.
Maybe it was like a group therapy thing.
But I also want to highlight Vitality
because Vitality, as you know, we
mentioned coming into this. This is the
match of the week because they have been
stepping up. They have been playing
better. They haven't been doing that
many mistakes. So for them to be getting
caught, for them to be walking into the
jungle without any vision brings the
question as well like what is going on
with Vitality? Is it the pressure?
Because when we do look at this again,
both of these teams have to win the
series to at least get a tiebreaker to
make it to playoffs. Vitality or Volvile
team, like we're not we're not
disagreeing about the fact that we're
going to be clear about that. They're a
volatile team. I do think in this game
though, they weren't expecting the solo
laners of G2 to get a ton of value as
early as they did with the bot lane and
top lane swaps keep going over the
place, opening them up for for blah blah
blah. Yeah, it's really important that
they do get a hang of this early macro.
We know the stakes the winner of this
gets guaranteed lifeline of a
tiebreaker. And they of course they both
want that. You don't really want to be
playing with risk on the line. And on
Vitality, if I'm looking at someone who
I would like to step up would be well
Niski, the MVP of last week and also
Naknako because I feel like Naknako has
been finding himself in this prime
position especially now with Vitality
also being on red side. He's the one who
has a lot of parity. Again, in the first
game, the the Vladimir didn't really
work. And even even though this usually
we always bring this crepo box when it
comes to, you know, glazing BB being
like, oh, he's the one playing the funky
champions. But now we find ourselves in
the position where it's reversed and
Knaknako is playing against this typical
meta slave in the top lane, which you
know, BB. Oh, hey. Okay. Okay. He we
glazed BB enough for like, you know,
being the hipster and playing the funny
champions, but now he's the meta slave
and now he is him, right? I think we're
going to see Niddly Top today after like
LTA last night. I hope not. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No way you're
saying LTA. Are you really ignoring my
boy Shy? Are you enjoy Are you running
over my boy? Recency bias. It's a
scientific thing. I'm just sad that this
is the shyasia. I I don't know what to
say about that. I mean, maybe look this
guy is going to be the carry archetype
on one side of the coin, right? Whereas
BB has played more towards kind of like
the front ling archetype regardless of
which form of front line it is.
Technically, a Gwen can be that with a
W. He wants to be stood in front of his
teammates. And having that kind of play
style like he did with his sign on last
game was really pivotal. Having red side
for Naknaka though, maybe it opens him
to have a better counter. I don't know.
Odo, it feels get value this game. He
can get value, but I still feel like
it's is not all in his hands.
Collectively as a team, Vitality really
needs to step up because now you're
looking at G2 and you're looking at Hans
having exceptional games. Cummon
controlling the game, linking up with
Labrao again, Caps being unleashed on
the map. So now it's a collective
effort. One man cannot take down the G2
army like that. We have a lizard cam.
Crocodilo cam. Sorry. Anyways, at least
brain ro. Let's go. We might we might
see red on top. I mean maybe that's a
hint. Look. Well, I mean BB's more than
happy to do. If we're looking, however,
at Vitality specifically, but in in the
grand scheme of the series and how
they've been playing, we're looking at
the bands and the picks that we've seen
from last game.
Which change are we expecting to see? Do
we are we looking at more individual
changes where we see different players
on different champions or are we
thinking their whole approach to the
game to the engage to poke would be
different? So I don't mind the approach
of give solo laners individual agency.
That's the approach that they had
before. I think that is very important
for someone like Nako. That's pretty
much everything that we've been saying
in the last couple. If you haven't got
that point just yet, I'm sorry. We'll
hit you over the head with it again.
Naknako wants that counter pick most
likely and he has the champion pool that
hopefully makes something work better
than that first game. And now with the
premier champions being out, when I'm
looking at at at jungle, I do feel like
it's still human uh playing around with
VI pantheon being out. I feel like he's
been the one who has been consistently
getting the sick. Yeah, he's getting
consistently more of the upper hand
between most of the junglers. You know,
being super high up in solo Q and having
just a deep champion pool. I'm curious
now what the first first pick would be
because there's not a lot of priority in
the jungle. I feel like it's going to be
even trades and a lot of and also what
I'm looking at is both team securing
support on 2 three because there's only
two engage supports out and I feel like
this is Nico do you think he did have a
great game you know I think the Varys is
a very easy first pick right I think
there are a couple of different options
you could go for towards top lane first
picks if you feel like you really want
to go towards someone like awan blah
blah blah varys I don't think there's
ever really a bad game for a vary and
Jin is the premier you
Blind pick assault, but it's also
probably the most reli reliable counter
pick into the bars because he provides a
lot of utility. The Nafiri, this is
really interesting because Nafiri did
get a heavy ban in the early game, but
at the same time, when it comes to
scaling in the mid into the late game,
she is just still this very annoying
dog. And I think um if you want to get
towards that late game, you like to have
one or two kills early. Two of the
earliest game junglers are out of the
table already in the V and the Pantheon.
So that does give potentially um the
nefar a little bit more window for
opportunity which is why you kind of
have to go for the shins. Now I feel
like I am really surprised that vitality
didn't pick out themselves because I do
feel like this champion has been flying
under the radar a little bit. A lot of
teams I see them prioritize this a lot a
lot more just because it provides you
pretty much you know everything. Yeah,
exactly. very good early mid game
transitions into late game you know
spacemaker/tank it just has a lot of
utility and the jacks something about
last draft specifically Odo that you
mentioned while we were watching was
that it was very vanilla very plain it
didn't really set up either team to go
crazy early mid or late yet G2 was able
to capitalize off of that are we
expecting G2 to just be sticking to that
cuz it worked I would say so because
this is when I look at all of these
champions that G2 is are are picking
right now with the bars with the Zenzhaw
with the Jax these are all huge comfort
picks for all of these players. BB, I
think one of his most successful
champions all time has been the Jax.
There's been years where he was 80 90%
win rate, you know, stomping the league
left and right. And even though it is
blind fake, the Atrox counter pick is I
would say it's a little bit more of a
50/50 match up. And I'm not sure if it's
the best counter pick I would be taking
if I was on Vitality side. Last time he
played the Atrox, really insane team
fight, even though he's behind. Also,
just weird coincidence, we have three
dark in this pick right now. There's
only like five of them. I'm like, wow.
Okay, that's just a favor with the
draft. But yeah, not knock out for me. I
think his top laning team fighting
impact on the Atrox has been enough to
justify this pick. Will need to make
sure he doesn't fall that far behind BB
though. BB when he gets ahead in the
match up really does leverage it well.
And now I'm curious how cuz now we're at
the pivotal point in this pick and ban
where Vitality and G2 have the option
with this last ban to take out the
engage supports because Re has already
been taken out. There is no left.
There's probably Rakana as well. And now
if either Vitality or G2 bans one, then
we might see one of these rare games
where we have range support. I'm looking
at the Poppy ban, so I'm assuming that
maybe if anything Vitality would like to
get their hands on the Rakan. Uh I would
think so. It's more of a you're at the
point where you make a trade and right
now given the fact that Braum has been
banned. You have Nautilus and Akan up.
Most likely we're going to see a trade
between the So no Nico today. No Nico
Fiski today. Jindico tends to be the
perfect he I mean you are memeing it but
he did find you know he missed a couple
of engages. He missed a couple of
engages but then he did find the good
one. Yeah he did kind of win the game up
until then he was losing it for them. I
was talking to someone for the Vitality
or who said don't worry won't be playing
that one today. We'll see if they've
kept their promise but yeah you're
looking for something um you can kind of
play a whole bunch of different things
with these two AD carries cuz the AD
carries carry you through the laning
phase when they're as strong as the
Virus the Jin. You're not locked into
anything particularly right now. And
while before I thought that Vitality
would choose redside for canopic top
lane, I think they can now hold on to it
for a canopic support if they really
want to make sure that mid lane I would
say with this sana or they're going to
offer the nautilus cuz it really feels
like maybe one of the issues was that
they didn't really utilize both their
counter picks well last game. I'm not
sure if the Jay was picked as a response
to but it was if I remember correctly
the flex pick. So, but now given the
fact that they have the opportunity to
get their choice of counter pick top and
counter pick counterpick mid, this is
probably them making the best use of red
side that they can so far because right
now it's just a trade between the
support. But the Renata pick I feel like
is incredible value because you have the
Varus, you have the range advantage, you
have the poke, you have Jackson's out to
make space and at the same time Vitality
very telegraphed. They want to go in,
they want to engage and Renata just
plays more into that disengagement.
Yeah, it's Renato into triple melee
already picked in from Vitality, which
is why I would have liked to see that
support counter pick because now you're
in a position where your laning phase is
hard versus Varys Renata. Your team
cuffs pretty hard as well. Vitality,
they picked the red side and we have to
ask who will make everything. This last
pick got to get a hell of a lot of value
because they chose red side. They chose
to get counterpicked in that support
role which counterpicks their team
compar
and uh while the Ari I'm a big fan of
it, I don't think it's the silver
bullet. Is it the value you need? That's
the thing. don't think it's the silver
bullet which solves the draft. I don't
really know if I don't think it's the
silver bullet, but at the same time it
does pivot into a brand new win
condition for by team vitality which is
side lane playmaking because I feel like
when you walk into these team fights
you're you cannot front to back. It's
obvious that you cannot from front to
back just because of the renata, but
right now with the Arox, with the AR,
with the Nafiri, the Jin utility, it
does feel like now you have a lot more
options. And the way you'll want to
approach fights at objectives is flank
all across the board. And I think they
have those options available to them
quite early into the game. You know, AI
Jin, Nless all get to make plays very
early into it. Vitality, they have
succeeded with hard to play compositions
before. I think this classifies as one
of them. If it goes late enough, you're
going to have to deal with the Renata
and and the problems that gives you in
lane and team fights. BB on Jax a bit of
a ticking time bomb as well. Vitality
need to hit hard, hit early and join
each other's plays well. Yeah, remember
that on the line here is at least a
chance of a tiebreaker to be able to
make it to them playoffs. So, Vitality
going up against G2 Esports looking to
push this to that final game. But can
they do it? Let's find out.
Lock in. Let's see. Vitality from the
past couple of weeks is game one
G2. Yeah, they were spicy. They were
hot. But uh Vitality, they were not.
Pska Gur big.
Yeah, we got we got so many signs in the
crowd today. But why is there a winky
face? Am I not meant to have fun? What
does it mean? It just means have fun.
Winky face. Winky face. It's like hi
winky face. What do you mean by that?
Hi. Are we talking more? We
If it says, "How are you with a winky
face?" I'm just completely lost.
All right, welcome back. Our match of
the week, game one, G2 delivered and
they stomped Vitality into the ground.
We are hoping that as you can see uh
finals in Madrid coming up for LEC
Summer. We are
hoping Vitality can deliver something of
that kind of caliber for this second
game. As nightmare said on the desk as
Dag will talking about this Vitality
comp needs to shine and shine quick in
this game. Yeah, I think if you don't
get ahead of Vitality, it's it's going
to be tough like you're Nefari really
needs to snowball this Ari kind of needs
to get in a position where it can be
threatening side lanes and I mean we saw
Jin earlier on to get to go 10 and zero
and lose the game tonight. So it is
always difficult to carry on a Jin. So I
think for G2 like taking it easy looking
to scale is all going to be fine. I
thought Han Sama would actually go for
the um the on hit build but actually
going for the poke build instead it
looks like. Uh so even then at least
having some answer for Ki when it comes
towards the range. Oh good blocking
though. Uh actually Han Sama's one who
stepped up. Niski gets a good trade, but
the return from G2 a lot better
actually. The power of Rata auto attack
someone like Khan Sama with halo blades
in this lane as well as they're going to
be the ones reach level two first.
Stretch line comes in again. Niski going
in here. The arrows are come out.
They're deadly. Lro's going to get
ignited down, but Kazzy also gets shot
back. So, Hans are in a great position.
Remember, Lro has pots and cookies.
Yeah, it's kind of hard to go toe-to-toe
in this early stages. The guardian on
the first trade from Lrov means that
it's a very even trade. Plus, you're
getting the shield and you're getting
that excess damage from the passive as
well on the Ranata. So, the trade goes
very well in favor of G2. On the
secondary trade, they go again with that
guardian down. But, it then becomes the
range for Han Sama where he's able to
just completely outpace KZY as well, who
is obviously on the Jin, much lower auto
attack and much more about utilizing
that for shot for that big burst of
damage. though and Sam just kind of
playing at range and bro happy to trade
his health bar cuz as you say he's got
pops he's got the biscuits he's happy
out and it's not the only lane that's
going well broken blade already just got
a demolish at 2 and 1/2 minutes I mean
that's huge as lince behind enemy lines
or rather his own for now just hoping
that G2 they're going to back here
but wait o like ships in the night
dredge line flash Hans he also barriered
there I guess that that's a that's a win
yeah a little nervous But just before
that, LeBro have actually landed a
handshake underneath the tower. So burnt
Kar's cleanse as well. So now I think
you got to be a little bit careful cuz
like a flash handshake into Skumand
arriving could be a little bit dangerous
on this bottom side. So I'll be keeping
my eyes on Skum. See if he does punish
the bottom side for Kari in this game.
Rock Blade's going to get the shove in
yet again in top in the meanwhile. Mid
also going pretty well for Caps as you
know. Oriana is the lane bully she's
good at doing. Wasn't an English
sentence, but you get the gist, don't
you? Yeah, she does the the winning of
the things. The winning of the lane.
Yeah, that she does that. Oriana just
lane bully. Good spacing from Caps as
well. It's little things like that where
Chayak not able to trade back as Linds
again, he's got a big job. I think this
game, I mean, he had a great uh Nefiri
last week, but boy oh boy, Lindus has
got his work cut out for him today with
all three lines.
Ni, he's gone for a roam, but it might
work out actually. The bailout is there
on Caps, but as he walks away, he
doesn't die. Doesn't need it. Skimon
gets the range and Wind becomes first
blood. And now Lindses' job just got
significantly more difficult as a good
turnaround by G2 on the play. Just not
quite enough damage to take down Caps.
The shield doing a huge amount of work
both from LeBro and Caps as well. Might
not be the only lane that's working
well. Knock Knucka could be in some
trouble, but Broken Blade just walks
back to the wave and look at where it
is. is uh in a bad spot for Knucknak. He
has to step up. Broken Blade's going to
zone him off the wave. And with another
one coming in as well on his side of the
map, Knucknak is going to have to TP and
hope that he can get a good trade off.
Yeah, he doesn't really know where
Skuman went to. So, just got to back
away and make sure that he's able to
heal up and make himself all all right.
And also just having that reset come
through is quite nice as the bra is
coming from Nia just the side of the
map. And handshake not going to connect
this time. Does he cleanse up in one
quarter of the time left? Yeah, I do
think it's um it's been tough for
Naknako because this is kind of the guy
that we were looking at saying, "Hey,
look, he we want him to be this big new
top laner, right?" And going up against
the the guy who has been the dominant
Turkish top laner for quite a while in
the LEC. I think Knacko had high stakes
from, but unfortunately the first game
didn't work out with the the funky
counter pick in the Vladimir. And now in
game number two as well, Broken Blade
getting that early reset into picking up
those early items and now forcing the
early TP from Knacknako. You can kind of
see that uh he's definitely the top
father making his top son understand
what's going on. I mean it had to be the
naming for this, didn't it? Because with
Knuck development in the league and
especially the stats to support it. You
look at the the damage a minute. Look at
the solo kills. He's got nine solo kills
in six weeks of play. Broken Blade only
a little bit behind him. It's so fitting
for the match up now. Game one, we
couldn't talk about it. It was a Sion
versus Vladimir match up. What the hell
are you going to talk about this one a
little bit more skill orientated as
sitting with a pickaxe for now versus
Fagee? Gold is even up top and Naknako
has already burned his TP. It looks like
he's going to take a quick reset while
the wave resets and top laners go bot,
bot laners go top. We do that thing that
we do usually at 5 and 1 half 6 minutes
that also sets up for the grubs spawning
at eight. Yeah, I mean this has kind of
been with the the change to Spirit
Blossom and Ionia, what to expect. Um I
I still think though with the way G2 are
positioned right now, the the early
skirmishing power they have is absurd. I
don't really think that Vitality because
they've lost out on these um early
trades really have a position to match
and especially not having flash. Maybe
able to be back up in time, but I don't
think it will be and for this like early
threat on top side. Nice shot. L is
here. Caps up against tret. It's one
bleed. It's the second and the dogs will
do the rest. Lince great gank timer. He
just don't miss. Man imagine to hit it
and now on the opposite side trying to
get some trade back, but Han Sama
getting that guardian able to trade
effectively in return. And both junglers
now starting to make their way up
towards his top side. Oh, great trade. Q
comes up for Han Sama. Andy almost died.
Really clean stuff from Hans. And Kazzy
now respecting that as well as Lindus
might be here, but in the way is
Skumont. He's got level six. Lindes does
now too. Ulti burned from both top
laners down
bot. Play going to walk it out. Knock
his rotation is back up again. I thought
Counterstrike might have been back up as
well. So Knaknako wasn't too sure. Lince
is about to run to Skuman, but both mid
laners moving. Skim might have to flash
just immediately. Chai was there first.
Doesn't pop his own ulti. Caps are going
to get altered on now though. Ch finds
his target but misses the charm. Ulti
away. Wind becomes lightning. Lindses to
disengage. Still has that stupid
invulnerable button. But Nitki going to
look for the dredge line. Misses. Linds
now thinking about the wave but still
that camp is not safe. Shas run out of
ulti as well. Caps zoning off. Well, mid
lane is fighted out. Look at Lince. Look
at Schuman. He's obviously winning here
on the Zenzou. Gets the camps as well.
Vitality have to back off and vis Blade.
Looks for the demolition. What's Knuck?
No, the burst, the flash, father, be
kept son, how could you do this to him?
He was supposed to be the one, but
really well played by Broken Blade and
Knacknako feeling the hurt on this
bottom side of the map again. G2 looking
good across the board. Caps saying I'm
will not be your Valentine to Chai in
the mid lane over and over again. Skuman
being able to push back lenses and a
great flash in response to Chayek once
more. really ambitious from Vitality.
It's starting to get heated. G2 with a
1k gold lead, but Vitality trying to
punch back while Lind does his first
dragon of the game. Note Grubs were
actually taken and Skuman's going to
finish them off right now. So, three
Grubs versus the dragon is the handshake
deal, but I once again see Schumond with
an early gold lead. And even more so,
Broken Blade with a lead. It's fueling
the top side of G2, especially when we
were saying that Vitality needed to be
the ones to get ahead. Now you've got
Broken Blade who is very much
controlling and dictating the pace of
this top side match up. Caps has been
doing a fantastic job of avoiding the
setup from Chayek and Lindes to try and
pick him off in most cases. And then
Skeumand as well been able to push Lince
back and steal away a lot of these
camps. And a huge amount of that is
thanks to this like ward that he's
managed to set up in the back. That pink
ward is spotted out consistently where
Lince is moving. Like how he rotated up
to try and protect Kari and Niski on a
potential topside dive means he steals
away the red. Then they steal away the
Raptors. It's this constant pressure
from G2 that Vitality just can't keep up
with. Cap's obviously really good at
playing with that as well. I mean, his
ability to step forward in this lane has
been huge. And look at the CS lead
between Caps and Chai. We came in today
talking up this mid laner on Vitality a
lot because Caps has been in a bit of a
slump. And it's not like a Caps normal
slump where you're like, "Oh, he's not
as good as normal Caps, but he's still
top three." It's like, no. Especially,
you know, Madrid weeks prior. Caps has
been rough around the edges. Broken
Blade. Could we say the same versus
Knucknako yet again? This guy stepping
up to Broken Blade. He was hit first.
Broken Blade forces him out. Knuckno has
TP, but close to getting solo kill
number two. Dad says no candy in the
evening cuz those sweet spots were not
hitting for whatsoever. And now you've
got multiple members from Vitality down
here to try and punish Broken Blade. The
demolish now looking for a way out. The
weld end is in. Side step up. Broken
blade. It's clean. He tries to get out,
but with the dredge line, it seems to be
an impossibility. The counter-strike not
getting a stun means Naknako has a sure
kill. Broken blade just wants to get to
the wave. He dives. He's wasting time,
but he's now out of mana. N going to
chase him up. You're right. But drench
line, where is it? He finds him. Ni's
going to slow him down. And the delay on
this back as well. Dag, does Knaknako
get the knock doesn't get anything. So,
it will be the TP burn from Broken Blade
in the hopes to escape. But honestly,
not having any kill or assist go over to
Knack Nako, not the end of the world in
the grand scheme of things. You're
right. I mean, a bit of extra gold in
this 1k lead of a matchup would have
been nice, let alone the kill. Knock
knocker not finding anything. And Broken
Blade, look, the the caveat is Vitality
going to be happy that this Jax has no
TP. So, Knucknako can finally get a
plate in the matchup and start clawing
back a little bit about how far he was
falling behind. Yeah, definitely needed
something to go his way. But, as you
say, it's still 650 gold. And now G2
looking to put pressure on towards
Shayak. But he is an Ari. He's already
pushed the wave. He's just going to walk
away. And I think going to be more of a
nuisance and try and interrupt the reset
here rather than actually look for
anything.
W is going to be Yeah. Well maintained.
Skan takes a turret shot for it. He's
going to stick around. He's going to do
it again. But he's got no camps up, so
he's kind of just fine to be a pain. All
he's doing is waiting for the crab
spawn, which is now just about to come
up. So he's just like, "Cool. I can just
fall back into river." And it draws
Vitality here to try and cover for what
is essentially a non-existent play. You
talked about it again. I'm seeing pings
coming. That ward is still there. It's
so high value. I mean, Niski will was
spotted, but I mean, that has been there
for about five or six minutes. Like,
it's a high value. Yeah. Yeah. And it
like it's just giving so much
information across and now you're just
going to back away. Skant gets the crab
and river that we were talking about.
His top side is about to spawn. So, he's
just getting good value out of what he's
doing on the map. still hovering. G2
want to make it more than value to pull
back. Niski doesn't get to go anywhere.
He's rooted up before he can flash over
the wall. G2 toy with Niski yet again.
Second death here. And Naknako gets him
trade back on Broken Blade. But G2 this
early game is going what you'd like as a
G2 fan as K's going to get handshake. He
cleans a bit early but lenses with the
all in. Inable is he sends out the
spears. Hanama though with a bail out
gets bailed out. The curtain call will
not find them all.
G2, this is their day again. It's a body
block from G2 that stops Vitality from
escaping and picking up the kill on the
far end of it. G2 just finding so much
value again playing off of Skumand in
the jungle. Sure, Caps wasn't even
needed. He's just been getting plates.
And this is the G2 that was missing for
the last few weeks. And now with their
playoffs potentially on the line,
they're coming alive in this game. the
bra. Look how quickly he waits to
handshake. Waits the handshake.
Immediately gets it back. So even with
the cleanse, Ki gets tossed in and Han
Sam Chak tries desperately to go in, but
the fact that he ends up just getting
clipped by the edge of the hostile
takeover means he can't get away. So Han
Sama gets the bailout and will live
another day. Such a rough game, Dagger.
I mean, again, we said that Vitality
need to be quick in this one. They need
to really power through early to mid
game and find themselves a lead.
It is a huge 3,000 gold lead for G2 and
Dragons up in 10 seconds. They're
already there. The setup's hard for
Vitality because of this deep vision
that we keep talking about. Vitality
needs some kind of miracle pick here
because trailing behind at this point in
the game. It does feel like we could be
set for a 25 or 30 minute win again if
they're not able to uh I guess kind of
relinquish some of the pressure. But the
problem is it's like how do you try and
move in to protect these as Lindses is
about to explain for it is uh you just
don't have tanky members on Vitality
like Nautilus is not a tank at this
stage. He is too far behind doesn't have
the resources he needs and caps actually
though might need death charge. This is
an opportunity. Vitality getting
something back. The spirit rush used and
Niski gets the kill. Oh my god. Chai
committed ulti. Look some mid lane
tendencies die hard you know. It's
taking a while to work out assistance.
Thank god my Nautilus has got all the
kills and now he can carry a broken
blade. He just walked it back. That's
some gold back at least. But I think
this is where it's it just is very
difficult for Vitality cuz sure, okay,
getting that kill will help Nishi get
towards that locket of the iron, but he
still won't be really tanky enough to
face tank into LeBron being able to hand
shake him skews damage, hand sama with
the chains of corruption as well. And
that kind of goes for everyone on
Vitality. You don't have someone who can
go in. Oh my. I mean, but just give him
the trophy. Jesus. Like that was smooth.
And it's nice. You know, when Knuckna
was doing that only the other week,
right? Some of his fancy footwork, some
of his side stepping, the individual
mechanics of some of the LEC players.
This split has really been rising to the
top. Now, with that, Broken Blade
receives a bit more attention from
Vitality. He's going to teleport.
However, G2 are not here. The only
person is Lebron and Han S. So I hold my
words. I guess it's enough. Broken Blade
teleporting down, making sure that
turret doesn't go down in response to
Caps getting top. But that was the
counterplay from Vitality. You can see
Schuman just have it. They're getting
Rift Herald. And now Vitality get
nothing. Even on the top side, Caps was
still pushing in very deep. So he's
completely fine. G2 players just dodging
everything. We check their
PCs. Bit of V going on in the past
couple of minutes. Vitality still
fishing for those hooks.
They're backing. They might lose mid off
this dagger.
Oh no, Kazzy. If it was Vak, maybe
Vitality would have a chance in this
game. Okay. Yeah, it is not looking
likely at the moment cuz I like the the
even the damage profile like Kari going
for the uh the static shift means he's
just not really going to be a big damage
threat. Mosquito. Same with Chak.
Yeah, but there is a lot of damage for
Rogalade. He's got Trinity forces Skuman
to back him up. Niski comes in. Flash
drag line. Broken blade flashes out of
the way. There's a TP coming in as well
behind enemy lines. G2 about to be
pinced. The new new flute comes up from
Skum. He's ready to dance. The Brav is
on the way though. Line begins. Step
charge up. Broken Blade's dead. There's
a reset, but Chia has to get on out with
the disengage. The curtain call after a
turret shot hits Lynis. The Brav there
to defend. Herald helping out as well.
Shelly just holding the minion wave
while mid for G2 might be taken. Yeah,
Skumod was hoping if he put down the
Herald, BB could get into the Heralds
and keep himself alive, but
unfortunately just couldn't get the
summon off quick enough. But you can
look at the map. Mid push, top push.
It's all coming out G2 with herald
charge as well. That turret's dead. The
first charge does more damage now. So
down it goes. G2 find bot turret. Look
at mid. Observers, if we may, please. I
want to see what's going on with Han
Sama. He got some really good damage
down. Caps, by the way, pretty much the
same with top turret.
G2 master class right now is an
understatement. A lot of people at home
be like, "Oh, you're glazing G2 again,
guys. Shut up." Like, they just look
good. They're good. You know, they're
playing really, really well. And that's
why this was a match as a win.
Especially like in a play like that
where you go, "Oh, but Vitality got the
kill." But it's like, well, yeah, they
got 300 gold or whatever it was, right?
But you lose bot tower. You lose a ton
of damage on mid tower. You lost a wave
in top side, if not a wave and a half
because Caps was pushing in. The gold
doesn't add up. the map presence doesn't
add up and you're just losing further
control over the game and that's where
it's like sure Vitality got something
but it's still G2 that in the long run
will gain value from a play like that. I
mean, I want to glaze Vitality. I'm so
hyped about this team. Even as underdogs
coming into the match up, I thought,
yeah, there's a big chance that Vitality
can win. G2 have really stepped up to
the plate. We've said it over and over
these last couple of games as they open
up mid and now looking for Knucknak
between the cracks, but they're just
going to get more control. Knucknako is
going to pace it back and no one nearby.
So, patience given and G2 are taking all
of this botside jungle as well.
But the pressure around broker blade
right now is massive. Yeah, I don't know
if G2 can actually get this terror
though. And it is Shia who's going to
get some pressure on the top side. But
if you can force this maybe. Okay, they
say
yeah world ender. There's Hans armor
using his alult as well. So that's death
charge in response. Good knock up, but
the hostile takeover flies and only gets
the minions and rage. Vitality look for
another angle. Is this their
opportunity? Is this their chance? How
do they find this? They have no TPS.
They can already follow up. Lindses has
to go invulnerable. He does, but the
engage going to follow up. Catch is
looking for a shock wave only a little
bit more with the range. Vitality back
off again. They're playing this ever so
scattered. G2 are walking separately,
but the gap closes still not enough.
That is two ultimates down on Han Sama
and Lro though, so G2 need to be a
little bit more careful. No World Ener
makes him way more vulnerable though.
I'm watching Han Sama. The poke doesn't
connect. This Virus with one and a half
items needs to start layering down.
Vitality with a chance to teleport onto
a ward. It's a flank. Vitality put their
nails in the line and start putting the
coffin. But who's is it? Where's the
name tag? Les at half HP. 6 and 12k.
Knock trying to get the flank though.
Can he make the play happen? Broken
blade in a world ender but set up by
Nikki. There's the charm as well. Follow
up about to die but here he goes. Bail
out. Almost coming through. Kazzy jumped
on broken blade takes him down but
Vitality has found a couple of picks.
It's a shut down. It's a charm. It's not
bad, but G2 remained on top of the
dragon. Skum is still pretty damn
strong. They get what they came for.
Vitality tried to jump every which
direction in this fight to keep
themselves in with a chance. You end up
getting that lock down on towards LRAV
hoping for the bailout. Valencis with
the invulnerability able to go over the
wall and Lev just barely doesn't go down
in time as you get the kill onto Niski.
Kari flashing away to try and keep
himself alive so they can get the kill
onto Bl. Lince and Chaiak in this fight
using this twoman duo to pick off Han
Sama, pick off the backline in G2.
That's what you want to see, but it was
G2 who are still up to get the dragon
and still get the kills they needed in
the fight. That's what they did last
week. That's what I remember against
BDS. It was Chaiak and Lens really
setting each other up. Lince again on
Nefion something that can carry even
though he's 1400 gold down. That's where
we look at the selling point for
Vitality here in this game. Now remember
is up. There's only one. Thornbound and
as the Bravo walks into Knucknako,
Vitality can't keep getting caught out.
Broken Blades also run in and Knucknako
at half HP. Zoned out. There's a shock
wave. There's a world ender. He can only
go in but stunned up regardless. Shock
wave bursts him down. Vitality again
caught out. Lenses will jump in and
bottom but a flush as well. G2 all five
survive Vitality. It's a counter play
but the counter punch doesn't look as
good as G2 once again. Caps's patience
on the shock wave was so good there.
Constantly moving the ball. So every
time Naknako tried to walk back towards
his turret, he would have to walk over
the orb. The potential for him to be
pulled back away from the turret for
safety. And it's when Niski actually
goes in, Cash pulls the trigger, kills
Nako, and it's the picks that are
lending in towards Adakan, and further
wins for G2. Spirit Blossom picked up,
or rather Spirit
Pedals. Vitality straying further and
further away from this game. But look, I
mean, this is Knacknako getting engaged
on by a walking Granada. Watch the
balls. The ball here. Knock could be
pulled back. Ball here. Can't go to
Terry, gets pulled back. Ball here gets
pulled back if he tries to go to tower.
It's the positioning from Caps and
zoning with this ball that constantly
keeps Knacknako from being able to get
towards his tower. And it's eventually
when they actually go for the allin as
Vitality as Niski goes in, he pulls a
shock wave. Run, run like the rest. We
are
at least the team motivation, the team
camaraderie is still high. I mean, it
has to be like
Vitality is such an important game. You
got to keep your spirits high because
although this series doesn't kick you
out of playoffs, this is a series you
look back on that and the Rogue One,
right? because that should have been,
you know, a win if Vitality playing like
this that you could be saying that's
what gets us into the top six when it is
such a, you know, big dog battle to make
it into playoffs for this split. Yeah,
as you say, like the fact that you can
guarantee yourself at least a tiebreaker
to get in is huge, but MSI again needs
to run away. Wind doesn't become
lightning this time. Skuond is deep.
Knuckno goes over the wall. There's the
re-engage, but where is the damage? He
ulties. Knuckno flashes out. Chaiak hits
a great angle, but Niski in the thick of
it for now. Schuman still not dead.
Knock doesn't have the damage nor the
reset. Caps is low. He's got a bail out.
Chaiak playing with it, but still not
dead. Caps the shielding. It's enough,
but really too much for Vitality. Every
single time I'm watching this team as
the hostile takeover takes root and Lis
runs into Schuman to boot. It's G2
walking foot and foot through Vitality
again and there's zero Vitality can do.
Chak needed a reset desperately, but the
damage isn't there.
There's just every fight it feels like
they're trying to threaten this
backline, trying to look for flanks, but
they just again there's not enough
resources to kill people off. Again, you
talked about the chin build. We didn't
see much anymore because that mosquito
build is doing nothing. But I want you
as you we get into this to watch how
this fight like where Chaiak is
positioned and how close he is to
actually getting this cuz Naknako gets a
lock onto Skuman but doesn't get the Q2
here to keep Skeumand in towards the
infernal chains. And then as you get
this gank from Roken Blade, watch Shyek
gets some damage on Caps. Can't get the
charm. Goes golden. Then goes in one
more time. Barely the charm missing
because Lro ends up tanking it. Then he
misses with the orb of obsession.
Doesn't kill G2. Then the shield comes
in from Caps. If he gets one, he starts
getting the resets. Finish off Lro.
Finish off the next and carried through.
But it's just barely short every time.
Props to Chai. I mean that was again so
close. As you said, all it takes is one
and maybe a terms of vitality with 7,000
gold is getting even worse and G2
flaring today. Caps is back and he's
broken the system again. Caps, what have
you done with the zus? Please press it
so we can fix our ears. Le though face
checking dual line doesn't connect.
Neither does the deadly flourish.
Vitality are trying to play the death
brush. But even that won't fool G2 at
this point. I think I need Oh, he's
fixed after that one. That was not
pretty. Vitality trying desperately to
make anything happen. But G2 group up
once more. A third dragon on the cards
and he just can't contest.
Continues.
I live this or whistle guy. No. No. The
whistle guy. Much worse. I do have a
whistle here. Might bring it out
tomorrow. Depends on the games. It's
just got to feel the vibe. You know when
we start getting crazy, we get to
50-minute games. Then the whistle. Oh
boy. Oh, that's what really rings for
us, doesn't it? Okay, soul point. Will
we get a soul in this game? G2 are
looking to make this an under 1hour
series, which in League of Legends these
days is very short. Like, yep, we
consistently have 35, 40, 45 minute
games because of all the new objectives,
because of just how long these games are
going without scaling elements.
But G2 are going to be the exception of
the rule, aren't they? Broken Blade
minus one. He knows. Okay, he's upset. I
would be too. But look, Broken Blade, he
deserves the world this game. He's
played pretty well in the isolated
matchup. He is the father after all.
He's got a lead by example, doesn't he?
Now, Dagna, probably chilling, by the
way. There's a radar graphic. You know,
these existed. Yeah, been putting these
together, I think. Yeah, Miku has been
doing a great job. But yeah, I think it
like it does say a lot in kind of on the
stats that we brought up earlier on like
the fact that you may not get the the
huge CSD per advantage for Naknako, but
he's getting a lot of these solo kills.
He's finding the kills that are giving
the gold leads in a lot of these
positions or even be able to get the
turn plates where I think that is the
success that Vitality found a lot of
situations kind of playing around
through Knack Nako. But BB is a
different beast. He is uh he's
definitely been showing why for a long
time he was considered the best top
laner. Now still debated as to whether
he's the best top laner but this man at
times just does not miss and Naknak
unfortunately has missed a couple of
crucial spells when he kind of needed
them to hit BB. Yeah been a quite a
series from Knaknako I think scaling in
game one beating out jungle attention a
bit as well for game two. Niski not
hitting dredge line. You could say the
same for him. Lenses invulnerability is
an inferior ability. Skuman just gets
tagged on the way out. But I mean Skuman
is taking no damage ever. He's fine.
He's got Sunder sky black cleaver
invulnerability like there's very little
that you can do to affect Skumand at
this stage and broken blade consistently
shoving in side waves and just continue
to take jungle farms. So then Lince
falls further and further behind and and
a fury that is two levels down compared
to Skumand is just not going to have a
good time. I think that's kind of the
story for a lot of these kind of crucial
matchups. Even when you look at broken
blade
about these are matchups that you needed
to win hard as Vitality and it just
hasn't happened.
And again, it is nice to see that
Vitality is still willing to play picks
like the Nefari,
but we knew this compat time runner. We
knew that Vitality nearly really need to
get ahead. I mean, props to Chik by the
way. Maji in hand with no stacks.
Maybe that's optimism saying this game's
going to change pretty quickly. I'm all
for it. Two and a half minutes of
dragon. Baron's up. Let's see that
optimism in action. The thing is, I
think in this position, it is actually
correct to go for this because you get
so much value off a kill. It's the only
way you can try and snowball this game
back into your favor. It's there like
you're going for a traditional item just
will not happen. So, I I like it in this
sort of spot. It's let's try and get as
much value per kill as possible. It's
not a Ro of Ages build. I mean, I'm
happy it's not a Rod of Ages build,
right? It's like not a one sizefits-all
item. So for Vitality, there is damage
available, but they just got to hit on
the right targets. Niski face checking
here into
caps. All takes is a shock wave. And
again, Vitality going to lose their
base. It's a massive gold deficit.
Vitality looking for a charm or
deception tickles doesn't even hit. But
but Vitality don't know where broken
blade is. He hasn't shown on the wave.
Now will show actually doesn't even
midwave. They don't care. Deadly flash
is there. We need damage. They need
damage. Vitality running into Schuman,
but he gets a smite down. Meanwhile,
Knak Knako wanted a flank and he got
one, but the whole of G2 are there
waiting. And now that's going to be
Baron, but that was what we were talking
about. It's impossible.
Okay, I don't think he gets Oh, minions
aren't there. It's a mosquito build for
a reason. Kazzy doing nothing at the
moment. Le getting the dogs unleashed on
him. The handshake out. Ni caught out.
Depth charges there, but there's no
follow up. Ni having a rough one. two
six and two G2 have his number every
time. The side stepping is egregious
from this team. But it's also again the
problem that we were talking about for
Vitality of who face checks. Yeah, like
Knack Nako stepped into a brush he
thought he owned and died immediately.
Niski hasn't been able to find them. Jak
is getting choked out by caps and the
Braum is probably just standing in front
of Lynes right now. He is. He walks into
them. He's been doing the same thing.
Charm doesn't connect and G2 are just
doing the dragon. Sorry, Baron by
themselves. Shock still there to zone.
And there you go. Baron 9 and a halfk
gold lead. This is so easy. If they had
dinner reservations, they can just go in
about 5 10 minutes time. But they got 30
seconds time until they're going to be
eating good cuz Infernal Soul going to
be up and available for them for dinner.
And Vitality. Yeah, they've gone Sichuan
style. They are getting spice and flame
and fire and everything good for
themselves. They they went to hot pot.
They asked for mild and the day got
spicy, you know, but you don't want to
look look like a wimp. So, you got to
sit there and eat it. But you're
sweating, tears, screaming face, the
bits getting dirty. I mean, god, if you
don't know hot pot, you think this is a
real different activity as Skimmon's
looking for the chase. Nisky got caught
out. He was pretty deep looking for an
angle around the dragon, but he will not
find instead. His death remains. Number
seven on that as Han Sama hits another
target. Caps meanwhile onto Kazzy.
Splashes away from Lenses. Run in run,
but his own curtain called again as
Lindses has now flashed away. He's a
quake. I'm the new target under turret
again. The shock wave held until
flashed. Caps is playing with this dog
and it's not even his pet. And Jax is
just working his way through the bot
side as well. He chased off Chia. He
knocks back Knac and now just may knock
down this turret as well. He's playing
with them too, isn't he? Vitality don't
know what hit them here in this series
so far. There's about eight nine kills
between them. Broken blade forces out
the fight from Jag and back into his
base. He goes double inhibitor at 31
minutes. A slower game this time as Nisk
is just handshake sent back. Slapped on
the cheeks said they're there. Sport has
broken blade. Death charge up, but Lro
is there. Gives him the shield jumps in.
Counter strikes cares not about his
mana. [ __ ] away from Knuckle, but the
piercing flight. The Baron minions. Hans
has your number again. And G2, it gets
better. It gets better and better and
better for Vitality. It gets worse and
worse and worse. Hostile take over for
the zone. And Chai is trying to find
that angle again. Caps is so tempting.
He's that last bit of pig's blood. You
just want to shove it. It looks so
juicy. But Chak running for his life cuz
Skuman now with the chase up. Flush
available. Look at the damage. Shak is
going to be into the dirt immediately.
And as Schuman waste time, G2 have shown
that the tragedy of their death was very
much
overstated.
G2 a confident series, a needed series
for both themselves and the fans. You
can hear in the stands as Lynis tries to
go for Adsama redemption going to keep
him topped up. gets close. But look, the
next turrets are falling down. Teleport
in. G2 want to end it here. And now you
thought G2 were done. You thought they
were dusted. You thought they were
watch. You thought Europe had different
kings again. Different sides. But no,
just when you doubt them, they always
find a way to come back in. Our match of
the week. Nah, this was a wash and G2
did it
cleanly. Vitality thought they stood a
chance.
Europe thought the G2 might be
crumbling.
But here they found their footing and
they look
scary. That's a G2. Europeans will
remember now. Who do you vote for? You
play of the series at
lex. Kia would appreciate some broken
blade skiond. All the brav love
there. Well hot damn. I'm offended that
caps is not in that list. I actually I
mean I think it's hard. I It is hard.
It's a hard cuz I think LeBron's roams
were fantastic game one. His handshakes
in game two were great. Hans Sama was
mega clean like sidestepped everything
and human on the Zenza was in the face
of Lindses every single step of the way.
It's it was a team across the board
stepping up which is why G2 looks so
terrified. You're right. I mean every
element firing again and Broken Blade he
was the top father once more.
Yeah, bring your son to work day and uh
show him what Nako just sat in the
corner, you know. He didn't get to play,
he didn't get to play with any of dad's,
you know, like fun stuff on the computer
or anything. He just sat there and
waited till it was home time. Yeah. And
then like when he tried to I just kind
of swatted his house away like no
can't touch that. That's my tower now.
That's my tower now. Okay. You get to
play with it later. Next week. Next
week. You just sit there and eat
something. Okay. I'll be with you in a
second. Uh, that was a stomp. And I'm
I'm sad because I feel like Vitality, we
really hyped this up for genuine reasons
that like Vitality have been looking
really good in the past couple of weeks.
They're starting to pull stuff together
with the, you know, individual elements,
but G2 destroyed them. And, you know, I
can see Skuman behind me with shocks.
There has to be some element of easy
clap going through that guy's mind.
I think so as well. Well, welcome
everyone to the Marriott Bonvoy postgame
check-in of our match of the week where
G2
glitches the victory against Vitality
Skuant. Uh, it's been a while. Do you
remember what it feels like to get a
win? Yeah, it feels really good. I mean,
to be fair, like we had really rough
weeks recently, but this one feels
really nice. I can imagine. I mean, it
was a long time coming. Now that you
kind of have the fresh memory of what
went wrong in Madrid and what worked
here, is there anything you can
definitively point to as like this is
what we needed to do better and we did?
Yeah, I mean definitely. I think like
we've had pretty good talks after our
defeat and I think that we figured out
like how like we've made so many
mistakes tempo wise and right now I
think we are making sure that we're
always playing together which we were
not when we were losing and I think that
it really showed today and I'm like
really really happy with how we played.
So that was nice. Looks like it's a
relief, a very big one, I can imagine,
in the race for playoffs. Um, when it
comes to kind of how you went through
the losing streak and a situation where,
you know, maybe players would blame
themselves. Did you ever have that
thought of, oh, the winter finals and
now these series like is this something
that I should have accountability for or
was it more with the team? Yeah, I mean
like after like we as we as G2 like we
always like think about like as a group,
right? So like we had a lot of talks and
obviously nobody's playing anyone
obviously like all of us individually
had some um regrets because like maybe
you could have like took the screams
like more serious like this kind of
sauce right but like in the end I think
like we all knew that we we were just
not ready for the finals and like for
now right now like we were on a three
series losing streak but I think that
we've actually we are always trying to
figure out what's going what's going on
in the team. It could be draft, it could
be game pirates, and I think that right
now we have a pretty good read and I I'm
really looking forward for the next week
and hopefully get some win on stage.
Amazing. Um, you had some very loud fans
cheering for you the whole time. They
want to know when Noo-Noo is coming out
on stage. Well, that's a really good
question. I've been teasing up a lot
since Fearless Spit started and yeah, I
mean like Wakana cooking and hopefully I
can pick it soon. It will be my dream
actually to play it in the in front of
the French crowd in Paris. Maybe next
week. Ah,
okay. A little tease for I now you are
Kia player of the series. Kimmon,
congratulations. Uh, let's take that
into next week. What a final week.
You're playing KC in the match of the
week. You're also playing SK and you
know how the last road trip goes. I
guess there's a lot there that you want
to show. No, in front of a crowd, we can
also do it. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Like I
think I don't think we are truckers on
stage. I just think Yeah. like we had
pretty bad week of scream. So I really
show want to show to everyone that we
are in our redemption arc and we will
make it through um this split and
hopefully we'll make it to MSI as well.
Any words for Casey?
To Casey? Yeah. I mean good luck to
them. They're really really strong team
and we're looking for revenge. So it's
going to be a banger.
Awesome. One final question. Um, there
have been a lot of people that love
saying that G2's going to fail. You
know, we had the Kyoto quote, they're
not going to make worlds. Goldberg also
has said on the broadcast yesterday that
he doesn't think that you will make
playoffs. Do you have any reaction to
all all those haters? I mean, yeah, I
mean, I think it's pretty natural for
everybody like to kind of hate on G2
because like G2 has been winning like
for so many years and yeah, like we lost
final in winter split. So, I think it's
like pretty normal for everyone to see
us lose. I think they will be happy if
they see us lose, but one thing is sure.
We will get back and we'll see. You will
see us make it to the final again.
Amazing. They can't get to you. I love
it. Yeah, he doesn't care. He's just
player of the series. Um, everybody,
they're doing PGL over in the fan zone.
So, you can head over there to PGL with
Jenny Nimira and Broken Blade, who maybe
will give us a bit more spider.
Welcome to PGL. We have uh BB himself
joining us on these high chairs. Uh
can't reach the floor. Anyways, you
know, let's I want to ask you the exact
same question. You know, GB was like,
"Oh, I don't think G2 is going to make
playoffs with this win. You've at least
locked a tiebreaker. You know, the bare
minimum." Anything you want to say about
that? Uh I think he's just a hater.
Fair. Uh that's about it. That's a
really hard-hitting analysis. Thank you.
I appreciate that. Thank you. All right,
let's uh let's talk about your road back
to Berlin. I mean, it's no secret that
Madrid wasn't necessarily what you were
probably looking for. It no win under
your belt there either, but then the
road back to Berlin also had its own
obstacles. Do you want to describe the
road trip that you went on maybe? Like
what what did it look like? What is
this? Um I was actually on a different
journey than than the team because I was
with my with my girlfriend. Um, but I I
heard a lot of stories.
Um, I heard a lot of crazy stories. I
mean, obviously, like I think it's
better at some point you ask some of the
the guys that were actually part of this
because it was crazy. It was a crazy
story. I think you could make a movie
out of it. Labro was apparently very
funny and Skumodont couldn't stop
laughing because he was like he's
saying, "Guys, let's like he was like
very scared and it was very funny to
listen to. It's a very good story. Maybe
we can even write a book about it." Um,
maybe you should write a book about it
because you're saying LRA was apparently
very You can write the book for everyone
else. Like you can be like their
biographer for them. I mean, it's a
different story. I How I survived the
nocturnal IRL. That could be your title.
True. Uh, it was definitely like the
later it went to the day, the more
scared I got because you don't know
what's going on, you know, like people
are sometimes just like in game.
Exactly. Sometimes uh just the last two
weeks of G2 haven't been Today is great.
Yeah, today is the first step forward to
to greatness is how I would like to
describe like if I had to describe the
chapter in my book right now, that would
be the title. Okay, I'm sure you guys
would read it. I I would read all of I'd
read everything. be a bestseller. Okay,
let's talk about this first step to
greatness then because it felt like
today G2 is more like going back to
basics, making sure that you guys are,
you know, holding on to that early game
from start to finish, not letting go any
of the leads, really making sure that
you're hitting everything home and
focusing on the fundamentals. Would you
say that's been your focus since Madrid
anyway? No, I think we I mean it's not
hard to say that we have been
struggling. Um I think it's very
apparent that yeah we were on like we
were hitting like a like a wall. Um but
I feel like like yesterday actually we
had a very very good conclusion on why
we are not the best right now and I
think this has given us a lot of clarity
and I feel like momentum as well to to
play as good as we did today because
frankly we didn't play this well in
scrims this week. Um, but I feel like
just the the talk we had made us play a
lot better today and I I'm sure of it
that it will lead us to play better in
every single game from this point on in
the split. So I'm very looking forward
for the next week where we actually have
productive scrims and take on uh Casey
and SK of course and in particular thing
which think we noticed quite a lot on
the desk from game one um new patches
through different objective timers feels
like that's changed the way that you
potentially swap around the map some of
the early matchups you swapped lanes top
and bot four times before 10 minutes.
This is probably something that we'll
see investigated more by teams. Is this
something that you've been working off
in the week? Is this something that
you're aware of kind of like changing
with other teams in Europe? I mean, I
think the swapping, ever since they they
did this first lane swap uh in in China,
lane swap detected. Um I think it's it's
very strong, you know, like it just gets
you out of the laning phase, especially
if one of the sides have like a bad
laning phase, you you just get out of
it, you know, like I'm playing S against
Vladimir and I don't want to land
against Vladimir. I'm better against
that duo and Vladimir is not. So, might
as well swap out of it, right? That's
just how the game developed over the
years and that is why it's strong. And I
also think the objective timers make it
a bit more awkward to swap because it's
a bit delayed on top side. That's 2
minutes delayed. But especially when
you're trying to figure that out in the
middle of a season as well when we
already had changes to grubs and the
Atakan earlier in this year too. I'd
imagine that throws a lot of chaos into
the into the equation. Yeah, I mean I do
think grubs
are different. So people are still
figuring out how to play with them in
the game. There's only one spawn of
them. Uh, and you get it very early. And
if you get it very early, you start
hitting the towers, you know, get some
money, some investment, get paid. So,
yeah, it feels good to be honest this
patch. The only thing I don't like, if
you if you're wondering. Yeah, go ahead.
Go crazy. I don't know if you The only
thing I don't like is the colors
actually. You don't like the colors? You
confuse me a little bit. But I, you
know, like anything in life, you have to
get used to it. Mhm. And right now
losing sometimes. No. And losing Juno
and me especially, we don't get used to
losing. Okay, let's bring up let's bring
up the standings because you guys did
lose a couple of games, right? So, three
series in total which puts you now at
4-3. So, you're shared third with MCO
Heretics and yourselves when it comes to
when you're looking at these standings.
I would really like to start off with
coming into spring. Did you expect it to
look this way? Uh, no. Thought so. Um, I
mean, I expected Fnatic and KOP to be
strong.
Um, and I'm I'm a bit like I think the
settings are very close actually. Like
not on on on top of the settings, but
like the middle of obviously there's
only six teams going to playoffs. So I
feel like it makes it much more
interesting to watch these games and
also like just cheer for your favorite
team because like for us we were we are
rarely in this position where we have to
even fight for playoffs as G2. So for us
it's a different challenge and we're
going to take it with you know
everything we got and make it through.
Who have you got your eyes on then in
terms of the other teams like for you
personally? Um in terms of personal
connections, you've obviously played
against a number of these players for
many years. A number of the players
you're playing against now are kind of
looking up to you as like the Turkish
top father as well, Nagnako and lot and
players like that. You've had a real
influence on them. Do you think that um
for instance, you know, Nagnako you
played against today? How do you feel
about Vitality going towards playoffs?
Um I mean I think first of all I think
Nagnako is very good player, very
talented. Um, and for Vitality, I feel
like I mean, they just have a a new
support, uh, which they have to probably
get used to on how they play the map. I
think they have an idea on how they want
to play, and I think they played
uh, good usually. I feel like today we
we just play much much better than we
usually do. Um, but going into playoffs,
I I don't really like I feel like for us
it would be too selfish to look to
playoffs right now. we first have to,
you know, get it and the first team we
have to beat is SK for that. And we're
going to put our focus first on SK
before we can even think about KC
because it's not guaranteed yet. And we
don't want to be too cocky. So, we're
going to be humble a little bit, you
know. Okay. Respect. We respect a humble
king. When it comes to the teams though
and the standings in general, what which
teams are you expecting not to be able
to make it to playoffs like at all? Do
you think because it is pretty close?
I mean, I
think I think BDS might not make it. GX
might not make
it.
Um, and everyone else was below. I guess
I guess Rog already out. So, but
mathematically they're not like quite
out like they're just about hanging on
there, but somewhere in another universe
or in this universe or whatever
universe, but it still leaves one more
team. There's SK, right? Yeah, there is.
Um, what is the standings right now?
There's three and
can we get a check on We had that
earlier. We could bring the standings
back up maybe because this is Oh,
they're two and four actually. I can see
it on the on the nice little screen. Oh,
um, eyesight 2020. Okay. U, we get those
standings at some point and we'll come
back to that discussion. And you're
talking about yourselves and like how
you don't want to be too greedy in terms
of like looking forward and being in
playoffs and whatever the else that
might be. But I I would assume that the
goal has always been playoffs. I mean,
the goal is to win the split. Yeah.
Stunning. Yeah. I mean, obviously for
us, it's always to win the split to be
the best in Europe. And this is not like
this this objective didn't fade at any
part of the the split. Obviously,
starting the split, we had a really
great start 3-0 into 03. It's not
something we, you know, like usually I I
feel like this was probably one of the
longer losing streaks we had uh in in
recent times, but yeah, I mean, our
objective is obviously to win. And I
feel like it started today. I I truly
believe it. I feel like it was a very
big breakthrough series we had, not
because of the gameplay, but because of
how we mentally prepared for this game,
and hopefully also for the games in the
future. Yeah. Well, we've seen the
standings, and you're right, Ske is also
hovering towards that bottom. So I guess
it means that you're just looking to
amputate from Wow. You know, however it
stands right now. Yeah. Respect. Right.
I mean, Alex, looking at G2 today, we
had a lot of discussions as well when we
were sitting on the desk like, okay,
well, it looks like they're back. It
feels like they're back. Is there
anything that you want to highlight here
that you are thinking, okay, this is
what I want to see less of terms of
seeing less of. I mean, I'm happy with a
lot of stuff they showed today, so
that's kind of hard to pick stuff out.
So I look at this on the spot. Yeah, cuz
I mean the last time we saw you guys
wasn't a big fan of the last couple of
drafts you had in Madrid. I think there
was a little bit you were cooking but
there was smoke coming from the kitchen
maybe a little bit. Feel like that was a
lot um more stable today. Of course I
love that creativity and I suppose I
suppose if there is one thing to take
away it's to bring back some of that
creativity in a way that we saw but
maybe some of the Oh yeah, cuz you did
call him a meta slave. I didn't say
anything about that. I think that was an
quote. I didn't say anything about that.
That was Odo Omni, our good friend. We
can blame Odo Omni for that Well, is not
playing anymore. So,
okay. On that note, if you've had enough
League of Legends for today, uh if you
haven't actually had enough League for
today because this was like a quick 20
for both games. Uh the LTA is actually
playing with 100 TE's against Dignitas
at 10 p.m. CST. So, that should be
pretty soon. The LC is going to be back
tomorrow with Heretics against Fnatic
and SK against Mcoy. Both of these teams
have a chance to lock themselves into
playoff. Mcoy and Heretics being and SK
if they somehow manages to actually
snatch away the win from Fnatic then you
know it's looking really good for them
and BDS and Rogue will be eliminated. So
high stakes all around. You genuinely
don't want to miss it. We're going to be
back again tomorrow same time, same
place and until then take care of
