Oh no, I'm running late. I don't have my
headphones plugged in. Oh, this is so
thrilling. Oh my god, I am rated. Oh,
pending. Also, we have my dog here today
in the room. Say hello,
Matcha over here. Good, good girl. Good
girl. Okay, I decided to do this because
like obviously they're not going to show
any Pokemon stuff today, but like
there's a lot of audience
overlap and uh Pokemon will be here
[Music]
eventually. New Mario Kart. This is my
jam. Radiator Springs. Let's go. It's a
little
cart.
Oo, I got I got to turn this up.
I love all the stickers on the
[Music]
carts. Ooh,
boats. Oh my god,
snowmobiles. A plane. It's like a glider
but different. Oh my god, these look
gorgeous.
That's so
sick. I love Mario Kart. I'm not I have
every cup, every CC gold trophy, three
stars on Mario Kart 8 and 8 Deluxe. You
could they wall jumping. Oh my god, it's
a
cow. Wait,
big. Oh my god.
What? Wait,
what? You can character customize during
the
race. Oh, the Oh my god, this looks so
insane. Mario Kart
[Music]
World. Hell yes.
I love Mario Kart. Oh my god, it's all
downhill from there. That was electric.
Barely drinking my coffee. I don't know
if I need much more. Tell me everything.
The wall writing is insane. Mario Kart
series is launching exclusively on the
Nintendo Switch 2 system. Welcome to
this vast
world. Cart races are held throughout
various regions that span the globe.
Interesting. So, it's one big map.
Depending on the time of day and weather
conditions, the atmosphere will change.
[Music]
Oh, that's so many people. And in this
Mario Kart
game, you can go off the racetrack and
drive virtually everywhere in this
world. Huh?
In the classic. That sounds illegal.
Through four courses in a bid for first
place.
giraffes. But don't sleep at the wheel.
You'll also drive to the next course as
part of the competition.
With 24 drivers in each race, the most
in series history, the competition is
gearing up.
24. And you have to drive between
tracks.
Race nonstop from one corner of the
world to another.
Oh my god. There are multiple
checkpoints along the way. If you're
below the placement shown when you hit a
checkpoint, you'll be eliminated.
Oh, Mario Kart Battle Royale.
Free roam. You can also freely drive
around this vast world in free roam.
This is a crazy way to do this. Going
off road, you can explore new areas and
routes. So drive wherever your heart
takes you.
[Music]
Wait, you can also go scenic drives with
friends. An open world Mario Kart
location.
Wait, was that Dino Dino Jungle?
I recognize that dinosaur stomping. The
world starts
here. Mario Kart
World. The game launches on the same day
as Nintendo Switch 2. Hell yeah. I saw
that date and I was like, "Wait, they're
dropping the Switch 2 in 2 weeks." I
have to keep petting my dog Matcha or
else she'll start licking her own
butthole. Uh, and I cannot tolerate that
in my vicinity. So, I'm distracting her
by petting her head. If you lick your
butthole, you will be kicked out. Let's
take a look at some new experiences it
offers.
C for cash money alone.
Damn. Discord.
Wait. No. No. No. No. No. No.
Nyx, I'm coming for you. No.
Introducing just built-in voice chat. I
think that has its applications. It's
kind of cool. I I worry about the chat
feature. Your voice is recognized by a
microphone built into the system. Oh,
okay. But you're still behind me, right?
From that far away. It can pick up your
speaking voice clearly even from a
distance. When it's noisy around you,
your voice will still come through
clearly, letting you chat with ease. How
did you get hit by a bow? I don't
believe you. I feel like it would work
better in handheld mode just cuz you're
going to be so much closer to the mic.
Good job. Good job. Oh, you can screen
share your game. Wow, that's that's some
impressive tech abilities. Just like go
on top of that dinosaur. Really? They
could do that? They can do it, you guys.
I just did it.
Oh, shoot. You go on a dinosaur.
Discord's going to be furious.
Okay, the C stands for chat. A camera.
By connecting this camera to the system.
Hey.
Hey. What's up? Hello. That's very
silly. I think some people could get
some good use out of this. I'm in a
unique position to where like I have a
Switch dock on my PC and the people who
I'm chatting with while I'm playing
Switch are often also John who also has
it on their PC. Wait, the head thing is
funny.
Is Was that I missed it. Is that Does it
actually do that? But yeah, I uh like
since I do most of my like a lot of my
Switch playing here at the desk, I just
talk with this camera. you're seeing me
through and the mic that I'm speaking to
you all together. So, it's not as much
this this is not very specific to me,
but obviously I'm the minority here. So,
I mean, I think it's a cool feature if
it works. On Nintendo Switch, even if
you just have one game, you can pass a
Joy-Con controller to a friend and play
together. But on Nintendo Switch 2, you
can play together locally on multiple
systems using just one game with Game
Share. Oh, that's nice. clearly share
compatible games. It takes two and split
fiction do essentially the same thing.
And that's like you can share a game
with other systems at a time. More games
should do that.
So I think it's really nice they're
doing. We got live selected. Oh well.
Bigger screen, same thickness at 7.9 in.
It's a weird way to phrase that. A
bigger built-in screen. Here's how that
compares to Nintendo Switch. The
system's thick with approximately double
the pixels compared to Switch. You can
enjoy games in greater detail on the
1080p screen.
Okay, that's nice.
Oh, the screen supports up to 120 frames
per second, allowing for smoother
gameplay in supported titles. The LCD
screen is more vivid and supports HDR,
providing more contrast between light
and dark areas of the images.
Nice. The all-new Joycon 2 controllers
connect
magnetically. Strong magnets keep the
controllers firmly attached to the
system. Detach your controller easily by
pressing the release button on the back.
Okay, I think that's pretty good design.
The SL and SR buttons are bigger. Okay,
those being bigger is huge. I hate using
the small ones on regular JoyCons. Yeah,
I I hate the little JoyCons are
nightmares. left and right stick.
Whatever you can do to make that better
is good. What? Each Joycon 2 controller
can be used to play with compatible
games. Both the left and right Joycon 2
support mouse controls.
That's wild. By adjusting the audio
balance between the ranges, sounds from
the built-in speakers are clearer and
more natural in handheld and tabletop
modes.
It has a built-in microphone so you can
voice chat with friends. I I find it
hard to believe that a microphone that
looks like that will sound
us to filter. I don't know. Maybe my
memories are just coming from the DS
days,
which was a long time ago. Now, in
addition to the port found on the bottom
of the system, there's one on top as
well.
That's really nice. So, you can charge
it while playing in table. for
connecting a USBC
camera or charging in tabletop mode.
Mhm. Yeah. You literally can't could not
do that on the original Switch.
Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256 GB of
internal storage, eight times that of
Nintendo Switch for storing your game
downloads, huge, save data, and more.
That's great. And writing data is also
faster.
4K support. Use the Nintendo Switch 2
doc to connect to your TV and enable up
to 4K resolution for compatible games.
Hell yeah. HDR is also supported in TV
mode.
It said it the frame rate's maxed at 60
fps for 4K. The Nintendo Switch dock. If
it gets up to 60, I'm good. This helps
keep performance stable.
Nice
play compatible switch. You can play.
Some may not be supported, but as well
as I feel like it's really just like
Labo type stuff. We're also releasing a
new pro controller. I don't like how
that D-pad looks. It has a C button
which launches game chat. And on the
back there are new GL and GR buttons
which you can use to existing button
controls.
Oh, I guess there more customizability.
That's nice.
But yeah, the Switch Pro Controllers
D-pad sucks. And so the official wary of
the new one. Nintendo Switch 2 launches
on June 5th. Oh, that's not far.
So, please wait a little bit longer.
I mean, I guess I knew it was going to
be a short turnaround, but oh my god.
The first type is Nintendo Switch 2
games.
These games take advantage of the
performance and features of Switch 2.
The second type is compatible games that
were released on Nintendo
Switch. Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games
are the third
type. Some games that were released on
Switch will receive upgraded versions
that offer things like improved visuals,
unique ways to play on Switch 2, and
more. Now, I'd like to show you Switch 2
edition of Super Mario Party Jamberee.
Please take a look. This is not a game I
felt needed a visual update. This game
is great already. Super Mario Party
Jamberee is getting an upgrade on
Nintendo Switch
2. The upgrade expands on the base game
and adds new features, including mouse
controls,
[Applause]
audio recognition,
more Aggressive rumble.
I love Mario Party Jamberee. I don't
think I'm going to get this. The the
voice control mini games sound like a
nightmare. And this is I think I feel
like the novelty of the face stuff in
game would wear off very quickly. Next
up is Mario Party mode. With a single
camera, up to four players can join the
festivities.
You'll be able to see each other's faces
as you play, so you can experience all
the reactions and emotions in real time.
That guy's
Bowser Live, a mode where the team wins.
Bowser will bring you on stage to hit
blocks to collect the most coins.
Guide an RC car with your
voice and compete in other mini games
using full body movement and sound.
Finally.
Yeah, I I have concerns about how well
that would work. I feel like I get too
competitive playing Mario Party and if
the controls aren't working how I want
them to, I'm just going to be like,
"What the hell?"
Plus, Legends ZA, which is Oh my god.
Yes. will not only receive a Nintendo
Switch version. I knew it. Nintendo
Switch 2 edition as Oh my god, it looks
so much better. Taking advantage of the
power of Switch 2. You can enjoy your
adventure in Lumio City with enhanced.
Oh my god, the frames. There's so many
of them.
Yeah. Hopefully the upgrade packs aren't
very expensive, but like I'm so happy
that ZA is getting a Switch 2 edition.
Oh my god, I thought I I thought that
was going to happen and then I started
to get worried that it wouldn't happen
cuz I didn't talk about it. But that
that's that's huge. That was immed. You
saw how the frame rate it immediately
looks so much better. Okay, they're
probably saving some of the bigger long
observed the lands. Who is
this? It's Elden Ring is in dire need of
repair.
Look at me. I know video games. I've
never even played this game. I'm not
going to. I don't like games that are
hard. Our first
ever an immortal witch out to vanquish
the sinister titan of times. I love the
underworld to the ends. I have never
played Hades 2. I'm waiting for 1.0.
Story that reacts to your every set back
and victory.
I played Hades on the Switch. I liked
being able to play it on like flights
and stuff. Look for I don't know if
they've announced when it's leaving
early access, but like I will be playing
Hades 2 on the Switch, too. To come to
Nintendo Switch. Hell yeah. Fantastic
game.
Fantastic game. This game is You should
play it.
I don't know if it'll look as good on
Switch 2 as it did playing on my PC.
You're going to love this one. Trust me.
But like you need to play You need to
play Split Fiction regardless of the
platform you're playing it on. Like it's
so good. It Takes Two. They're both
masterpieces. I don't know what's going
to happen the rest of the year, but I
Split Fiction is already like my pick
for game of the
year. Even though It Takes Two already
won it a few years ago and they're
similar, I think Split Fiction just like
really amplifies it. We'd like to show a
game being developed in collaboration
with Nintendo. Please take a look.
Back to Nintendo
games. I don't recognize that logo or
that
one. That is Zelda. The Jonai who
descended from the
heavens joined hands with the Hilians
who dwelt. Is this like Hyrule Warriors?
Their union led to a great and
prosperous kingdom.
But like a new one. But in time, a
terrible evil
arose. A war was fought to vanquish this
evil. one which future generations would
call
the imprisoning war.
Perhaps you truly have traveled back in
time. Wait,
so that's what Hyrule Castle
the store. That must mean this really is
the past.
[Music]
Okay, this has got to be Yeah. Okay,
this is Hyrule Warriors, but a Tears of
the Kingdom version. I never played
Hyrule Warriors,
so but if you're into that,
congratulations. Wow. Okay, that's just
literally
that sick logo. What is it?
[Music]
Nintendo Switch Online Plus expansion
pack will be getting a new classic game
library exclusive to Nintendo Switch 2.
Nintendo Gamecube, originally released
in 2001. Here are the titles that will
be available at launch. A Legend of
Zelda game that looks like a cartoon
come to life through cell shading.
Controlling the wind using a mysterious
baton. Link set sail on an adventure
across him. The Legend of Zelda.
Probably not. They don't have Ruby
Sapphire on the Game Boy Advance
expansion pack. Tale of Souls and Swords
eternally retold. You never know. More
titles will be added in the Oh, XD
[Music]
Coliseum Nintendo Gamecube. Can you get
them? Can you get the Pokemon off there?
I might be buying Nintendo Gamecube
exclusively available. Might be buying a
few of
those. Actually, that's those are
probably going to be like hard to I
think those might be scalper targets.
Nintendo GameCube. Nintendo classics.
Of course, you can continue. I can't
believe they put Coliseum XD on there.
That's crazy. I can't believe they did
that. But can you get the Pokemon off of
the games? That's my big
like will they let you do that cuz it'd
be a much easier set of steps than it
currently is. Is this
Astraineir? Is this Astraineir with
animals? Are they making Astronineir 2?
[Applause]
This was not on my bingo
[Music]
card. Star
[Music]
Secret. That's okay. That's exciting.
All right, we're nearing the last little
bit. The final thing they show in this
should be pretty crazy. It should be a
first party thing. I'm going to guess
new 3D Mario.
because haven't gotten that in a long
time. Odyssey
really. Wait, human fall flat
2. I love human fall flat. I mean, it'll
be human
fall
round. The last from our publishing and
development partners. Okay, one more
game that is third party, I guess.
I don't know who that
is. Did I know who that is?
I give
you my blood.
Don't do that. That's unsanitary. I give
you my
life.
Turn a
wheel and transport
him to a night of moonlight.
This does not to humanity's very look
like my vibe.
There are some kind of games like this
that I have
played, you know, where they're like
bloody and stuff. Balders's
Gate. I'm playing Assassin's Creed
Shadows right now. It's really
fun. Wait, From Software?
Whoa, a British From Software
game.
Wait, that train looked futuristic.
Well, yeah, the the the the spooky
gothic stuff. I I don't tend to I like
my bright colors, but what am I looking
[Music]
at? Is this a new
Bloodborne with jetpacks? Oh,
yikes. Oh,
yikes. If I played this game, that would
be what I my reaction would be a lot.
Oh, he's a vampire. Ew.
Ew.
No. Take my back to Pokemon.
Four minutes left in the
hour. This should be the big final
thing.
What?
Kirby. I wasn't expecting
Kirby. That
Oh.
Oh, hang on, buddy.
[Music]
[Laughter]
What? Wait a
[Music]
second. Is this Kirby? There's no way
this is Kirby Air
Ride. Oh, it's Kirby Air
[Music]
Ride. That's
insane.
Oh, you got me good. I didn't see that
coming. That's crazy. I have the
original.
that open world map where you like find
secrets in the buildings and the volcano
and stuff.
Okay, now is our last trailer.
Okay, I'm having a good
morning. This is our Mario. I can
already
tell. And it looks crazy. What is that
giraffe thing? Why are there rocks
walking around with
eyes? Oh man, it's beautiful
though. Ingot
Isle. Monkeys
mining. Come on, Mario. Get out of
[Music]
there. Wait, you are not Mario. You are
a monkey.
Why are your eyes so close
together? Oh, what? No, it's all just a
DK game. It's a 3day 3D Donkey Kong
game. And he
dig he
rock. That's why everything is like
crystal. They got to let him break it.
[Music]
What? This looks fun as hell. I love
punching
[Music]
things with some 2D
segments. The crystal things. Oh my god,
he was excited about that
banana.
Banana
banana.
Uh-oh. Oo, bad
guys. Bad monkey.
[Music]
Oh.
Donkey Kong Bonanza. That looks so
fun. That looks so
fun.
Action. Donkey Kong.
[Music]
Wow. You could just demolish everything.
That's That's my kind of
game. They haven't told us how much it's
going to cost.
Okay,
nice. Oh, this is the UK stream I see
now because of the
ratings. That was crazy. That was crazy.
A lot of good stuff.
