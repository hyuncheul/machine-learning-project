right into the video. Right into like
the Nintendo. Ah, it's good. Oh, it's
going to be a cold open. It's going to
be a cold open of
Mario. Oh, I hope we see Koisumi. He
hasn't been around enough. He's been
busy working on the new Mario and he's
going to show it to us in 15
seconds. Okay. Yeah, it's real now. It's
real. It's
real. Cold open.
It's
real. It's not a cold open, but I still
like it.
Is anyone else's heart kind of going
fast? Is that just
me? Okay, I'm I wonder if that's going
to be some game related
thing. It
is actual gameplay. Oh yeah. Oh, it's a
maker.
[Music]
Let's go.
Let's

water. Whoa, that's a big

tracks are cool.

Oh, so many
characters. What on earth? What is that?
You can eat a hamburger.
Oh, let's go.
You need a burger
costumes.
Oh, what's that magic hoopa doing?
Oh, world.
[Music]
Ooh.
Ooh. Oh, man. Hello everyone. I'm Koi
Kamoto and I'll be one of your guides
for today's Nintendo Direct. Oh man.
I'm the producer for Nintendo Switch 2.
I'm Takuhiro Dota, the director for
Nintendo Switch 2. I don't know these
guys. And I'm Tetsia Sasaki, the
hardware design lead for Nintendo. Look
at them younger guys. You just saw Mario
Kart World, launching exclusively on
Nintendo Switch 2. Now, what do you
think this brand new Mario Kart game
will be like?
Uh,
fun. There's so much to take in. A brand
new entry in the Mario Kart series is
launching exclusively on the Nintendo
Switch 2 system.
This vast world
cart races are held throughout various
regions that span the globe. No way.
Depending on the time of day and weather
conditions, the atmosphere will change.
No. What?
That's so cool. It's all connected.
You can go off the racetrack and drive
virtually everywhere in this world. No
way.
In the Classic Grand Prix, race through
four courses in a bid for first place.
But don't sleep at the wheel. You'll
also drive to the next course as part of
the competition.
That's so cool. With 24 drivers in each
race, the most in series history, the
competition is gearing up. Oh man.
Introducing Knockout
Tour. Race non-stop from one corner of
the world to
another. There are multiple checkpoints
along the
way. If you're below the placement shown
when you hit a checkpoint, you'll be
eliminated.
Cool. Oh, that's fun. You make it all
the way to the finish line.
You can also freely drive around this
vast world in free
roam. By going off-road, you can explore
new areas and routes. That's so cool.
So, drive wherever your heart takes you.
You can also go for scenic drives with
friends and even take photos together at
different locations.
You can't get out of your cart, but who
cares?
A brand new race across the entire world
starts here. That's unreal. Mario Kart
World. That's unreal. launches on the
same day as Nintendo
Switch. More details about this title
will be shared in an upcoming Mario Kart
World Direct, so be on the lookout for
more information in the future.
Oh man.
Mario Kart World launches on the same
day as Nintendo Switch 2.
We'll share more details in the future,
so we hope you're looking forward to it.
Yep, there you go. There's your launch
title.
Next, we'd like to introduce some of the
new features of Nintendo Switch 2. I
would like to see them.
These are the Joy-Con 2 controllers for
Switch
2. And on the right Joycon 2, we've
added a new C
button. Let's take a look at some new
experiences it offers. Some new
experiences.
I'm still ahead of all you guys. Uh oh.
Got a little lag.
That was you. So quick.
Wait. No. No. No. There it is. It's
chat. Nick, I'm coming for you. Oh, I
hope they fixed that lag.
Introducing Game Chat, a new feature for
Nintendo Switch 2 that Nintendo made up.
Hey, what's up? Can you hear me? Hello.
Hi. Missed you. With this feature,
you'll be able to communicate with
friends and family while playing a game.
Should we follow you? Yeah. Cool.
While using the game chat feature, your
voice is recognized by a microphone
built into the system. There is a
microphone. Nice. All right, let's keep
going. It can pick up your speaking
voice clearly even from a distance.
Really? Jump on here.
All right, let's keep going. Let's make
a left right here. When it's noisy
around you, your voice will still come
through with ease.
Okay, nice. Nice. It does look
beautiful. It's And you can use this
feature in handheld mode, too, letting
you chat with friends and family.
If you open the chat menu and turn on
game screen sharing,
good job. There we go. There we go. You
can also share your game screen. Did you
see someone just like go on top of that?
Super choppy, but still cool. You guys,
I just did it.
Oh, shoot.
Oh, he's trying to eat me. He's trying
to eat me. Okay, I got in. I got in.
Okay.
Oh, Animal Crossing. You say even while
playing different games. Yeah, I know.
That one so hard, right? It's tough. Oh,
one of these like in the sky right here.
Different games.
Look, you're a star. That's so cute. So
cute.
You can adjust the size of your game
screen.
Guys, I'm lost. Like, where' you go
or expand another friend's game screen.
You got to get above above that wall
that's to your left. You're almost
there. It's just like the wall. Like if
she gets past the wall. Well, they're
not lying. They're not lying to us. It
is choppy. They're not trying to hide
it. So everyone can watch them play. Oh,
I think I I think I know where you are.
I think I know where you are. Wait,
wait, wait, wait. Okay, I think we have
Oh, nice. This is really cool.
Even with the limitations, this is cool.
This is unreal. On the right Joycon 2
controller, there's an additional
button. With the C button, you can pull
up a chat menu.
Oh, dang. really actually guys uh I got
a call coming right now so uh I'll be
right back. Yeah. Oh yeah.
Here you can quickly and easily mute
yourself and more. There's this.
Wow. Separate camera connecting this
camera to the system.
No way. No way. Hey, what's up? Hello.
Hi. How's everyone doing? Good. You can
appear
and video chat while playing the game.
Here's how it looks with just the camera
feed.
There you go. I bet you like that. Can
you wait for me? Oh, no. That's so cool.
Use your camera feed like this.
Left a little more this way.
Using game chat, even when you're apart,
you can play games and hang out as if
you were together in the same room. Play
together or compete in online
multiplayer games.
Chat while playing your personal
favorites.
Decide your own rules for a retro game
competition or hold a sports competition
between families.
All together.
Got to get the camera bundle now. Great.
What did you think? In developing Game
Chat, our goal was for you to enjoy
playing online with others more closely,
including family and friends. Almost as
if you're all playing together in the
same place.
The camera you saw in the trailer is the
Nintendo Switch 2
camera, which will be available on the
same day as Switch 2.
A Nintendo Switch online membership will
be required to use Game
Chat. However, since we'd like as many
people as possible to experience Game
Chat, it will be available without a
membership for a limited time. We hope
you'll try it out.
That's cool. Additionally, Game Chat
supports the Nintendo Switch parental
controls app and different settings can
be adjusted. For example, whether
parental permission is always required
when a child wants to use Game Chat to
play with their friends.
We'd like to introduce another new
experience you can share with family and
friends.
On Nintendo Switch, even if you just
have one game, you can pass a Joy-Con
controller to a friend and play
together. But on Nintendo Switch 2, you
can play together locally on multiple
systems using just one game. Oh, cool.
With Game Share, as shown here, even
games that require multiple screens can
be played if one person owns a
compatible game. With GameS Share, you
can temporarily share compatible games
with others who also have Nintendo
Switch 2 or a Nintendo Switch system. A
wild new feature game with up to three
other systems at a time.
Game Share also supports online play
with other Switch 2 systems, and you can
use it with friends via Game Chat, which
we showed earlier.
Game Share can only be used with
compatible games. This feature is
planned for several titles, starting
with a free update for Clubhouse Games
51 Worldwide Classics on Nintendo Switch
for older games. That's cool. Game share
support is also planned for select games
exclusive to Nintendo Switch 2, so we
hope you'll look forward to it.
Up next,
we'd like to show you the Nintendo
Switch 2 system itself. Fix the audio.
Please take a look. It's like a second
and a half off.
Same thickness. I thought it was going
to be thicker. Switch has a bigger
built-in screen. Is that a boss? That
compares to Nintendo Switch. The
system's thickness remains the same.
Cool.
With approximately double the pixels
compared to Switch, you can enjoy games
in greater detail on the 1080p screen.
Expected up to 120. The screen supports
up to 120 frames per second, allowing
for smoother gameplay in supported
titles.
The LCD screen is more vivid and
supports HDR, providing more contrast
between light and dark areas of the
images. That's good. It's not OLED,
but the allnew Joycon 2 controllers
connect
magnetically. Strong magnets keep the
controllers firmly attached to the
system. Detach a controller easily by
pressing the release button on the back.
the SL and they're usable now for
greater comfort and control when playing
with the Joycon 2 held horizontally.
The left and right sticks are now
larger. Each Joycon 2 controller can be
used as a mouse to play with compatible
games. Both the left and right Joycon 2
support mouse
controls. By adjusting the audio balance
between the ranges, sounds from the
built-in speakers are clearer and more
natural in handheld and tabletop
modes. It has a built-in microphone so
you can voice chat with friends anytime
via game chat.
It also uses noise cancelling technology
to filter sounds so your voice will come
through clearly.
Even if you don't have a surround sound
system, games can be
enjoyed three-dimensional sound as if it
were coming from all around you.
I do kind of want to refresh the page to
see if it helps the lag,
but I don't want to miss anything.
Place your Nintendo Switch 2 however you
like with a large sturdy stand. You can
move it freely like
this. In addition to the USBC port found
on the bottom of the system, there's one
on top as well. Sorry, going to refresh
real quick. There's one on top as well.
See if that helps.
Handy for connecting a USBC camera.
Sorry. Or charging in tabletop mode.
Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256 GB of
internal
storage that of Nintendo Switch for
storing your game downloads, save data,
and more.
Reading and writing data is also faster.
A yeah, use the Nintendo Switch 2 doc to
connect to your TV and enable up to 4K
resolution for compatible games. HDR is
also supported in TV mode.
Wow, fan ventilation. That's going to be
way more expensive. Doc has a built-in
fan that keeps your system cool. That's
why it's bulky to keep performance
stable. Why didn't we see that coming?
That was That should have been obvious.
On Nintendo Switch 2, you can play
Nintendo Switch 2 games as well as
compatible Nintendo Switch games.
Physical and digital games are
supported. Cool.
As you just saw, Nintendo Switch 2 isn't
simply an improved Nintendo
Switch. We redesigned the system from
the ground up and packed in lots of new
gameplay
features. And to help players better
understand the Switch 2 hardware, we're
currently developing this
game, Mr. Kawamoto.
Here's the gimmick game.
My current location is actually inside
the game itself.
Whoa. This is Nintendo Switch 2 welcome
tour. Oh, cute. Exclusive to Nintendo
Switch 2. That's cute.
I'm standing over here.
Okay, everyone, join me inside the
game. There are a lot of question mark
icons here. Let's examine them.
[Music]
This sign reads, "Where are the
magnets?" The Joycon 2 controllers
attach to the system with magnets. And
those magnets are inside the
system. The SL and SR buttons on the
Joycon 2 are made of metal. The buttons
are made of metal attached to the
system. That's cool.
A magnetic circuit is formed between
them, so they won't easily detach. Yeah.
How are these not me? That's true.
Through examining signs like these, you
can discover all sorts of secrets about
Nintendo Switch 2. Another example, the
Joycon 2 controllers have mouse
controls. And when combined with the
gyroscopes, you can even do something
like
this. You can adjust the position of the
golf club and aim for the cup by
rotating the Joy-Con,
too. By combining the mouse controls and
gyroscopes, things like this are
possible. Oh, mouse plus gyro to
discover even as you're playing mini
games and tech demos. Why didn't I think
of that? Some of the secrets range from
the unique features of the system to
tiny details you might not notice until
they're pointed out. There are plenty.
There are plenty.
Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour will
launch as a paid digital game on the
same day as Nintendo Switch 2. Paid. So,
please check it out if you're
interested. Okay, that's weird.
Now, I'd like to share some more
information regarding Nintendo Switch 2.
This is the game card for Nintendo
Switch 2 titles.
It's the same shape as Nintendo Switch
game cards. Everyone's like, why? And it
has much faster data reading
speeds. Next up is additional
storage. Switch 2 will only work with
micro SD Express cards.
They're a different type of SD card and
will make high-speed data transfers
possible. Please note the regular micro
SD cards used for Nintendo Switch will
not be compatible.
Additionally, to transfer data from
Switch to Switch 2, log into your
Nintendo account to use the system
transfer feature. With this feature, you
can transfer save data digital. How am I
behind?
We're also watching a new pro
controller.
It has a C button which launches game
chat and on the back there are new GL
and GR buttons which you can use to
assign existing button controls. Cool.
In addition, an audio jack has been
added. We've introduced a few new
features and after today's presentation,
the official Nintendo Switch 2 website
will go live. There will also be an Ask
the Developer article on the website
where the three of us will talk about
the development of Nintendo Switch 2. We
hope you'll check that out as well.
And now, the Nintendo Switch 2 launch
day.
Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th.
We're very much looking forward to the
day when you all get to experience it.
So, please wait just a bit longer. Oo,
early June. Oh, boy.
Now,
broadly
speaking, on Nintendo Switch 2, you can
play three types of games.
The first type is Nintendo Switch 2
games. Yeah, these games take advantage
of the performance and features of
Switch 2.
The second type is compatible games that
were released on Nintendo Switch. Yeah.
Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games are the
third type. Yeah, tell me. Some games
that were released on Switch will
receive upgraded versions that offer
things like improved visuals, unique
ways to play on Switch 2, and more.
Now, I'd like to show you the Nintendo
Switch 2 edition of Super Mario Party
Jamberee.
Please take a look.
Super Mario Party Jamberee is getting an
upgrade on Nintendo Switch.
The upgrade expands on the base game and
adds new features including mouse
controls.
Wow.
Audio recognition,
more expressive
rumble that uses a camera. Yeah, I was
wrong. We were wrong. Can be accessed
on three new and updated modes. And yet
it's sointend is Mario Party mode. With
a single camera, up to four players can
join the
festivities. You'll be able to see each
other's faces as you play, so you can
experience all their reactions and
emotions in real time or four friends
online. That's fun.
That is fun.
Up next, it's Bowser Live, a mode where
the team wins. Bowser will bring you on
stage blocks to collect the most
coins with your voice.
Whoa, it's the flower using full body
movement and sound. Finally, take a ride
on the mouse
control with the safety bar lowered and
secured.
You're off.
Use mouse controls to shoot down enemies
while you feel the bumps and rumbles of
the coaster.
Weird.
When you enter a pipe, a miniame will
begin. There's a bouldering game where
two players each control an arm and one
where you shake a can of spray paint and
quickly tag
objects. Enjoy the thrill of these
intuitive mini games. How quickly can
you reach the station?
From that camera, the built-in
microphone, the biggest party yet is
getting even bigger. That's so
surprising. Mario Party
Jambintend and yet it makes so much
sense. Nintendo Switch 2 players who
already own Super Mario Party Jamberee
can upgrade to Nintendo Switch 2 Edition
plus Jamberee TV by purchasing an
upgrade pack. Got to buy it.
Please look forward to a new Mario Party
experience where you can see each
other's reactions while playing.
Let's continue presenting some more
Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games. How
much you want to bet they don't give us
the price? Oh yeah, both of them. Yeah.
Switch two editions of The Legend of
Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend
of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
feature enhanced resolution and frame
rates. Yes.
Oo, look at that. Kiri Forest, which
makes the image more color, so you can
play with smoother, higher definition
graphics. Yes. Yes, please.
Plus, you can get even more out of your
adventures in Hyrule using Zelda Notes.
This new feature can be accessed via the
Nintendo Switch app on smart
devices. It's a game specific service
that's exclusive to the Switch 2
editions of these
titles. For example, weird help guide
you to various locations like shrines
and quorox you haven't found yet.
Guidance activating. Whoa, cheating.
Proceed north.
You can share your creations using QR
codes and send them to another player to
create in their game. That's
cool. That's cool.
[Music]
We hope these features will make your
adventures even more enjoyable.
Oh. Oh. In Kirby and the Forgotten Land,
you'll ble to enjoy an additional story.
No way. To the Nintendo Switch 2 edition
along with improved graphics and frame
rate. Oh, it's going to look so good.
This story takes place in the Forgotten
Land. Crystal Wolfy struck by a powerful
meteor that's causing some mysterious
changes. Oh man.
We hope you're looking forward to
Kirby's new
adventure. That's so cool. Ooh. Time for
Beyond will have both a Nintendo Switch
and a Nintendo Switch 2 edition.
Yes.
Yes. Oh, it's going to look so good.
In addition to standard controls, you
can use mouse controls for intuitive
gameplay on Switch 2. Oh man. Plus, you
can explore the immersive world in 4K.
4K 60fps or enjoy smoother action. Oh,
you can choose between quality
performance mode.
These two modes, both of which support
HDR based on your preference and play
style.
Yes, it's Pokemon 2. Pokemon Legends Z,
which is scheduled to launch later this
year, will not only receive a Nintendo
Switch version, but a Nintendo Switch 2
edition as well. Oh, yes. By taking
advantage of the power of Switch 2, you
can enjoy your adventure in Lumio City
with enhanced resolution and frame
rates. Oh, that looks so much better
even on the stream.
The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games you
just saw will be available as both
physical and digital versions.
And if you already own the Nintendo
Switch version of a game, you can play
the Nintendo Switch 2 edition by
purchasing an upgrade pack.
We hope you're looking forward to these
Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games.
Next, I'd like to introduce a brand new
game featuring mouse controls with the
Joy-Con 2 controllers. Finally.
Please take a look.
Wow. Yeah.
Oh, it is going to be arms, isn't it?
It's legs. It's legs. It's legs, people.
We're getting
legs. Rocket
legs. Legs. Basketball. All
right. Okay.
Why
not? You know, I don't want to judge it
too quickly. This will be someone's
thing, but wow. I super don't want to do
this. That's that by dragging them. That
looks
horrible. That looks really
uncomfortable. I don't know. Whatever.
I'll reserve
judgment. It's cool though.
[Music]
In Dragon Drive, you'll use the
inevitable motion control thing to
intuitively pull off various moves. We
hope you're looking forward to a new
twist on threeon-ree matches using dual
mouse controls.
Next, here are some games from our
publishing and development partners
coming to Nintendo Switch 2. Here we go.
Elden Ring. Elen Ring. Elden Ring. Elden
[Laughter]
Ring. Oh, they started with it. No way.

Oh, that's too funny. Does it come with
a DLC?
Hope so. If it run Yeah, if it runs
better than Steam Deck, I'm there.

Thanks for the warm welcome.
This planet will be ours.
The sovereign Axiom. Yeah. Demon X
knocking it too has almost completed a
weapon that was created to destroy all
humanity. No, because we're in the
middle of a war. Don't you get it? I
won't just stop you. I'll tear you
apart.
All it is Demon X Machina.
It had to be something else.
Okay, that's slightly surprising. Hey,
this is Joseph from Hazite. Slightly
surprising there. for Split Fiction to
come to Nintendo Switch. The game is a
story about friendship. You play as Mio,
who writes sci-fi, and Zoe, who writes
fantasy. Together, they get trapped in
their own stories. And it's up to you
and a friend to help them break free.
Now, let me tell you this. If you like

kingdom. But in time, a terrible evil
arose. A war was fought to vanquish this
evil. One which future generations would
[Music]
call the imprisoning war.
Is this I I mean I think we all have an
idea. You truly have traveled back in
time. You are kidding me. You what?
So that's Hyrule Castle.
No, that must mean this really is the
past.
What? It is a Warriors game, isn't
it? It is. Okay. I thought it was going
to be
Oh, wow.
