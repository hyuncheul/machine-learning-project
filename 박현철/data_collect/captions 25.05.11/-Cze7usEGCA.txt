Drivers, start your
engines. Welcome to Mario Kart World,
available exclusively on Nintendo Switch
2. What kind of races await you?
In Mario Kart World, you'll aim for
first place in each Grand Prix. But why
stop there? Across cities, plains, a
desert, and even the ocean, you can
drive virtually everywhere in this fully
interconnected
world. Races are held on courses
scattered throughout various regions
that span this world, and you can freely
drive between them.
There's a lot in store and we're only at
the starting line. Let's introduce some
of the courses that are waiting for you.
Here we
[Music]
go. Courses are found throughout the
world inspired by their surrounding
region. Let's take a look at some of the
new courses to explore.
[Music]
Ride the ridges and roads on Mario
Brothers
Circuit and cruise the curves around the
canyon. You can't miss
[Music]
it. See the sides and stylish structures
of Crown
City. You can even soar in style down
Main
Street, drift along the rapid waterways
of Salty Salty Speedway, and make a
splash around the city's canals.
Stay cool in the snowy trails of Star
View
Peak. Just don't slip off while soaking
up the
scenery. Have a spirited showing at the
ghostly movie theater
cinema. It's a whole new kind of
drive-in theater.
And in addition to lots of new
courses, there's Toads
Factory, Peach
Beach, Wario's Gallion, and
more. Nostalgic courses from past titles
are also here, but now they're
re-imagined and spread throughout the
world, where races can happen during the
day or at night.
[Music]
race as familiar characters like Mario,
Luigi,
Peach,
Bowser, and
Yoshi. Plus, new drivers like
Goomba,
Spike, and that's right, Cow.
Even more new racers are waiting and
ready to
roll. Select your
character. Choose your vehicle, then
you're off to the
races. Characters and vehicles each have
different stats, so make sure to find
the combo that best suits
you. There are two main styles of race
revving up in this world. Grand Prix and
Knockout Tour.
In both modes, up to 24 drivers can
participate, the most in series
history. Your rivals aren't the only
hazards you'll need to avoid on the
road. Look out for cars that shoot
bullet bills, attacks from hammer
brothers, and other obstacles along the
way. Try to steer clear.
And now, get ready for Grand Prix with
Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup, Star Cup, and
more. Grand Prix races are held all
around the game's world. You'll race
through four different courses in each
cup and aim for the top
spot. In Mushroom Cup, you'll start off
racing around Mario Brothers
[Music]
Circuit, while the second race will take
you from Mario Brothers Circuit to Crown
City. For the first time, you'll need to
drive yourself to the next course in
Grand Prix. So, keep your eyes on the
road. And if you conquer all Grand Prix
Cups, rumor has it that a certain
colorful course will
appear. Next up is a new mode, Knockout
Tour. From Golden Rally to Ice Rally and
more, these extended races take you from
one end of the world to the other.
Get ready for a sprint, but you've got
to place if you want to stay in the
race. Speed towards checkpoints
throughout the world. If you don't make
the cut, you're out of the running.
[Music]
Buckle up. The competition gets more
intense as you close in on the
checkpoints. You've got to drive to
survive in Knockout Tour. So, keep your
eyes on the prize and aim for first
[Music]
place. Items can drastically change the
outcome of a
race. Here are some new items that'll
help you out. Coin shell. When you throw
a coin shell, coins will appear. Now's
your chance to grab them. Just don't let
your rivals cash in
first. Ice Flower. With the ice flower,
you can freeze out rivals and send them
spinning. Hammer. Aim the hammer in an
arc and nailed it. Hammers also stay on
the course for a short time and can be
used to block off rivals. Mega mushroom.
With the mega mushroom, go big so your
rivals will go
home. Feather. Use the feather to jump
up and avoid
attacks. You may even discover some
unexpected
routes. Common. With comics magic, your
rivals will
transform. What other mysterious effects
will happen? You'll have to see for
yourself. The lower your placement, the
more likely you are to find items
that'll turn the tables. So, when you
get items, go for
it. And if you're new to the Mario Kart
series, there are added support features
to help you along the way.
These
include smart steering, which helps you
stay on the
course, tilt controls, where you can
hold a Joy-Con 2 controller horizontally
and use motion controls to
steer. And if you have the Joy-Con 2
wheel, you can feel like you're really
driving.
[Music]
Oo, how about a quick break? A snack
sounds good right about now. Hey, look.
It's a
[Music]
drive-thru. Here at Yoshi's, you can
grab an order to
go. Dash
food, take a bite,
and you can unlock outfits inspired by
your meal.
Eat some sushi
and wa nice
threads. Once unlocked, these outfits
can be selected from the character
selection
screen. Who knows what dishes or outfits
you'll find. Make a pit stop and check
out these drive-thrus all around the
world. That was a nice detour. Now,
let's get back to the action.
[Music]
Let's introduce some new tricks that'll
help you ace each
race. Charge jump. You can now use a
charge jump by holding the drift button
while driving straight ahead. Charge up
and release to
jump. Use this to leap over
obstacles. Grind along power
lines and dodge attacks from your
rivals.
[Music]
And if you jump toward a wall, you can
wall ride for a short period of
[Music]
time. Chain some tricks together and you
may even reach places like the Ah, so
close. Almost
there. Whenever this happens, be kind
and rewind. This will return your
vehicle to its original
position. Nice. made
it. This can come in handy when mapping
out how to best approach a
course. Keep in mind though, your rivals
will still move normally when you
rewind, so don't lose your
lead. Want to take a spin in even more
races? In time trials, it's you against
the
clock. Here you can race without any
other
competitors. And if you go online, you
can download and compete against ghost
data from racers around the
world. Customize the rules of the road
in versus
race. You can use the classic rule set
of running three laps within the same
course. Or you can choose to drive the
distance from one course to
another. You can even take the road less
traveled and choose routes that aren't
in Grand Prix or Knockout
Tour. Up to 24 drivers can now compete
in two, three, or even four
teams. Group up and get ready to put the
pedal to the metal.
[Music]
Next up, battle mode. You can pop off in
balloon battle, where you use items to
burst your rivals
balloons. And coin runners, where you
can go for the gold by collecting the
most
coins. Race or battle, enjoy whatever
drives you.
When you're not racing, you can enjoy
free roam and go wherever your heart
takes you. No roads, no problem.
Ride the
rivers, see the
seas, drive the
desert, or jump off from way up
here. You can go wherever you like, even
to the edges of the
world. Hey, there's a P switch over
there.
[Music]
Hit P switches you find across the world
to start
missions. By completing them, you can
hone your driving ability outside of
races. There are also hidden
[Music]
coins, hidden panels, and more. So, take
the scenic route and explore.
Also, during free roam, you can take
photos whenever you
[Music]
like. Strike a pose. Look at the camera.
Choose a frame to decorate. And nice.
That one's a winner.
[Music]
If one person has Mario Kart World, up
to four players can race in split screen
on the same
console. The game also supports local
wireless play. Up to eight players with
up to two players on each console can
race together this way.
And up to 24 players from around the
world can join a race or battle in
online
[Music]
[Music]
play. This may look like free roam, but
this is where you'll wait while your
friends join you.
Looks like someone's
[Music]
arrived. Yep. You can meet up with your
crew anywhere in this world. By checking
the map, you can quickly see where your
friends are and travel to their
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
location. Battle or race with custom
rules, or just go for a ride together.
Make this road trip your own.
[Music]
You can also take photos together along
the way if that's more your
[Music]
speed with Game Chat. Enjoy an expanded
experience by talking online with
friends. Use the built-in microphone to
voice chat while driving together. Yeah,
let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Check this
out.
Nice. Are you kidding me? Or take a back
seat and watch each other's game
screens.
If you have a Nintendo Switch 2
camera, you can enjoy seeing your
friends reactions while playing
[Music]
together. Who's close
by? Wait, who just passed me? You'll be
able to tell in an instant. Hey Michelle
and
Bullseye. And when playing together in
person on the same console, a single
camera can detect up to four people's
faces. Enjoy the view and get ready to
face off with your
friends. Heat. Heat.
[Music]
[Music]
A transcontinental race around the world
is just around the corner in Mario Kart
World, available exclusively on Nintendo
Switch 2. A hardware bundle that

World will also be available.
