Sh. John, are you going to actually do
something? It's been days and all we do
is sip coffee.
Hey, speak for yourself. I've been
working and I might have found
something.
Oh, Wong, you haven't caught on yet.
You're the bait in this trap.
You're charging premium rates here. I
better see some results.
Chill out. We're dealing with multiple
groups here, and I need to know who's
who before we make any moves.
Enough yapping all of you. Jang Chulan
on your feet.
[Music]
You got it, boss. Let's roll.
Hey, what?
Back off.
Yes, boss.
As I was saying, hey, Wong, I'll guess
they're after that special technique you
pulled on Jugo Ching, aren't they?
Dummy in a fancy
robe. Just give them what they want.
What's the big deal?
Straight to the point as always, Sister
Baba. But you know what? She's right.
What do you say, Sir
Tauist? Everything's temporary, right?
So why cling to it
real smooth?
Why don't you give up your chi genesis
then, Jungchulong?
[Music]
Trust me, I'd love to share the
knowledge for safety. Too bad I'm as
clueless as you
are. You might have a point, but I've
got my reasons for keeping this under
wraps.
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
Look at this amateur they sent. No
vigilance at all.
Purple shirt across the street. That's
our target. Copy that.
[Music]
Look, Wong, about these
stalkers. They're just hide muscle
bottom feeders. The real players got to
be those high and mighty ones we saw on
Longhoo Mountain. Messing with ordinary
folks is a serious offense. These mercs
know better than to cross that line. The
risk to your family is there, but it's
pretty low. Low risk is a no
risk. My family getting dragged into
this mess is my worst nightmare.
Real easy for you to play it cool. Jung
Chulon. Heard you've been kidnapped by
the Fulfilled. You should know better
than anyone what this kind of threat
feels like. Yeah, I know exactly how it
feels.
[Music]
[Music]
Okay.
like a locked door is going to stop
me. Listen up, Wong. I've got a plan.
We use these bottom feeders to trace our
way back to the real
players. Mind running point in these
photos, Sister Baba on it.
Mission accomplished. Let's pack it up.
Right. Don't lose him.
Where the hell did this one come from?
Sister Bow, you copy? Hello? Damn,
signal's
dead. Lost
them. Did I make a mistake?
Little
[Music]
Thunder.
Feel the thunder.
[Music]
In the
heart you
[Music]
Thunderous
thunderstorm in pursuit.
[Music]
Thunders got some moves there, kid.
Rules are rules. We took this contract
and we must get things done.
Taking our business is the last mistake
you'll make. If you're smart, get out of
the capital while you can. Easy there.
I'm new to this game. Still learning the
ropes. Maybe we can work something out.
I can learn from pros like you. Who's
dealing out these contracts? Let me join
your crew. Mind your own business and
don't get greedy. We're out.
They thought I was trying to steal their
job. Got played by their counter
surveillance. These guys are sharper
than our previous two groups. Game on
then. Let's see who's better at playing
dirty.
Hey. Hello. You there? What's with this
damn signal? Don't you let Hello, Sister
Baba. All clear on my end. Can you get
in touch with the Jugga
trio? Got something they can
help. I've got the full picture after
digging around for a few days. There are
three different groups watching you
walk. First groups local gang run by
this Bowo. Your name's Chenda Bowo.
Bow. Yeah. They've done plenty of dirty
work in the capital. Express has got
them blacklisted. They've avoided
getting
caught. Remember that van from the other
night? After leaving the alley, they
swapped
plates. Took all sorts of twists and
turns all around town before parking at
this old community.
Wong. How about you pop in for a
friendly chat? Me. With who? With Yao.
Who else? Find out who's pulling the
strings.
And he'll just tell me. Depends how
persuasive you can be. Get moving, Wong.
I'm not sure about this.
Hey, you hold it right there.
Beat it. Well, um I I need to see uh
Bow. Looking for Piao? More like looking
for a beatdown.
Sand in the wind. Oops. Didn't mean to
hit that
hard. Young Chulon surely found the
right spot.
He's barely home these days. Is there
something bothering him?
Of course he's bothered. You're always
in his ear about
something. No wonder he's never
home. Can't you keep that temper in
check?
No way. I can't even ask about my own
son now. I just care about him.
Save it. You figure this one out
yourself. I made sure to make Yay his
favorite cucumber dish today. Oh, my
makeup's ruined from all that garlic
crushing. Don't even think about having
any. Who's there? Wa. What the
hell? Great. Everyone's still awake.
Switch to
sand.
Geop. Anyone back there?
Help. Quit. Amazing how many people can
hide in such a small
hole pyramid.
Swift as
sand. They have been busy with the
camera, haven't they?
Happy birthday, May Love.
Bow got what I needed. Time to report
back to Jungu.
What
the? You're a real piece of work, Jung
Chulan. Charging premium rates just to
have your client do the work. Could a
combined power even match that of Master
Wong? Better let him handle it solo than
send in a clumsy
crowd. See, our boy Wong plays the lazy
slacker card pretty
well. But even the most detached guy has
an Achilles heel.
Family. Once something lights his fire,
he'll be different.
[Music]
[Music]
Fine, let's duke it out.
[Music]
Somebody stop
him after you. Let's check it out. Put
it
[Music]
[Music]
together. Holy crap. I'm going to buster
this guy.
Cut him off. Don't let him through.
[Music]
[Music]
Cheng, what's keeping you in the
capital? I mean, you're not on our
payroll yet. Here you are, next up in
all this. Why? Doubting my skills.
Hey, I never turned down free help.
Wong's probably wrapped things up by
now. Want to check in?
There are already people heading his
way.
Playing the mastermind, huh? Maybe we
should call you the next Jug Leon, aka
Juga Jr.,
that sounds so weird coming from you.
[Music]
Nice sprint. Next time, take the
elevator. Save yourself the workout. Oh,
this
[Music]
smartass. Tai chi crushing force.
Squir.
Sand
whip.
Hey,
hey
girl. Oh,
switch stop.
[Music]
Useless as sweet nothing. How'd you let
Wong tail you here?
Everyone take him down.
Like my kick, loser.
[Music]
[Music]
Tai Chi crushing punch.
You can't win this fight. How about we
talk
instead? Name your boss and you walk
free. Deal. You freaking Dallas boy
looking down on me. Are you? My lips are
sealed. What are you going to do about
it?
Got me there. Dear friend, Mr. Jung,
where are you when I need you? Step away
from me, Wong. Yay.
Tendyo, why are you here? Hey, I heard
that you got into trouble, May. I'm here
to settle the school.
Finally.
So your
Bows brother to you. Show some respect.
Whatever works for you. I only need one
thing. Give me your employer's name and
we're done here.
Oh, you want to meet the boss?
How about I gift wrap you and deliver
you there myself?
[Music]
I
you are
you
gear I'm going but I hate
You stand in the
wind. Ignis
flame. Get bold.
Huh? What are you?
I broke the eye. I'm going to beat you.
[Music]
What are you? She
meant Thundercl.
What are you looking at? Getting bold,
huh?
Santa,
huh?
[Music]
Geop. Oh, May. Oh, we're in over our
heads. Oh, I don't see a way out of
this. Theo, we can't both go down here.
I've got a plan. I'll hold W off. Run
while you can. May, you can't. Just I
get it. Okay. We'll be love birds in
another life when things are different.
Just promise me. Hate to break up the
drama, but your Romeo has already
bounced.
Tenafio, you spineless rat.
Live to fight. Another day, e you'll
see.
All that yapping while running away.
What did it do
first? Don't even try to trick me into
talking. All of you are spewing nonsense
out of your guts. Screw off all you dip.
screw off.
Yeah, I better hurry after
Bow. He He took off that way, right?
She's still hit so hard.
Forget it. We'll get answers when he
wakes
up. That shovel strike did the job. I'll
be out cold for hours.
Seriously, Junk. You called us in for
mere manual labor. Come on. This is
something big. The Express is sending a
big wig to handle Chenda Bao's case.
They want every detail. This requires
your expertise. You've got the
seniority. So, this needs your touch.
Ah, well, since you put it that way.
Classic Jung Chuan. Smooth talking as
always.
Wong, that scene you caused earlier
definitely raised some
alarms. We need to track the second
group as soon as possible. Holler when
you're good to go.
All this
effort, why don't we just
Are you suggesting
