hello everybody and welcome to the big
Nintendo Direct this is the live
reaction stream what you're watching
right now is last week so don't panic
this isn't new stuff that we're coming
in late on but we are going to learn all
about the switch 2 today I'm Ben Hansen
from minmax minmax is a place about
games friends and getting better thank
you all for being here I'm joined by
Kelsey Luen from mmax good morning I'm

mlan from minmax
prepping my screaming voice for
excitement I'm joined by Leo Vader from
minmax hello hi and we're joined honored
to be joined I should say by the one and
only shui
Yoshida
hello ym here late at night at Tokyo but
he promises he's going to try his best
to stay awake just for us because I
don't think we've ever seen the former
head of PlayStation or any of the big
three
react live to a console reveal from
another one of the big three I mean I I
am honored to have your action I mean
normally you just be sitting sitting
back on a couch watching this in your
own time so thanks for jumping in so we
can see your gut reactions to the reveal
of the switch too this is huge
man yeah I should look
impressed how much I mean are you still
in business mode are you able to just
relax and watch this as entertainment or
you think you're going to be analyzing
every single thing they do and think
like I wouldn't have done that on
Playstation well I I'm waiting for new
Mario Paint review oh that is the
biggest yes that is the big are you a
big Mario Paint fan oh no no because of
the mice thing they show just a classic
prediction yeah Y no I I'm right there
with you I think I think that could be
like a Mario artist did you play Mario
artist like the 64dd stuff back in the
day
Sho I didn't but I remember about that
okay yeah that is that is maybe what I'm
most curious about is they're going to
have maybe a pack in of some sort of
Mario Paint Mario artist type thing who
knows uh but we're going to learn all
about the switch 2 again this is Metroid
Prime 4 we got the switch one thing
about to pop in a couple of minutes here
any other uh hot predictions while you
stew on it and think about what those
predictions could be I want to give a
shout out obviously to Shu for joining
us on this holiest of holy days but also
uh you know he's here because we made a
large donation to extra life on his
behalf to Gillette Children's Specialty
healthc Care in St Paul Minnesota and so
there's a link in the description if you
would like to make a donation also in
sho's name if you think that he's it's
cool that he's here sharing his live
reaction to Nintendo you can help some
kids in the children's hospital here in
St Paul Minnesota via the old extra life
thing so greatly appreciate it but all
right predictions what do we got fast
and fast and loose here people I will
Scream the loudest scream if Twilight
Princess get remastered I will Screech
to the heavens a new console and you're
thinking about
remaster the GameCube
game okay hard stats okay no hard text
stats that's correct f-zero I hear it I
respect it and and and no hear me out
though it was a launch title for the
Super Nintendo and what is the switch to
if not the Super switch oo that's good
but would it be a sequel to f99 so You'
be like F0 100 um is that going to be
the angle they take for this Grand
Adventure who can say uh Leo what do you
got um it's really hard to predict what
their launch thing will be I feel like
they go a different angle with it so I
can't say it's going to be like Wii
Sports 2 or something so I'll say it's
some new surprising launch thing oh my

juggernaut yeah next we'd like to
introduce some of the new features of
Nintendo switch
2 these are the joyon 2 controllers for
switch
2 and on the right joyon 2 we've added a
new C button button who is that let's
take a look at some new experiences it
offers oh they do this
now uhhuh I don't rub it in all you guys
uh the the Nintendo video is out of sync
Just so you know it's not a tech thing
on our end that was that was you so
quick it's a
mic yeah it's just
disc every time someone joins with the
PlayStation
5 we get to have this
experience Jacob ni to the PlayStation g
a new feature for Nintendo switch
2 hey what's up can you hear me hello hi
miss you with this feature you'll be
able to communicate with friends and
family while playing a game should we
follow you
yes okay not Discord looks a lot like
Discord but I was going to say is that
Discord or is that Nintendo Discord
we're going to be running the podcast
through it no matter what in the future
so oh my gosh keep going can I'm
concerned about
that on the switch to Hardware around
you your voice will still come through
clearly letting you chat with East how
did you get hit by a boat
okay it does look beautiful it's and you
can use this feature in handheld mode
too letting you easily chat with friends
and family it's like the new we speak if
you open the chat menu and turn on game
sharing good J good job there this looks
super intuitive G screen did you see
someone just like go on top of that
dinosaur really they can do that they
can do it you guys are just did I want
oh shoot oh I was not expecting screen
sharing that's why
yeah what do you think
[Music]
sh you can chat to your content play
games just vibing with all your friends
that's very nice hard you know it's a
little choppy but like in the sky right
here I fell I'm falling I'm falling I'm
falling okay we got it we're safe we're
safe Kirby look your little star that's
so cute so
cute you can adjust the size of your
game
screen guys I'm lost like well this is a
great idea I want to like I feel nendo's
always so late to this t or expand
another friend game
screen that not look good that yeah that
didn't look great right but I really do
think if it's just like mostly it is for
having in the corner while you're
playing like the refresh doesn't really
matter that can watch them play true you
know if it's like it's just for kind of
playing Animal Crossing with
I and at least they're not lying you
know at least they're showing how choppy
it's going to be which is nice fair you
know plus one for not lying oh yo that's
sick I like your pose n on the right
joyon 2 controller there's an additional
button with the c button you can pull up
a chat
menu for chat have of got a call coming
right now so uh I'll be right back yeah
sure it's a job you can quickly and
easily mute yourself and more oh and
there's
thiso by connecting this camera to the
that's the least Nintendo looking thing
I've ever seen that looks exactly like
the original Oculus Rift sensor like it
looks like they bought a warehouse full
of them and put something on the top
how's everyone doing it's a console for
stream right you can appear on screen
and video while playing G and it
automatically like green screen screen
yeah that's
interesting here's how it looks with
just the camera
feed professional lighting please look
for to games which use your camera feed
like oh that's cool that's great that's
that's really cool
wa impressed
you yes
okay good good job using Game CH even
when you're aart you can play games and
hang out as if you were together in the
same room play together
or compete in online multiplayer
[Music]
games chat while playing your personal
this looks like it's going to be really
intuitive and just decide your own for a
retro game competition and I feel like
that'll be fun for kids to like see
themselves in the YouTuber streamer
gameplay oh exactly they all get to play
streamer with their friends yeah game
chat game
chat what did you think
in developing game chat our goal was for
you to enjoy playing online with others
more closely including family and
friends this is a smart feature to
encourage people to want to get the
newer one too it's like well we can all
play together talking not just play
together camera saw in the that Nintendo
switch 2 camera see weird glitches which
will be available on the same day as
video's coming in hot
apparently a Nintendo switch online
membership will be required to use game
chat okay here we go ever since like as
many people to experience I was that be
available without a m you're a lawyer of
course you'd expect that we hope you'll
try out oh first year fore interesting
wow additionally game chat supports the
Nintendo switch parental controls app
and different settings can be adjusted
for example whether parental permission
is always required child wants to use
game chat to play with their
friends we'd like to introduce another
new experience you can share with family
and friends
Nintendo switch if you just have one
game you can pass a joycon controller to
a friend and play together but on
Nintendo switch 2 you can play together
locally on multiple systems using just
one game all right that's great game
share I remember the even games that
require multiple screens can be played
if one person owns a compatible game
with game share you can temporarily
share compatible games with others who
also have Nintendo switch 2 or a
Nintendo switch system you can share a
game up to three other systems at a
time game share also supports online
play with other switch 2 systems and you
can use it with friends via game chat
which we showed
earlier okay game share can only be used
with comp games over just trying to
think different things are laying on top
yeah you can use it with game CH so does
that mean it doesn't have to be on
Nintendo switch I don't know what that
means game share support is also planned
for select games exclusive to Nintendo
switch 2 so we hope you'll look forward
to it up next specific games
okay we'd like to show you the Nintendo
switch 2 system
[Laughter]
itself please take a look
okay your
stats switch 2 has a bigger built-in
screen here's that compares to Nintendo
switch the system's thickness Remains
the the
same with approximately double the
pixels compared to switch you can enjoy
games in Greater detail on the 1080p
screen all right let this sink
in huh what the screen supports up to
120 you can play an NES game at 120
titles huh that's a lot more Marios I
mean I guess they is like 8K on all
playst SC is more Vivid and supports HDR
providing more contrast between light
and dark areas of the
[Music]
images the allnew joy-con 2 controllers
connect
magnetically strong magnets keep the
controllers firmly attached no ghost can
steal your controllers detach the
controller easily by pressing the
release button on the back
nice that's great the SL and Sr buttons
are bigger for greater comfort and
control when playing with a joyon wonder
if you no longer need the little like uh
thing that went on top look you need the
ra left and right sticks are now larger
how will you attach it to your R and
they won't drift Mouse controls each
joycon 2 controller can be used as a
mouse to play with compatible games both
the left and right joyon
that's like a SK by adjusting the audio
balance between the ranges sounds from
the built-in speakers are clearer and
more natural in handheld and tabletop
modes it has a built-in microphone so
you can voice chat with friends any time
via game chat it's going to be funny to
be able to clearly know who's playing
handheld and who's
playing 15 away on your voice will come
through
clearly even if you don't have a
surround sound system games can be
enjoyed with more immersive
three-dimensional sound as if it were
coming from all around
you 3D audio this is kind of Mark cern's
thing Sho I don't know if they can
really y they can't like claim to this
we have to send them a picture of our
you place your Nintendo switch 2 however
you like with a large sturdy
stand you can move it freely like no
really guys it's sturdy this time
Unbreakable
whatever the pl black boxes made out of
port found on the bottom of the system
there's one on top as
well oh that's neat it's handy for
connecting a USBC
camera or charging in tabletop mode give
us some Game Boy camera nonsense please
it's got to be baked in somehow
right goes perfectly with nintend
swi6 GB of internal storage eight time
that of Nintendo switch for storing your
game downloads save data and more
reading and writing data is also
faster oh
hello use the Nintendo switch 2 DOC con
your TV and enable up to 4K resolution
for compatible games all right HDR is
also supported in TV
mode Jacob this is the exact opposite of
your prediction all right well we're not
hearing anything about what's inside
it thiss perform
[Music]
stable and it's so
beautiful on Nintendo switch 2 you can
play Nintendo switch 2 games as well as
compatible Nintendo switch games
physical and digital games are supported
changes to the dog gear thing that's
perfect that's huge as you just saw
Nintendo switch 2 isn't simply an
improved Nintendo
switch we redesigned the system from the
ground up and packed in lots of new
gameplay
features and to help what not selling
you about this we rub it on the ground
we're currently developing this
game Mr
kaoto hello oh no down
there itself let's
go this is Nintendo switch 2 Welcome
tour yes exclusive to Nintendo switch
2 he should put us on I'm standing over
here okay everyone join me inside the
game I love this cute it's like a there
are a lot of question mark icons here
silic version of Nintendo
Land this sign
read asot right the joycon 2 controllers
attached to the system with magnets what
you think and those magnets are inside
the system oh this is so weird and Sr
button tells you how the system is built
I love this so that's how they attach to
the system anything to not print paper a
magnetic circuit is formed between them
so they won't easily detach
asot had the PS5 stuff but it wasn't
like it's a spaceship and flies around
it's like it has this type of GPU this
way another example joy-con 2
controllers have Mouse controls and when
combined with the gyroscopes you can
even do something like
this you can adjust the position of the
golf club and aim for the Cup by
rotating the joyon 2
huh by combining the mouse controls and
gyroscopes things like this are possible
you can see that there are secrets to
discover even playing Min games and Tech
demos some of the secrets range from the
unique features of the system I would
hope so if they're charging 70 bucks for
this we might have an
issue there are plent there are
plenty Nintendo switch 2 Welcome tour
will launch as a paid digital game on
the
same now like to share some more
information Nintendo switch

for people firmly in the switch
ecosystem this is opening up a whole new
world yeah these are show from our
publishing and development Partners but
for now we'd like to show a game being
developed in coll collaboration with
Nintendo please take a look in
collaboration what does that
mean oh okay another hro Warriors kind
of thing that could
be oh oh it is okay might be exactly
that descended from the heavens I mean
what else thean who dwell on the surface
their Union led to a great and
prosperous kingdom so this one's like
instead of the birth of the wild sequel
is the tears of the Kingdom sequel but
in time terrible evil
[Music]
arose a war was fought to Vanquish this
evil one which future Generations would
call the imprisoning
[Music]
war perhaps you truly have traveled back
in
time interesting play Zelda play Zelda
ra to that NE as of wisdom now it's
boring
well they keep doing it in these like
not that must mean this really is you
know not main Zelda G they were mad that
people were mad they didn't let you do
combat as Zelda and uh Echoes of wisdom
so now you can kill 1 million
boblin you get to be
ruol so you see the story leading into
tears of the Kingdom but it but it's
kind of in the middle it's like the time
travel thing gets confusing right yeah I
guess it's technically a prequel but
Zelda's
there it's like the war that happened
while she was there yeah which they
never really delved into in the game I
guess yeah so link wouldn't be there
right no age of imprisonment now we're
talking
interes my favorite
age
okay all
right that was hyro Warriors age of
imprisonment we still got like deved 20
minutes to it could just be nonstop

course weent hot
gorillas planet
perfect bananza perfect name I never
named anything Bonanza
yet oh good his eyes still do the thing
so July
17th action
game perfect perfect
word now who's making
it I think you're right te say
watch the credits to find out yeah
exactly yes we are
sir do you have a price prediction
sh 399 us
that me I'm wondering on the pricing
because oh that's a
really is Liberation day
today wow no price would they really
unless they're really embarrassed about
it do you think I mean it really could
just be up in the air right now is that
possible that it'd be up in the air at
this
point like when do you have to lock down
the price the website I guess we can go
to the website doesn't have anything
right
now that is
interesting all right um all right Shu a
guest of honor what do you think overall
um well actually it was underw until the
from sof game showed out yeah they
didn't have enough PlayStation games I
agree I don't know what they were
thinking that's the one that got you
okay so what what do you make of this
because from the outside it's easy to
see like is this what they did from the
jump from demon souls to Dark Souls this
is kind of their bloodborn spiritual
successor am I reading too much into
that bloodborne
connection yeah looks like yeah yeah
okay the world
setting yeah I mean what what stands out
to I think this is like a second party
Arrangement like Zelda uh Dynasty Bia
kind of set up yeah so so exclusive I
mean you know you know firsthand I'd
argue more than anybody else here
probably U just how difficult that is to
lock down from software with an
exclusive like this can you share any
insight into like how difficult this is
to to line
up well they haven't done anything like
this you know since bloodborne right
right so it's yeah it's it's
surprising yeah I mean do you feel like
if you were at PlayStation would you be
a little bit spurned do you feel like
it's I don't
know I'm sure the PlayStation F I no
longer work there so I understand but
you can imagine being a PlayStation fan
and then seeing this and being like the
bloodborne toot successor is exclusive
to switch that's so huge
uh well they wouldn't say it's uh
um and they got their Sony one Nintendo
gets to have theirs
two guess I guess the next logical step
yeah I also I do think even though we
saw it for like 2 seconds the confirmed
Hollow Knight 2025 right was not
something that we had before yes like
kind of assuming but like they also said
it was coming out last year so
yeah I think it's I think it's after
that okay yeah in kind
of it'll be hard to find yeah oh my God
yeah I mean I overall happy with it
weird that there's no price that seems
like the huge glaring thing we got the
release date I mean they can't put the
pre-orders up until that price you think
they would launch pre-orders on the same
day so it's really weird that that
wouldn't be up there this Bonanza game
looks so damn good yeah it does excited
for that although the lack of the
development team is really
odd uh yeah what about the hardware
itself Shu was what was most interesting
to you to see them kind of embracing you
know cameras and a lot of stuff you did
back with the PS4 I
suppose well they didn't talk about lumu
like hoptics uh so I was very curious
how they are there's definitely some
assumptions that the Donkey Kong game's
going to have some cool ones but yeah
that's going to rumble as you know it's
like they did talk resolutions and stuff
more than I thought but there is no hint
at what the internals are in terms of
like how much stronger is this than the
switch right yeah they'll get into
numbers but they won't have that level
of specifics but we'll leave it for
digital Foundry to go frame by frame and
try and piece together what this is or
you know they're going to be rolling out
information for the rest of this week so
you can kind of piece it there but shoe
overall overwhelmed underwhelmed review
it on a scale of 1 to 10 what would you
put this Nintendo Direct
at um I'd say six six you're a tough man
to
please until from sof game came
up and then it's 10 I I'll give it seven
wow okay what what would you what would
you do differently what would you want
to see more of well I I wanted to see
more new games announcement yeah there
are coup at the end but
uh mostly like a remake or
you know Port upgrade pack yeah a lot of
exciting third party stuff but that's
easy to do with like the benefit of
hindsight picking games we know we love
right over the entire lifespan of the
switch basically be like all right PLU
you pluck you pluck you yeah the whole
kind of connect aspect I feel like is
going to be interesting you know I mean
it is it started really nice with this
camera thing that's really neat and also
the being able to see other people's
game play you know even if it's a
different
game very nice yeah I'm worried a little
bit about having kind of those choppy
windows on the bottom like I think
that's going to make me sick I don't
know if anybody else feel I get
nauseated really easily and so that kind
of scares me just having those running
at the bottom all the time but it's a
cool
idea I think you can hide them yeah well
that'll be nice yeah MH I it's an
interesting like compromise between you
know Nintendo so often is like we want
to do something different we don't want
to just make like a more powerful
box and so calling it The Switch too is
kind of like well here's a more powerful
switch but I do feel like they sold this
has weird new things in it yes you know
it we didn't just stick a better GPU in
it I mean I don't know if any of the
Mouse stuff really sold me with all
respect to guard cross bike what what is
that called again drag Drive Dragon
Drive thank you yeah like that's it's a
cool idea was expecting like some pack
in game or something that would kind of
highlight the Mouse stuff but that's
that's the downside of no you have to
pay for that have to pay for that uh pay
for the pack manual to the
game cheap yeah price yeah I mean wait
20 bucks
ni if it's more than 10 it's
insane probably will be 20 one it's
insane
I that should be free 100% that should
be free
yeah oh oh prices are out prices are out
everybody
$449.99
apparently is it gonna be 500 with the
pack in okay hang on where's where's
everybody getting this let's see uh what
people are saying okay what does VGC say
$4.49 Okay gut reaction shoe what do you
think of the
price oh well higher than I had
anticipated everything price is higher
now so maybe you know
understandable the question is the
Japanese
price yeah for me right for you
personally yeah um I wonder if that
would be posted any what you what do you
think it's going to be let's see if we
can
find uh I just Googled switch to in
Japanese and I'm not seeing anything yet
but 449 without a game
okay yeah that's that's costly that's
it's interesting that they're not
putting that in the direct if they have
that info ready to go little little
shady you should you should put the
number in there for folks if they're if
they're going to be ordering this uh
Business Wire has the press release with
the pricing info okay yeah maybe there's
an email that went out to everybody here
I'll
see um okay 449 that's that's a bit
much it's not
50,000 that's big that's
unbelievably cheap considering you know
150 Yen per dollar right yeah
considering the weeken that
is everybody should go to Japan and
buy all right that is it literally
$330 uh direct
conversion wow interesting and then
shipping is at least 40 50 bucks yeah
and then we don't know if there's going
to be a tariff situation at that point
but I guess there would be either way
though yeah I think You' still yeah I
mean I'm wondering if it's one
possibility is it's Shady but the other
possibility is like they literally
decided like this morning or something
you know like things are changing so
fast and they couldn't bake it into the
video Yeah I think that's a that's a
forare of looking at it oh boy all right
well hey we'll be talking more about
