wait hold up
with game cards you can put a game
featuring Mario in this Nintendo switch
system and The Legend of Zelda game in
this one okay freely inserting the games
you have on hand into any system you
want right but what if digital games
could be as flexible and convenient as
game cards stop well here's what we came
up with introducing the virtual game
card
hold up future virtual game cards can be
used for digital games
okay hold
up when purchasing the digital game it
will be loaded onto your system as a
virtual game card right allowing you to
play that title
okay God the game is so nice games will
be lined up as virtual game cards on a
dedicated management screen okay is this
like Family Sharing load and eject your
virtual game cards and manage which
games you can play on your
system is this like a family like a
family system of like oh two Nintendo
switch systems you can Che a virtual
game card from one and load it on to the
second now you can play this game on the
second system wherever and whenever you
want just as you had inserted a physical
game card this is this is them setting
up you can fre load and ARR this is them
setting up for switch to and I'm so down

lent out for two weeks all right two
weeks they will automatically return to
you and say there will not be erased
games even easier to use you can give
your homies a twoe trial of a game and
then if they want they buy it
themselves the virtual card feature lets
you swap games between Nintendo switch
systems as well as to Nintendo switch 2
