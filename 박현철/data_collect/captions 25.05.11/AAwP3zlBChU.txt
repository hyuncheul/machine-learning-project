So, we had today probably the biggest
announcement in gaming for the entire
year. Have they ever had a two
before? I feel like this is the first
console that has a two next to it. It's
a Nintendo console. Yeah, this might be
the first
one. The Wii U. No, you not
too Yoshi's.
[Music]
Is this Red Dead Mario?
Let's go. Yahoo!
All
right, there it is. There it
is.
Oh! Oh!
[Music]
Looks nice.
[Music]
Sure. I would say the um the graphics
for this the graphics are good. I mean,
it definitely meets the check, right?
It's not like crazy good, but it's good
enough.
Looks like a PS3 game. Yeah, I I I know.
But the graphics don't need to be insane
anymore. Like, you've already reached a
point where graphics are good
enough. Focusing only on graphics
doesn't
[Music]
matter. Broken record. I know. I know.
You know, I've never actually played
Mario
Kart. Never got into
it. Yeah, I'm being serious.
Never. What can I say?
Hello everyone. I'm Koichi Kamoto and
I'll be one of your guides for today's
Nintendo Direct.
I'm the producer for Nintendo Switch 2.
All right. I'm Takuhiro Dota, the
director for Nintendo Switch 2.
And I'm Tetsia Sasaki, the hardware
design lead for Nintendo Switch 2.
What you just saw was Mario Kart World,
launching exclusively on Nintendo Switch
2. So, it's going to be a release title.
What do you think this brand new Mario
Kart game will be like? Probably like
every other Mario Kart
game. I'm going to assume it's going to
be pretty much the same. Entry in the
Mario Kart series is launching
exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2
system. It might have like Welcome to
this vast
world. Cart races are held throughout
various regions that span the globe.
Nice.
Depending on the time of day and weather
conditions, the atmosphere will change.
That's
cool. If it's like raining or
whatever, that's a lot of [ __ ]
people. And in this Mario Kart game, god
damn.
You can go off the racetrack and drive
virtually everywhere in this world.
Wait, what? That's kind of cool.
In the classic Grand Prix, race through
four courses in a bid for first place.
But don't sleep at the wheel. You'll
also drive to the next course as part of
the competition.
With 24 drivers in each race, the most
in series history, the competition is
gearing up.
This sounds pretty cool. I'm going to be
honest. Introducing Knockout Tour. It
sounds good.
Race nonstop from one corner of the
world to
[Music]
another. There are multiple checkpoints
along the way.
If you're below the placement shown when
you hit a checkpoint, you'll be
eliminated. Oh, it's like Fall Guys. Can
you make it all the way to the finish
line? Oh [ __ ]
[Music]
Nice.
You can also freely drive around this
vast world in free roam.
[Music]
That's cool. So, you can explore new
areas and routes. So, drive wherever
your heart takes you.
I think this is a really good idea,
especially for like just like kids that
want to [ __ ] around. This is that that's
smart for them to add that in. Very
smart. You can also go for scenic drives
with friends. Very good idea. Even take
photos together at different locations.
What the hell is that? New race across
the entire world starts here. That looks
really good. Mario Kart
World. The game launches on the same day
as Nintendo release title. More details
about this title will be shared in an
upcoming Mario Kart World Direct. So, be
on the lookout for more information in
the
future. Here's one of the big details
they didn't show on the
presentation. It's
$80. Everybody thought that GTA 6 was
going to be the one that's gonna make
the jump for like the increase in price
of video games. I don't think anybody
expected it to be Nintendo. It's $80 for
these new games now and $90 for the
physical copies. So, they're charging
even extra for that. And you get the
physical copies and it's not even the
entire game. Uh you have to it's
basically like a two-factor
authenticator that lets you download the
game from online.
Mario Kart World launches on the same
day as Nintendo Switch
2. We'll share more details in the
future, so we hope you're looking
forward to it.
Next, we'd like to introduce some of the
new features of Nintendo Switch 2. Okay,
what can it do?
These are the Joy-Con 2 controllers for
Switch 2. You know what those remind me
of? Those remind me of the controllers
from the Switch One.
And on the right Joycon 2, we've added a
new C button.
Let's take a look at some new
experiences it offers. Oh my god.
Ah jeez, gets my eye.
Yeah, I'm still ahead of all of you
guys.
[Music]
That was me. That was you. So quick.
Wait, what? Oh, no.
What? Wait, is this Discord? No, no, no,
no, no. Wait, what? N I'm coming for
you.
No. Oh, introducing Game Chat, a new
feature for Nintendo Switch 2. Hey,
what's up? Can you hear me? Hello.
So, Discord.
Okay, cool.
Hi. Yeah, missed you. So, they put
Discord in the game. You'll be able to
communicate with friends and family
while playing a game. I've always, you
know, my fantasy has always been to
while I'm playing Mario Kart, be hit by
the uh, you know, the blue shell and
then slowly lose to a 5-year-old that
whizzes past me screaming the
n-word. I I'm just I I I've been waiting
on this for a long
time. This is going to be great.
Okay. an adventure.
While using the game chat feature, your
voice is recognized by a microphone
built into the system. Okay. But you're
still behind me, right? All right, let's
keep going. Go get it. Can pick up your
speaking voice clearly, even from a
distance. Look at this. Jump on here.
All right, let's keep going. Come. Let's
make a left right here. Let's make a
When it's noisy around you, your voice
will still come through clearly.
I'll believe it when I see it. Do you
guys remember the old Xbox Live days
where it would be like one guy and like
every like his mic is just constantly on
because his mom's watching TV in the
background and there's like a baby
crying
letting you chat with E. Did you get hit
by a but I'll believe this when I see
it. Okay, nice. It does look beautiful.
It's And you can use this feature in
handheld mode, too, letting you easily
chat with friends and family. Mhm. If
you open the chat menu and turn on game
screen sharing. Great job. Good job. But
you can use webcam, too. You can also
share your game screen. Wait, look at
that.
So, you can use What the [ __ ] Did you
see someone just like go on top of that
dinosaur? Really? They could do that?
Can do it? You guys, I just did it. I
want to do it, too. Oh, shoot.
So, if this video was shot in
60fps and each frame that I go by is 1
FPS and each of the frames take about
five clicks to press, that means that
you were getting about 20 FPS by
watching
this. Huh.
Oh, he trying to eat me. He's trying to
eat me. Okay, I got it. I got it. Oh,
no. No, no, no, no,
no. Y,
you can chat to your heart's content,
even while playing different games. Wow.
Yeah, I know that one. That's a cool
feature. All things considered, that's
actually a pretty cool feature. Hard,
right? I like that. Tough. Oh, wow. I'm
like in the sky right here. I'm a I
fell. I'm falling. I'm falling. I'm
falling. Okay, we got it. We're safe.
Are they Kirby? Look, you're in a store.
That's so cute. So cute.
You can adjust the size of your game
screen. Uhhuh.
Guys, I haven't played Pikmin since the
first Pikmin.
[Music]
Or expand another Friends game screen.
You got to get above above that uh
See, like I don't like watching things
with low FPS because it gives me PTSD
from raiding and Burning Crusade.
Wall that to your left. You're almost
there, though.
Past the wall. I have to do a little
wall ride. Okay. Okay. So, everyone can
watch them play. Oh, I think I I think I
know where you are. I think I know where
you are. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. I think
we have to try.
Okay. Oh, nice. Let's take a picture
here. Okay. Are you ready? Smile. Wow.
Picture mode too. I like your pose,
Meeks. On the right Joy Con 2
controller, there's an additional
button. With the C button, you can pull
up a chat menu.
Oh, dang. A really, actually, guys, uh,
I got a call coming right now. So, uh,
I'll be right back. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Here you can quickly and easily mute
yourself and more. And there's this.
I'm actually really surprised they're
letting people get
cameras. I would have not expected
Nintendo to do this because
of Well, you know,
by connecting this camera to the system.
Hey. Yeah. Hey, what's up? Hello.
Yo, dick. So, it automatically green
screens you. Good. How does this work?
You can appear on screen and video chat
while playing a game. See your faces on
here. Wait, dick. How was your test
yesterday? Good. No, no, no. Here's how
it looks with just the camera feed. I
don't know. There you go. I bet you like
that. Can you wait for me? Please look
forward to games which use your camera
feed like this. Oh, that's a good one.
That was good.
No, no, wait. Go left. Go left. Left.
Left. A little more this way. All right.
All right. I'll be fair. This is a cool
feature. If they have it implemented
into these video games and it detects it
automatically and it changes it
dynamically, this is a really cool
feature. It is. I feel like a lot of
people wouldn't use this. Like I feel
like this is something that less than
probably 10% of the people that are
going to buy a console will use. But
it's a cool technology.
[Music]
using game chat. Very niche. Yeah, I
think so, too. Even when you're apart,
you can play games and hang out as if
you were together in the same room. Play
together or compete in online
multiplayer games.
Chat while playing your personal
favorites.
[Music]
Decide your own rules for a retro game
competition. See, retro? What do you
mean retro? or hold a sports competition
growing up
all together anywhere anywhere.
Game chat. It's ridiculous.
Old retro. Yeah. What did you think? In
developing Game Chat, our goal was for
you to enjoy playing online with more
closely, including family and friends,
almost as if you're all playing together
in the same place. That's a cool idea.
The camera you saw in the trailer is the
Nintendo Switch 2
camera, which will be available on the
same day as Switch 2. I guess I could
use that.
A Nintendo Switch online membership will
be required to use Game Chat. Yeah,
that's good. That's That's definitely
good. I mean, I I just I'm actually
really, as I said, I'm surprised
that cuz like this is the way they make
sure that you're 18, right? Cuz like
they have a card on file or something
like that.
However, since we'd like as many people
as possible to experience game
chang I I would. It's like an a it's
like an agegate to where like you don't
have kids getting on the camera and like
doing weird [ __ ]
Be available without a membership for a
limited time.
We hope you'll try it out. I don't know.
I don't know. Additionally, Game Chat
supports the Nintendo Switch parental
controls app and different settings can
be adjusted. For example, whether
parental permission is always required
when a child wants to use Game Chat to
play with their friends. It should
always be on like we'd like to introduce
another new experience. I guarantee you
like if we were kids and we had this and
like you could be on
camera, I gu I would have never done
this because it's just not my kind of
thing. But I guarantee you I would have
had my friends pulling their dick out on
the camera. Like they would have been
doing it and it would have been like I
don't even think it would have been five
minutes really. Like it probably would
have been like oh there's a camera.
Wait, can people see me? Really? Okay.
Boom.
With family and friends.
Yeah. No.
On Nintendo Switch, even if you just
have one game, you can pass a Joy-Con
controller to a friend and play
together. But on Nintendo Switch 2, you
can play together locally on multiple
systems using just one game with Game
Share. As shown here, even games that
require multiple screens can be played
if one person owns a compatible game.
With Game Share, you can temporarily
share compatible games with others who
also have Nintendo Switch, too. That's
really cool. This is a really cool
feature. I like this a lot. This is
badass. Or a Nintendo Switch system. The
DS had this. Yeah, it did. I remember I
had this with um there was this girl in
high school. I bought a Nintendo DS to
play uh Pokemon with her in high school.
And
uh um uh well basically uh yeah so
that's how I know about it. Yeah.
You can share a game with up to three
other systems at a time. Did you read
it? What do you think? Game share also
supports online play with other Switch 2
systems and you can use it with friends
via game chat which we showed earlier.
Game share can only be used with
compatible games. This feature is
planned for several titles, starting
with a free update for Clubhouse Games
51 Worldwide Classics on Nintendo
Switch. I actually think this is
probably the coolest thing they've
announced so far in terms of like what
like how it's like useful for like an
average person. This is really cool.
Game share support is also planned for
select games exclusive to Nintendo
Switch 2. So, we hope you'll look
forward to it. Up next,
that's it.
We'd like to show you the Nintendo
Switch 2 system itself.
It's like the size. Please take a look.
Hold up. I feel like it's like a
phone. Bigger screen, same thickness. At
7.9 in, Switch 2 has a bigger built-in
screen. Here's how that compares to
Nintendo Switch. The systems thickness
remains the same. Okay.
Can you get a longer one? With
approximately double the pixels compared
to Switch, you can enjoy games in
greater detail on the 1080p screen. I
can't [ __ ]
tell. I I can't [ __ ] I can't
tell. I like this number a lot. See,
this is the number that we should be
seeing more often. I really like this
number. We need to get this number a lot
more. I don't know why it hasn't
happened. Thank god.
The screen supports up to 120 frames per
second, allowing for smoother gameplay
in supported titles. Yeah,
great. FPS is better.
The LCD screen is more vivid and
supports HDR, providing more contrast
between light and dark areas of the
images. That looks really nice.
The all-new Joycon 2 controllers connect
magnetically. Strong magnets keep the
controllers firmly attached to the
system. Detach a controller easily by
pressing the release button on the back.
That's a good idea. I like that. That's
cool.
[Music]
The SL and SR buttons are bigger for
greater comfort and control when playing
with a Joy-Con 2 held horizontal. I've
never done this.
The left and right sticks are now
larger.
Wow. Mouse controls. Wait, what? Mouse
controls. Each Joycon 2 controller can
be used as a mouse to play. Okay, that's
[ __ ] cool. That's really cool. With
compatible games, both the left and
right Joycon 2 support mouse controls.
Okay. All right. All right. All right.
By adjusting the audio balance between
the ranges, sounds from the built-in
speakers are clearer and more natural in
handheld and tabletop modes. Mhm.
Built-in mic for easy voice. Yeah, I
already talked about that. It has a
built-in microphone so you can voice
chat with friends anytime via game chat.
It also uses noiseancelling technology
to filter sounds so your voice will come
through clearly.
3D audio gives you a sense of space.
Even if you don't have a surround sound
system, games can be enjoyed with more
immersive three-dimensional sound as if
it were coming from all around you.
[Music]
Wow, that's useful for Elden Ring.
Place your Nintendo Switch 2 however you
like with a large sturdy stand. That's
nice. You can move it freely like this.
Okay. And then if you push down on it,
it breaks.
In addition to the USBC port found on
the bottom of the system, there's one on
top as well. Yeah.
Mhm. It's handy for connecting a USBC
camera. Okay. Or charging in tabletop
mode.
That's cool. I like that. Nintendo
Switch 2 comes with 256 GB of internal
storage, 8 times that of Nintendo Switch
for storing. I I don't know how big
their games are, so it's hard really for
me to have a frame of reference for how
big that actually is. Game downloads,
save data, and more.
Reading and writing data is also faster.
So, I I think I hit the Nintendo Switch
to connect to your TV and enable up to
4K resolution for compatible games. HDR
is also supported in TV mode.
[Music]
That looks really
good. Full ventilation. Okay. So, it's
not going to overheat. The Nintendo
Switch 2 dock has a built-in fan that
keeps your system cool. This helps keep
performance stable.
So, but if that breaks though, you're
going to have a bad time.
On Nintendo Switch 2, you can play
Nintendo Switch 2 games as well as
compatible Nintendo Switch games.
Physical and digital games are
supported.
Cool. Yeah, I feel like backwards
compatibility should just be expected,
honestly.
[Music]
As you just saw, Nintendo Switch 2 isn't
simply an improved Nintendo Switch. It
seems like it is. We redesigned the
system from the ground up and packed in
lots of new gameplay features. To be
fair, okay. All right. I'll be a little
bit more fair. this this feature like
with the mouse for example and a couple
of other things. This actually does look
like a pretty pretty decent good piece
of
hardware. It does like it looks pretty
good. And to help players better
understand the Switch 2 hardware, we're
currently developing this game. Okay,
let's see. Mr. Pawamoto.
Hello.
My current location is actually inside
the game itself. All right, let's see
it. What? This is Nintendo Switch 2
welcome tour. What? Exclusive to
Nintendo Switch 2. What the hell is
this? I'm standing over here. The [ __ ]
Okay, everyone, join me inside the
[Music]
game. There are a lot of question mark
icons here. Yeah, let's examine them.
Where
are the magnets?
The Joycon 2 controllers attach to the
system with magnets and those magnets
are inside the
system. The SL and SR buttons on the
Joycon 2 are made of metal.
So that's how they attach to the system.
Great. Okay. I could have assumed a
magnetic circuit is formed between them
so they won't easily detach. So like
it's like magnets and [ __ ] right?
Through examining signs like these, you
can discover all sorts of secrets about
Nintendo Switch 2. I guess I guess maybe
this is cool.
Example, the Joy-Con 2 controllers have
mouse controls. And when combined with
the gyroscopes, you can even do
something like this. Mhm.
You can adjust the position of the golf
club and aim for the cup by rotating the
Joy-Con, too.
Well, that's cool. By combining the
mouse controls and gyroscopes, things
like this are possible.
There are secrets to discover even as
you're playing mini games and tech
demos.
Some of the secrets range from the
unique features of the system. Yeah. To
tiny details you might not notice until
they're pointed out. So, it's basically
like a program that's a tech demo.
Plenty.
Oh. Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour will
launch as a paid digital game on the
same day as Nintendo Switch 2. So,
please check it out if you're
interested. Okay.
Now, I'd like to share some more
information regarding Nintendo Switch 2.
Okay.
This is the game card for Nintendo
Switch 2 titles. It looks like a game
card. It's the same shape as Nintendo
Switch game cards, but it's now red and
it has much faster data reading speeds.
That makes sense. Usually in a lot of
video games, the red ones are higher
level. Like in Zelda, there's like the
blue knights and the red knights. And
the red knights are stronger.
Yeah. No, this is there's continuity
here.
Red red is the generally accepted color
of fast. Switch 2 will only work with
micro SD Express cards. Yeah, everybody
everybody knows this, right? They're a
different type of SD card and will make
high-speed data transfers possible. Wow.
I remember buying these at like Walmart
that regular micro SD cards used for
Nintendo Switch will not be compatible.
Why not?
Additionally, to transfer data from
Switch to Switch 2, you can log into
your Nintendo account to use the system
transfer feature. With this feature, you
can transfer save data, digital games,
and more. That's cool. Yeah. We're also
releasing a new Pro Controller.
It has a C button which launches game
chat and on the back there are new GL
and GR buttons which you can use to
assign existing button
controls. In addition, an audio jack has
been added. We've introduced a few new
features and after today's presentation,
the official Nintendo Switch 2 website
will go live. There will also be an Ask
the Developer article on the website
where the three of us will talk about
the development of Nintendo Switch 2. We
hope you'll check that out as well.
And now, the Nintendo Switch 2 launch
day
tomorrow. Nintendo Switch. Nintendo
Switch 2 launches on June 5th.
We're very much looking forward to the
day when you all get to experience it.
So, please wait just somewhere around
there.
It's like a week. Yeah. Now,
broadly
speaking, on Nintendo Switch 2, you can
play three types of games. Mario, the
first type is Nintendo Switch 2 Zelda.
These games take advantage of the
performance and features of Switch 2.
Mhm.
The second type is compatible games that
were released on Nintendo Switch. See,
like I've been holding out on playing
Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the
Wild because I was hoping that they
would add in a new Switch that would
give you better FPS because like unless
it's Bloodborne, I'm not playing another
30 [ __ ] FPS game, guys. Like it's not
going to happen. So yeah, it's
happening. No, I I I've been waiting on
this honestly. Like I'm the kind of guy
like if I got to wait for something for
3 years, then I wait, you know, it'll
happen eventually. I'll be right back.
Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games are the
third type.
Some games that were released on Switch
will receive upgraded versions that
offer things like improved visuals,
unique ways to play on Switch 2, and
more. Yeah.
Now, I'd like to show you the Nintendo
Switch 2 edition of Super Mario Party
Jamberee. Okay, let's see it. Please
take a look.
Super Mario Party Jamberee is getting an
upgrade on Nintendo Switch 2. I've never
seen this. The upgrade expands on the
base game and adds new features,
including mouse controls. Wait, mail
audio recognition.
More expressive
rumble gameplay that uses a camera
accessory.
All of which can be accessed a meat spin
game. Let's check out three new and
updated
modes. First up is Mario Party mode.
With a single camera, up to four players
can join the festivities. What? You'll
be able to see each other's faces as you
play, so you can experience all their
reactions and emotions in real time.
Uh-huh. Or four friends can take the
party online. This is cool for
streamers.
Up next, it's Bowser Live. A mode where
the livelier team wins. What? Bowser
will bring you on stage to hit blocks to
collect the most coins.
Guide an RC car with your voice.
Go and compete in other mini games using
full body movement. This is so dumb.
Finally, this would be so good for on
the mouse controlled carnival. This is
great with the safety bar lowered and
secure. Oh boy. You're off.
Yeah. Use mouse controls to shoot down
enemies while you feel the bumps and
rumbles of the coaster.
When you enter a pipe, a miniame will
begin. Okay. There's a bouldering game
where two players each control
I remember when I played
Astrobot. That's
just I remember. Yeah, that's I remember
this. How about that? An arm in one.
Shake a can of spray paint and quickly
tag objects.
Enjoy the thrill.
Mini games. How quickly can you reach
the station?
From mini games that use a camera, the
built-in
microphone, mouse controls, and rumble.
The biggest party yet is getting even
bigger. Super Mario Party Jamberee
Nintendo Switch 2 Edition plus Jamberee
TV launches on Nintendo Switch 2 July
24th.
Yeah, I don't know if Nintendo Switch 2
players maybe for stream content. Super
Mario Party Jamberee can upgrade to
Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. Yeah, I think
this kind of stuff is good for stream
content for sure. Purchasing an upgrade
pack.
Mhm. Please look forward to a new Mario
Party experience where you can see each
other's reactions while playing. Uh-huh.
Let's continue presenting some more
Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games. Let's
see it,
gentlemen.
Nintendo Switch 2 editions of The Legend
of Zelda. I've been waiting for this
since I think this first one came out in
2018. I knew that one day they would
bring out a version that was like above
60fps. Good things come to those who
wait. And the wait is almost
over. How about that?
Of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda:
Tears of the Kingdom. I'm feeling real
good. Feature enhanced resolution and
frame rates. Mhm. and also support HDR
which makes the image more vibrant.
Yeah. So you can play with smoother,
higher graphics.
[Music]
See, been waiting on this for a bit. You
can get even more out of your adventures
in Hyrule using Zelda Notes.
What? Zelda. This new feature can be
accessed via the Nintendo Switch app on
smart devices.
It's a game specific service that's
exclusive to the Switch 2 editions of
these titles. What? For example, it can
help guide you to various locations like
shrines and quorox you haven't found
yet.
So, it's like Google
Maps, but for a video
game, so Zelda gets to run around with a
smartphone.
See, if Ubisoft made a console, you'd
have to pay $10 for this.
Guidance activating. No way. Proceed
north.
No
way. OnStar for a video game. Or you can
share your creations using QR codes and
send them to another player to create in
their game.
Mhm. Okay, that's a really cool
[Music]
idea. This is actually such a cool idea.
I like this a lot.
That's dope. Yeah, it is. I hope these
features will make your adventures even
more enjoyable.
Kirby. Kirby. Kirby and the Forgotten
Land, you'll be able to enjoy an
additional story exclusive to the
Nintendo Switch 2 edition along with
improved graphics and frame rates.
I don't even know what Kirby does
nowadays. This story takes place in the
Forgotten Land after being struck by a
powerful meteor. That's the last Kirby
game I played with on Super Nintendo.
Oh, we hope you're looking forward to
Kirby's new adventure.
You know, this reminds me a lot of
Astrobot.
Metroid Prime 4 Beyond will have both a
Nintendo Switch and a Nintendo Switch 2
edition.
[Music]
We're going to play this on release. In
addition to standard controls, you can
use mouse controls for intuitive
gameplay on Switch. That is really
[ __ ] cool.
That is
awesome. I'm gonna be real. Like that's
badass, too. Okay. Yeah. Plus, you can
explore the immersive world in 4K at 60
frames per second or enjoy smoother
action in full HD at 120 frames per
second. Thank
god for so long. It's like Sony is still
like, "Oh, you can go all the way up to
45
fps. Some of these games can even go up
to 60." It's like,
what? What year is it?
Choose from these two modes, both of
which support HDR, based on your
preference and play. Yeah, we're going
to go in on this game.
Plus, Pokemon Legends is
This game looks like the biggest piece
of [ __ ] that I've seen in the entire uh
event trailer. Like you guys, like
whoever the [ __ ] is working at Pokemon,
they need to just
um you know what they need to do? They
need to take that POW World company and
instead of suing them, just buy them and
say,
"Guys, just can you fix our
shit?" That's all they need to do.
that this is look at the look at this
world, bro. Like, DA, which is scheduled
to launch later this year, bro. Like,
look at this. This is going to come out
later this is the most This is pathetic,
bro. Like, this is the worst thing I
ever seen in my life. Will not only
receive a Nintendo Switch version, but
you know, the only people that like
Pokemon now are girls. Nintendo Switch 2
edition as
well. By taking advantage of the power
of Switch 2, you can enjoy your
adventure in Lumio City with enhanced
resolution and frame rates. You want to
know what's really [ __ ] sad is the
fact that whenever I think about this, I
think this is the Relaxosaurus Lux from
Pow World. I've played Pow World so much
I forgot what the Pokemon
were. Isn't that [ __ ] up?
That's really [ __ ] up.
[Music]
The Nintendo Switch 2 edition games you
just saw will be available as both
physical and digital versions. Wait, I
bought Breath of the Wild when it came
out and I never played it and now I have
to buy it again for Nintendo Switch 2.
Oh god. All right. All right. All right.
And if you already own the Nintendo
Switch version of a game, you can play
the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition by
purchasing an upgrade pack.
We hope you're looking forward to these
Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games. Was it
only $70 and not 80?
Next, I'd like to introduce a brand new
game featuring mouse controls with the
Joycon 2 controllers.
Please take a look. What is
it? What?
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
What is this? DEI Rocket League cuz
they're all disabled.
[Music]
Each mouse moves one of the
wheels. I am memeing by the way. This
looks really
[Music]
cool. April fools. No. No. This is a
cool
idea. True. Yeah. No. No. It It's
I have to play it and find out though,
[Music]
right? That's cool.
[Music]
Damn.
In Dragon Drive, you'll use both Joy-Con
2 controllers as mice to intuitively
pull off various moves. We hope you're
looking forward to a new twist on
threeon-ree matches using dual mouse
controls. I feel like this game is more
of a tech demo of the tech.
Well, it's more of a tech demo of this
new feature rather than a game.
Next, here are some games from our
publishing and development partners
coming to Nintendo Switch 2.
What is it?
I've seen this one. Observed the lands
between.
Oh [ __ ] This world is in dire need of
repair.
All right. You can see them, can't you?
The rays of
grace that guide you through your
burden. The reason why it's called the
Nintendo Switch 2 is it's referencing
how much FPS you get while playing Elden
Ring.
I have no doubt you will become Elder Y.
Play it again. You take the throne.
It's really f It's really sad because
like all the time I think about, oh, I
should play this new game. I should play
this new game. Yeah, but what if I
replayed Elden Ring again, but I used
like this weapon instead? Oh, that would
be so cool.
Tarnished Edition. Oh, that's
accurate. Hey, I'm Greg Cassavin from
Super Giant Games. Here to say that
Hades 2 is coming to Nintendo Switch.
Our first ever sequel introduces the
princess of the dead, an immortal witch
out to vanquish the sinister Titan of
Times. You'll battle beyond the
underworld to the ends of the earth.
Getting to know dozens of characters
from Greek myth in a story that reacts
here every setback and victory. This is
a fun game. I play this game you can
quickly pick up and play whether you're
experienced with the original or not.
Look for more about Hades 2 later this
year.
Mhm. Very good
game. Dragons Dogma.
It's crazy how definitive Street Fighter

Mino, don't they?
Cool. So, it's coming out on Hey, this
is Joseph from Hazel. Oh, it's this guy.
I'm super excited for Split Fiction to
come to Nintendo. I remember the best
part about this guy is
that somebody asked him a question about
the game being DEI and he like he didn't
even know what it
was. He's like, "Wait,
what? What's that? Wait,
what? What are you talking about?" The
Switch 2. The game is story about
friendship. You play as Mio, who writes
sci-fi, and Zoe, who writes fantasy.
Yeah. Together, they get trapped in
their own stories. I need to play this.
You and a friend to help them break
free.
Let me tell you this. If you like It
Takes Two, you're going to love this
one. Trust me. It Takes Two is their
last game. You'll be able to play Split
Fiction on the day Switch 2 launches.
Good for him.

HD Remaster. Set foot in Luxendark as a
warrior of light once more.
I was always going to play that Unicorn
Overlord game, but I never got around to
it. Like after I played Metaphor, I
decided that I like turn-based video
games again. It was actually that
actually wasn't what it was. The gateway
drug was actually Hongai Star
Rail. And I've probably put over a
thousand hours into Hongkey Star Rail.
Now, I've played the game for probably
about three of those hours because the
rest of it was on autoplay, but um I've
I've had the game loading and and and
played for a long time.
Yakuza.
If I start with the Yakuza series,
should I start with this?
Is that who I is? Is that the guy from
Pirate
Yakuza? Holy
[ __ ] Maja.
Yes. Okay, so maybe I should play
it. It's his origin. He's in every game.
I didn't know.
So, this should be where I start.
This the best one. Yeah, we'll have more
games to show from our publishing and
development partners, but for now, we'd
like to show a game being developed in
collaboration with Nintendo. Please take
a look.
KT. Is that a Pokémon? The Zonai who
descended from the
heavens, joined hands with the Hilians
who dwelt on the surface. Their union
led to a great and prosperous kingdom.
This happened in real life. These are
the Nephilim, the fallen angels that
came down and they mated with humans.
This happened. But in time, a terrible
evil arose.
Wait, it's Legend of Zelda. That's
Ganon. Fought to vanquish this evil. One
which future generations would call
Yeah.
the imprisoning war.
Oh, perhaps you truly have traveled back
in time.
[Music]
The energy from this game really reminds
me a lot of metaphor. You know, like
that dragon temple [ __ ]
Yeah, I like this a lot. That's I will
castle.
Then that must mean the pastel.
Damn.
Wait. Dynasty Warriors: Legend of
Zelda.
What? What?
What? That's
awesome. Yeah, we're going to play
this. Oh,
yeah. Hyrule Warriors.
So whatever happened to like the
triforce because that was like the main
plot
device. Now I never see it anymore.
It's still there. Yeah, that was the
that was always the meta, right?
Courage, wisdom, and strength. That was
Hyrule Warriors Age of Imprisonment.
It's being developed by Cochmo games
with support from Nintendo.
We hope you're looking forward to the
untold story of the Imprisoning
War, which took place in Hyrule long
ago.

Controlling the wind using a mysterious
baton. Link set sail on an adventure
across the great sea. The Legend of
Zelda, The Wind
Waker. Transcending history and the
world. A tale of souls and swords
eternally retold. I had this in this 3D
weapons based fighting game. Each
fighter comes equipped with a different
weapon and Link from The Legend of Zelda
series enters the fray.
This was
experience a world of white knuckle.
Whatever happened to F-Zero? Like I I'm
going just give an unpopular opinion. I
think they should stop making Mario Kart
and just replace it with F-Zero. I think
F-Zero is way
cooler. That's just really what I think.
Why not both? That's
fine. Like I I I remember uh my friend
got this game for his
birthday and um I already had the game
and so I played it with him. His name is
Martin and I beat him over and over and
I was lapping him like two or three laps
ahead of him and I was talking [ __ ] He
never played the game again. I think I
ruined his birthday that
year. I I remember this I remember this
game so well.

in the future. So, Fire Emblem, Super
Mario Sunshine, like what other game
would I want to have them add? Uh maybe
like I don't know if they don't have
Super Monkey Ball 2 like there
definitely be that
and Melee. Ooh, Melee. You're right.
That'd be a good one. Where's Sunshine?
It's the beginning. It's right
there. Paper Mario. Luigi's
Mansion. Nintendo Gamecube. Nintendo
Classics. The Switch 2 exclusive game
library coming to Nintendo Switch Online
Plus expansion pack launches the same
day as the hardware's release. Damn. So,
they're coming they're coming right out
with it. And a dedicated controller
designed after the original GameCube

connect wirelessly and also has a C
button to quickly access Game Chat.
Cool. The Nintendo GameCube controller,
exclusively available for Nintendo
Switch Online members, will also be

How many games does a console have to
have to make you want to buy the console
to play that game? Like what's your
average? Like obviously some people
might be like I bought a PS4 display
Bloodborne, right? But like what's the
average for a lot of people it's just
one?
We've shown a lot of games so far. The
next game will be the Am I the only
person that thinks it's a little bit
ironic that people all these people are
saying one game, but the console costs
$450, but everybody's complaining about
a $10 increase in the price of that.
Like I I I don't I don't I mean what do
I know? Right. I mean it just it seems
seems like an interesting double
standard. The last from our publishing
and development partners.
Please take a look. Was worth it? Yeah.
Oh, is this
it? I think this is it.

Sony wouldn't do
it, so they had to switch up on. I give

closer.
Yeah. So, is this coming out on
release 2026? No, it's
not. Available only on Nintendo Switch.
[ __ ] Okay. So, I am in the bottom. What

Damn.
To recap,
Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th.
Finally, here are the hardware options
that will be available at launch. Let's
get it. We'll release Nintendo Switch 2
as well as a bundle that includes a
digital version of Mario Kart
World. That's it.
For more details, please check the
official Nintendo Switch website, which
goes live later today. All right, got
it.
We've covered a lot of information.
That's crazy. But that's all we have to
share for today.
You'll have to wait just a bit longer
for
launch. We are very much looking forward
to everyone being able to experience
Nintendo Switch 2.
We appreciate you joining us today.
Thank you very much.
All right. All right. So, what did I
think of this event? What did I think? I
I would say that this
is I mean like this I don't know what
this curse blood thing is. They're going
to bring out more information about it
in a couple of days, so we're just going
to wait and see. So, like overall, I
would say that my excitement
is like I think that the console has
really interesting and cool tech and
it's probably worth the money if it's
450 bucks and it's portable, etc. Like I
I feel like really that's it's probably
a decent deal. It's like a a good value
for your your money. We'll wait for an
OLED version. Yeah. Yeah. They'll
probably have an OLED or maybe a pro
version that'll come out in a few years
or some other variation of that. A lot
of the games that they announced, uh,
like this this one, I I feel like this
is the one that's also like kind of like
was a sleeper excitement one for me is
it was the mech game. Uh, I I don't know
what this is or what this is going to
be, but this looked kind of cool. But
otherwise, I mean, a lot of the games
I'm glad that they're focusing on FPS
because FPS makes it feel like it's a
lot better to play. So yeah, I mean the
demon machina. Yeah, something like
that, right? It's already on PC. Is it
really? Oh, I didn't even know that.
It's part two. Yeah, I had no idea. I
never even heard of this game. And so
maybe it would be good to play. But
either way, um I'm pretty excit this is
having OnStar in Google Maps for for
Legend of Zelda is just
[ __ ] They should have called this, by
the way. They should have called it
Nav'i. I don't know why they didn't call
it Nav'i. like it. What a massive
[ __ ] mistake not doing that. So yeah,
I mean I'm just being honest,
right? True. Yeah, but uh anyway, bro.
True. Yeah, exactly. And uh cuz it's
like Nav'i Navigator even, right? I mean
it's just like I mean how do you not how
do you not come to that conclusion? But
maybe if Nintendo wants to take that
idea um you know they can have
[Music]
it. [ __ ] Nintendo. Yeah, Na'Vi's
already taken. Yes, buy Nintendo. But
hey, if anybody is going to Nintendo
could sue itself. Of any company that
would sue itself, it would be Nintendo.
So, uh yeah, the the thing with the
mouse, by the way, was really really
cool. Like, I really like the the thing
with the like moving this around with
the mouse and everything. That's
awesome. Especially with like the
Metroid Prime thing. So, yeah. I mean,
the uh the trailers and everything
looked pretty good. I would say that if
I had to rate this, where would I rate
this game, how good would I say the uh
the event was? I'd say it was decent,
right? It wasn't like a crazy insane
event. I think there were like a handful
of games that looked pretty good.
Obviously, the one that I'm probably the
most excited for is going to be the new
From Software game. This looks like some
sort of like Bloodborne Night reign type
thing. But I think that you have a lot
of people that are frustrated about the
quality of um uh the sorry the price of
the games. Uh it's looking like Nintendo
Switch 2 is going to be that benchmark
upgrade from like uh things costing uh
you know like $70 up to 80. So I think
you could definitely have that happen.
And uh yeah, I'll get one eventually.
Yeah, I think so, too. And uh you can
play POE2 and Wild's on it. I don't know
if you can or not. I have no idea. It's
up to 90 for physical. Yeah, if you want
to buy the physical copy, it's $10 more.
And so, yeah. I mean, overall, the
trailers looked pretty decent. I mean,
there's nothing about this that's like
really like it's the same as like the
PS5. I feel like the last game console
that was like really like holy [ __ ] was
either like the PS4, but like even that
was like just kind of a good console.
I'd say it was really the Wii. The Wii
was the last console. Actually, the
Switch uh Yeah. You know what? The
Switch one was really good. Like this
just seems like another version of the
the same thing. And the Switch one like
really it's the Switch 2. Like this is
the Switch 3 because we had the Switch
one was the Wii U, right? But that was
like kind of like their test and now
they're uh they're fully committing to
like the console
thing. I mean the portable console
thing. So
yeah, you're saying 70 to 80, but
Nintendo has been uh $59.99 this whole
time. Yeah. So anyway, if you go and you
look at the uh the prices of the games,
uh you can see like right here, where
does it say? Uh Mario uh this is Mario
Kart. Um where is it? This is a pretty
crazy website. Okay. Uh where where does
it say? Holy [ __ ] Um
uh yeah, there you go. $7
$79 and so the last Zelda was 70. Well,
I'm just saying like it literally I just
want to show you like this is on the
Nintendo website and it says $80 on it,
right? So, yeah. There you go. Free
realm. You've been waiting uh two
console generations to play Breath of
the Wild.
Yeah. I don't want to play the I I don't
want to play the game on a shitty on a
shitty system. Yeah. I mean, absolutely.
Like, I I care about playability a lot.
I mean, that's what really matters a lot
to me. So absolutely that's what I would
do. Yeah, 100%. That's with day one DLC.
I didn't even know it had DLC on it.
Yeah, I I guess maybe it does. But um
anyway, yeah. So I mean I would say
like I can definitely see like where
there's a lot of frustration from
players where it's like, okay, well now
you're making the system cost more money
and like that's too much for me, etc.
But overall, I mean, I would say that
like from what I've seen so far, uh,
actually looks pretty decent. And, uh,
I'll be looking forward to the console.
That's what I would say. Yeah, decent
enough, man. You can emulate it on PC
for higher FPS. Yeah, but I don't want
to do that. Nintendo also never puts
their games on sale, maybe. Uh, what's
an upgrade package cost? Probably like
20 or 30 bucks. That's what I'd assume,
right? But, uh, yeah. How much does the
console supposed to be supposed to cost?
The console at a baseline is $450.
And I read that in Japan uh you have
like regional pricing and price locking
and it's actually only
$350 but uh what's being sold to the
west is uh for $450 and it's like 500 if
you get Mario Kart with it. Do you think
tariffs will affect that? I have no
idea. I mean I don't think anybody does.
I mean the state of tariffs change it
seems like every day sometimes multiple
times a day. So, it's really hard to
