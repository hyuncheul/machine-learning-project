this is so
normal it's it's so
normal to wake up for the Nintendo
Direct at like
7:45
a.m. so that I can watch this normal
Nintendo
presentation as a grown ass
man so normal uh listen chat welcome to
the Nintendo switch 2
direct I'm live a little early 40 whole
minutes early I don't even know how this
happened I'll tell you what
happened I got to bed last night
probably around 2:00
a.m. and then my biological
clock I usually like 7 to 8 hours of
sleep it was like no no you got to wake
up early so you're going to you're going
to be up at like
7:45 actually no earlier like
7:30 cuz I couldn't get back to
sleep so just to show you what kind of
Nintendo adult I
am I had this thought well two thoughts
one one of the things that I thought
while I was trying to get back to sleep
it was
um this guy fucks windows I don't know
what that was that just came into my
head it was weird uh and then the second
thought was well as an
adult I don't really get excited about
Christmas
anymore I don't get excited about
birthdays because you
know at this
point I'm
good um so yeah holidays don't really do
it for Me Maybe I like food holidays
stuff like that stuff where I'm going to
like see friends family sure but
but as I mentioned last night
Nintendo has been holding
off
information they have released the most
scant amount of information aside from
potential leaks about the switch 2 and
um here it is for an
hour we got some time to
go we're joyless consumers yeah
seriously uh we got plenty of time to go
we've got in fact 40 minutes of just
talking of me playing Mario
64 you know it's going to be it's going
to be
great
yeah so we'll do that uh but I I'm
actually excited about this because um I
want to have tempered expectations and I
kind of had those for the switch one
direct last week which had you know
Metroid Prime 4 which was a weird
trailer but I kind of liked it um
tomadachi
and you know just some other re-releases
and stuff
so that was like definitely uh one of
those things where and I I say it too
don't get too excited that way you can
enjoy whatever is presented and you're
not
disappointed chat I don't even know what
I'm expecting but my brain was like
you're not going back to sleep you're
way too excited about the Nintendo
Direct what the fuck is
happening I am a Nintendo adult
but you know to be fair there's not a
whole lot of other shit that's coming
out this year that I'm like overly
excited about there's a couple things um
this is pretty much going to
determine my gaming for the year I would
say um
my my main okay I I've done
predictions like crazy already so I'm
not going to do too much of them I'll
just say this a new 3D Mario would be
nice we're going to see a ton of Mario
Kart we're going to learn about the C
button we're going to learn about the
switch being a
mouse the you know joyc
con we'll learn some more Hardware stuff
um maybe they'll detail their online
stuff my outlandish hopes are Metroid
Prime
4 will have an enhanced version for the
switch
2 my other outlandish hope is that's
that's kind of more reasonable um I'm
hoping for you know Final Fantasy 9
remake why not Square just posted a
bunch of stuff about it not a remake but
Final Fantasy 9
sure um and I would like uh Kris
Uprising remake or new
kis maybe Sakurai had something to do
with it that'll be nice
um someone said delusional hopes are
Wind Waker and Twilight Princess HD
ports listen I I've
definitely talked about how much I would
enjoy
those the problem is
this they're stuck on the Wii
U so having them be on you know switch
one and two like in some form would be
would be great because they are great
games um I think the Twilight Princess
Port is a little more faithful than the
Wind Waker one and the Wind Waker one
has a lot of really good quality of life
stuff like the fast sale but it also you
know the visuals are kind of blown out
and bloomy so I'm wondering if they
could like dial that down a little bit
but it still has some really great charm
to it like I I love those two um
remasters but you know I I joked there
should be a Triforce collection which is
Skyward Sword Wind Waker and Twilight
Princess all for the price of $60 not
going to happen
my other prediction is I think we'll see
something Zelda whether it be um you
know Chris Pratt cast's link or
um you know Paul Mescal as link
McCartney or you know maybe we'll see a
something a Lego set a Zelda Lego I
don't know something Zelda is going to
happen at least saying hey we got Zelda
2 because that's a big one for Nintendo
and uh I think it's a little early for
Animal Crossing and I don't think we're
going to
see another outlandish prediction is a
smash ultimate Port that's not
outlandish is it but I do think
something
smash they built this giant game with
this insane
groundwork and I don't think they're
topping that anytime soon I think the
next smash is going to be a
reboot
so I feel like a smash ultimate ultimate
With
Waluigi would be a huge would be a huge
thing so anyway those are some
predictions let's take a look at the
bingo from
azarin uh thank you lizen we got Star
Fox CGI trailer with no gameplay that
sounds pretty yeah um free nextg
upgrades how about paid nextg
upgrades menu music sure that would be
cool exercising game not
yet $59.99 sure five Fire Emblem uh
maybe 3D Mario I'm going to say
definitely something Xbox um we're going
to see a lot of third party developers
we're going to
see maybe um Doom which is Bethesda
which you know Microsoft so
maybe um new Nintendo gimmick that's
going to be the mouse and the C
button um UI
showcase uh listen we had eight years of
Nintendo switch with
no UI upgrades other than like a dark
mode so yeah sure
but outlandish but that would be nice um
I don't know what's going on here
Kirby
sure I don't know if today but yeah
always Kirby Mario Paint 2 would make
sense with the joycon mouse weirdly
and if they did that oh my could you
imagine the trailer it would be a fly
swatter and it would be 3D it would just
be like a a 3D Ultra detailed fly and
like the the swatter is like like a
Smash Brothers kind of thing like it's
just like imposing and then you
hear Mario Paint
2 Red Dead 2 no not yet maybe maybe one
day I think it's powerful enough for Red
Dead 2 I would hope came out long enough
ago uh Call of Duty probably yeah Ian
Maybe not today but Prime 4 we will
maybe see if if my other prediction is
correct that would be cool Elden ring
and DLC new party
game that feels pretty likely or like
something to showcase the features kind
of like a a Nintendo Land
I'm going to say
399 uh maybe
microphone no
yes probably Pokemon
sure so we've got some time uh we got we
got a half hour I'm here real
early the water buffalo is a reference
to the fact that pre- switch to
announcement the community started going
insane and started to talk about water
buffalos
okay car to explain or is discuss how
they'll adapt it to Nintendo labo well
as we all know labo was a runaway
success and people on their Nintendo
switch can't stop playing with
cardboard they love it um it it took the
World by storm cardboard gaming is the
biggest Trend right now everybody's got
cardboard happening
so they have to adapt it you know that
that VR that Nintendo was pushing
chat it was like they were pushing rope
let me tell
you so yeah I'm up if you're wondering
why I'm up so early
um I'm going to play I'm going to play a
video game I'm going to play more of
that Mario thing from last night
uh but I just I set an
alarm and uh my my brain was like no you
didn't you're going to wake up an hour
earlier than your alarm so instead of
fight
it I just said fuck
it and uh you know I have coffee I
bought my half and half I bought um I I
listen I have a shitty like curig
mini and uh I don't use it too
frequently it's like coffee in case of
emergency but for some reason this
machine it doesn't make it easy to clean
like there's no removable Parts I've
tried so I might have to buy a new one
but I was like I need to figure out how
to make a decent cup of coffee so um I
did the best I could and then I just
used a little less water and uh chat I
bought Ronald McDonald's
Homebrew that's what they had at the
store that that was the one that I
thought I've had before wasn't wasn't
terrible and you know what it's not
bad it's still not the most flavorful
coffee but it's
okay Vinnie do you expect obl remake to
be announced here um no not
really that would be
interesting definitely Final Fantasy 9
remake but no not not the other
one all right well
anyway we've got a Nintendo Direct to
worry about and and I don't have to do
very much other than say wow and look at
something and say that's
fine play some unrelated Final Fantasy 9
music uh yeah squaresoft doesn't like
when I play Final Fantasy 9 music I'm
going to save it for for
later trickshot
simulator yeah
also if you want to do
Bingo there is bingo is available
um what's the link hang on let me let me
get the link see again this is 8:30
brain so let me see it's not even 8:30
anymore but I'm good I'm ready to
go hang on let me let me get if you want
to play Bingo you can get your own bingo
ER rt. gdn bingo with a capital
B I don't know if you heard the news but
Nintendo's doing a direct tomorrow and
Friday what are you talking about do not
tell me
that oh they're doing Treehouse okay
gotcha that I don't have to be up early
for hey everyone welcome to the Nintendo
Treehouse starting at 4:30 a.m.
M so yeah with Mario Kart 9 when you
press the button the carts go forward we
also have a cool new item called the
lightning bolt in this game and when you
press it you just get
electrocuted Treehouse has switched to
gameplay well I would assume so I would
hope
so they're going to do like a Nintendo
3DS
presentation um
yeah yeah this is this is my bingo I
already talked about it earlier um it's
funny because I've been doing
predictions for like several days in a
row and even when they announced it I'll
say this the two months went by
fast so here we are it's spring spring
has sprung and uh we're going to get our
Nintendo switch 2 in June of course at
the low low cost of $399
us which um adjusted for inflation is
$599 here's this giant enemy crab this
is um it's weird because the switch was
kept very low like the the $250 price
range I'll say this the switch not
getting a pro
model I don't know if that was Co
related but I was convinced at a certain
point I was like there's no
way like my switch started bending
because of the time I used it
and I figured maybe a new one would
happen I mean sure there was the OLED
and then there was like a fake upgrade
that just had better battery
[Music]
life but yes bending chat a switch can
bend it can literally
Bend let's see switch
[Music]
bending I don't know if this is
edited probably not mine mine isn't
quite like that but when I was using it
like a lot I just I felt like it was
probably heating up and bending I it
still
works fitting it in the dock is a little
bit of a different story but um here's a
here's a great
thumbnail amazing YouTube thumbnailed
that so yeah I mean the switches is kind
of a weird case because we didn't end up
getting a pro model we didn't end up
getting like
customizable UI or themes it was a very
barebones there's never any like price
drops if Nintendo wants to beat the
PS2 they should announce a switch One
price drop to 150 bucks they would lose
money but they would have a dumb title
and then Sony would automatically find
another three million sales oh oh we
found three million PlayStation 2s in
saddam's basement sorry everybody no our
total is actually such and
such but yeah for a system like the
switch um at some point I'm going to do
a full postmortem just for fun and I've
already talked about my favorite games
on the switch one I do think it was uh
all of Nintendo's questionable choices
aside I do think it was a good system
overall I think most of the first party
titles were really good and if
not like
amazing they were like getting back on
track you know what I mean like maybe
some of the ones that weren't so great I
feel like the switch had at least good
entries Mario Party comes to
mind so it was is a pretty good system
and uh I'm you know I'm ready for a new
one uh but it's not just the hardware
chat this is not an example of we're at
a point now where our computers our
phones can do amazing visuals and there
are systems out there that can like pump
but for the switch 2 it's just going to
be like a little bit more power under
the hood and it's going to be Nintendo
games and that's fine but it's never
going to be you know the The Cutting
Edge of most Cutting Edge so I expect to
see dlss revealed
today
um but yeah here we go we've got one
minute
crazy hello everyone welcome to the
switch 2 presentation
we know it's early and we know a lot of
you are at work but we hope this will
satisfy all of your
desires that's why nintend dogs will be

controllers connect
magnetically strong magnets keep the
controllers firmly attached to the
system detach your controller easily by
pressing the release button on the back

is the SL and Sr buttons are bigger for
greater comfort and control when playing

gameplay
features and to help players better
understand the switch to Hardware we're
currently developing this

game what is what
there are a lot of question mark icons
here let's examine them does it just
explain this sign reads where are
magnets holy shit it's insane clown POS
game controllers attach to the system
with magnets and those magnets are
inside the
system that's fucking okay and Sr
buttons on the joycon 2 are made of
metal so that's how they attach to the
system a magnetic circuit is formed
between them so they won't easily detach
that's a fun game no Nintendo land or wi
Sports examining signs like these you
can discover all sorts of secrets about
Nintendo switch 2 another example the
joycon 2 controllers have Mouse controls
and when combined with the gyroscopes
you can even do something like
this you can adjust the position of the
golf club and aim for the Cup by
rotating the joycon
2o okay that's that's fine I guess
combining the mouse controls and iscopes
things like this are
possible there are secrets to discover

types of games

games okay these games take advantage of
the performance and features of switch
2 three games the second type is
compatible games that were released on
Nintendo

type some games that were released on
switch will receive upgraded versions
that offer things like visuals unique
ways to play on switch 2 and more
confirmed they did it I'd like to show

the Nintendo shit the first party shit
that's that's like kind of
light
[Music]
Mario that that's totally
[Music]
Mario I just wonder if it's going to be
Odyssey

subtitle those Diddy Kongs
[Music]
Donkey
[Music]
Kong what the fuck I what is going
on is this my fault because I played
Donkey Kong 64

actually a Mario game with playable
Donkey Kong
[Music]
okay
that's oh okay it's Minecraft Donkey
Kong Street what's going
on you just punch through the entire
fucking
world who's developing this I this has
got to be in-house
[Music]
oh with 2D segments maybe retro had
something to do with this
too I am shocked we didn't get a 3D
Mario reveal I was
convinced
banana wow
[Music]
Donkey Kong
[Applause]
Bonanza okay it's not quite launched
action I mean it's cool looking
mechanics as a monkey I yearned for the
minds
nintend
Swit wellow let see how much they got a
price I mean this is the UK version cuz
the US one shit
[Music]
itself okay uh well we got a couple
things to talk about we didn't get like
there are details that were not given
um I I know there's going to be
Treehouse
presentations
so you know no price equals free oh yeah
that's
true okay let's start with
Bingo I'm going to assume this was
probably something that happened I don't
remember well Kirby
yeah uh um we don't know weirdly that
didn't happen gimmick is the mouse uh
not really UI no kidis Kirby very much
so Prime 4 Elden ring
one new party game not really that's
that's kind of iffy because it's just
jamere with new additions but it the
game is
very part it's there's some party
Centric stuff they showed
the museum the wheelchair game that's
what you call is that what people are
calling it now the wheelchair
game oh
man I'm going to say yeah we didn't get
a
bingo all right that's what it is you're
right it is that that's definitely it um
I yeah check out the gungon 2 trailer
let me get a link to
that the onetime silk song isn't here
yeah
seriously let's see if we got enter the
gungeon
the let's take a quick look
this is actually really
[Music]
exciting wow that is some
crusty crusty
stuff so it's 3D
it's like Risk of Rain one to
[Music]
two all right I mean I'm I'm very
interested I love to enter the gungeon
that that a huge one for me so um we'll
see if the 3D adds to the game play just
going to give it some time we'll see I
don't know the pixel art is kind of hard
to top in my opinion because it just
looks so fucking good that's like going
from Binding of Isaac where it is to
just adding 3D it's like is that going
to add a ton I don't
know uh Fire Emblem is in the GameCube
library for switch 2 that's
iffy listen I have a couple thoughts
there's a good chunk of that direct that
was funny to me for the wrong reasons
which is to say they showed a lot of
stuff with the
camera um they showed
the microphone they were like wow that c
button is so crazy you can talk to your
friends like it was
2013 so that didn't really do anything
for me um the the mouse does look
cool I think overall using a mouse is
the future I guess uh you can use a
mouse with prime I'm curious to see what
that's going to be like I don't know how
I feel about the mouse overall because
again when I'm playing console games
I am sitting on a couch with nothing in
front of me usually and I'm not leaning
forward so you'd have to like kind of
maybe get like a little stand that you
could put the mouse on which is not a
big deal but um you know it's something
to consider so that's typically not my
preferred gaming when I'm actually
sitting on a couch playing a console
game uh it seems like it would be
different if you're using the stand on
the switch and you just have it on a
table sure at that point why not uh the
mouse does open up some interesting
opportunities remember when like
Starcraft got ported to the Nintendo 64
and everyone was like how is that going
to work with a controller and it kind of
did
well now you can do that except the RTS
genre is kind of like I don't know 2 and
1/2 ft in the grave so I don't
know
um Mario Kart looks
great they are banking hard on Mario
Kart and I think there's is a really
good reason for that chat now it's been
over 10 years since Mario Kart 8 first
came out Mario Kart 8 sales here here's
the reason here's the big reason why
they're banking so hard on Mario Kart
and pushing it so hard is the first
trailer as a bundle a packing game and
as a launch game here's here's why very
simple reason 75.8 one million units
so
yeah Vinnie the screen is too
bright um how much is the switch to
switch to is going to be 450 you have
that information can you spawn wave
confirmed 450
bundle is
500
jeez from soft game dusk Bloods is a
multiplayer
game um if I can get a link to that
Source I can we can talk about
it pre-order start on the eighth
is that a day one purchase for you it is
and I'll tell you why one you know how I
am about my stupid Mario
Karts and my Nintendo games I'm going to
eventually get it two I
stream people like watching me stream
Nintendo stuff I'm going to be
completely real with you even if I
wasn't streaming I've gotten every
Nintendo console day one so yeah even if
it's 450 I have you know I have a
Nintendo emergency fund I saved up in my
piggy
bank uh yeah uh but that's um people are
linking some
[Music]
stuff and uh it says here dusk Bloods is
multiplayer uh nintend deal.com
switch2 here's where there seems to be
some kind of confirmation
I want to wait a little bit before like
I kind of want to see it
from um where is this what what is this
photo
from Nintendo
UK is that accounting for
tariffs businesswire.com
it arrives at a suggested retail price
of
$449 that's a little steep I mean
even even if it was just 3.99 that would
be I feel like people would be like okay
that's a little steep but kind of
understandable this is going to end up
being um a talking point I I you know
from what we saw here
today would I say it's worth the 450 I
don't know um for me it's kind of about
the game games the power of the hardware
is fine but I have a steam deck and I
have an Asus so I'm good when I can play
games on that
shit all right it's nice that Metroid
Prime 4 is going to run at 120 FPS if I
wanted to that's cool that doesn't make
the game better like 60 FPS switch
one yeah it's going to be a little
blurrier I'm definitely excited about
the switch 2 version of Prime 4 don't
get me wrong like that's going to be the
way I play it
100% um it would have been nice if it
was designed specifically for the switch
2 but knowing there is a version is
cool is that worth 450 I don't know is a
new Mario Kart worth
450 um I don't know maybe I think
knowing Nintendo and how they are with
price
drops the switch one already started at
a competitive rate because that was
struggle Nintendo and also it was seven
eight years ago but struggle Nintendo
came off of their biggest failure since
the virtual boy and they wanted to be as
competitive as possible and it worked
now we have success
Nintendo and they know they
can they can gouge a little if they need
to they know they don't have to sell
this console at a loss if they don't
want to I think it's probably smart
they're launching with a game like Mario
Kart but yeah and I don't know the the
factors of like the political
ramifications of the degeneration of the
cessation of I don't know if any of that
is affecting the
price but I do know that
um yeah I mean if there is something
related to that when it comes to like
tariffs or
whatever I mean it's just who knows
we'll have to find out that's probably a
little too soon to tell but 450 is a
little steep I think 400 would have made
a little bit more sense for what I saw
today the mouse is not something that is
selling me on that's like you know like
the Wii U having the hold the screen up
to the screen gimmick that was like okay
that's interesting it was used poorly in
Star Fox and then well in like a couple
things the mouse we've all used one it's
practical I mean I get it it's fine
um but I think the main thing for the
switch 2 is instead of gimmicks it's
just a better switch and it looks like
it does that
they didn't reveal a lot of price
related stuff in that direct smartly um
but you know that's a big business move
and for example uh upgrading Mario Party
jamere to its enhanced DLC for switch 2
how much is that that kind of matters to
people you know especially these days
where money is tight and people are
actually like there are um big chain
stores is big like box stores
complaining about
business and like more luxury stores
saying people don't have the money
they're not
shopping money's fucking
tight and I get like they're offering
DLC stuff that looks you know like it's
a decent chunk of additional content
but you know you're going to do $450 for
the console plus you want you know
another $50 for Mario Kart $60 if you
don't buy the bundle
um they're even they're selling the the
the beta uh the sorry the the what is it
called the museum thing they're like
they're not just giving that for free so
yeah I mean I'm listen yes I'm going to
buy a day one yes I like Mario
Kart yes the Donkey Kong game looks
pretty fucking awesome uh we'll talk
about that in a
minute but if I had to be as realistic
as possible yeah the prices are a little
bit you know that's a little bit much so
I think it's going to see we'll see
we'll see if this thing ends up being as
big of a success as switch one I don't
think it will I think it's going to do
just fine I think people want a new
Switch uh we've been you know the listen
it can run cyberpunk we'll see how well
it runs it looks like it's fine um elen
ring ran a little
crusti we'll have to see that was just a
trailer uh they got fin Fantasy 7 remake
so it's you know as powerful at least as
the PS 5 I think the base model
probably but um we'll have to see maybe
it's like somewhere in between a PS4 and
a 5 I don't know they're not revealing
you know it's not like remember uh 32
bits oh yeah well Nintendo's got 64
bits you know the hardware specs are not
as important as uh to the average
consumer as they used to be I feel like
these days we're hitting that wall of
like they showed Mario Party
jamere and Visually it looked just about
the same as Mario Kart
9 um so you know it's like we're at that
point where some enhancements in terms
of resolution and frame rates and maybe
HDR that's nice but yeah otherwise not
so much um another kind of
disappointment is
this no Leed
screen steam decks are actually kind of
cheap compared to how they used to be
and you know you're you're going to get
a really good portable system it doesn't
do
everything it doesn't do everything that
the switch 2 can do but I'm just saying
if Nintendo is going to charge that
price they have to be aware of the
market it's changed there are more
options now there's the um Asus there's
I think there's a steam deck and then
there's there's even like other ones too
like where people are making their own
handheld computers basically
so
anyway it seems more
powerful than a steam deck and the steam
deck is 400
LCD oh okay all right fair
enough $80 games
confirmed are you
serious you got a link to that too steam
deck OLED is closer to 600 fair enough
fair
enough that seems like
bullshit $80 games let's
see okay I'm not getting that info I
think someone's probably just like one
guying
[Music]
am I going to go to the play test for
the switch I don't know I don't think
so I would but I just you
know I yes it's actually $300 games
chat
um I don't know I'm looking at all these
links chats posting for game prices and
I don't
see I do not see
$80 or 90 for
physical price here
Vinnie scrolled
down I'm
scrolling o oh God yeah I don't like
that did they just bypass the $ 69.99
yeah that's going to be that's going to
be very fucking annoying for a lot of
people actual price may vary
manufacturers suggested retail
price that seems fake that is on the
nintendo.com
that is on Nintendo
that's CAD that's our usual Canadian
price maybe it's from a Canadian
retailer um well $500 for switch bundle
with Mario Kart right okay well listen
we could talk about
price um
forever and apparently it's Nintendo us
that that that link was so um yeah if
they're charging an extra $20 for game
on this
system I don't know that's that's not
that's not
good Mario Kart World is $67 in the UK
67 pounds in the UK do the exchange
rate
67 to us doll
dues yeah it's about 80
bucks games are 79 now not 60 anymore I
don't know a lot of games are still $60
as far as I'm
concerned I don't know where that comes
from you know listen I do like I love
Nintendo games I like their Hardware
generally but I don't know what to tell
you when it comes to the price I think
the price
sucks I don't like that that's a
dangerous precedent chat you could tell
the the voice I had a motion in my voice
just then that's a dangerous precedent
that's just a voice crack
but we'll see where this goes I mean
we'll see if this ends up being as big
of a seller for them and
uh you know the cycle happens and Sony
the problem is Sony is also in
belligerent mode as well um in in a
number of ways so I don't know if this
is going to bode well for the industry
if the industry standard ends up coming
up to
um you know 80 bucks GTA 6 people are
saying is going to be 100 well we'll
have to
see
um DK Bonanza says $70 okay let's just
wait and see what happens for all of
this stuff but um here instead of
continuing to harp on prices I know
that's important you know my opinion on
the price I think it sucks it's a
dangerous precedent okay let me just
finish my thoughts on this
thing the new um from soft game looks
cool I saw people saying you know fuck
Nintendo for it being an
exclusive I get you uh you know Sony has
bloodborne exclusively that shit is
stuck on the PS3 or PS4 rather and has
been for a
while I would prefer if all games were
multiplatform that would be
great so I'm not into um the exclusive
bullshit I'm I'm done with that at my
current age I throw throw Mario on the
fucking Steam and I will play it on the
steam really like I don't care uh I just
want to play games and I want to play
them in the best possible place I don't
care Nintendo would still make a killing
if they release their games like Metroid
Prime 4 on Steam
so you know I just I'm not into the
exclusive shit um I'm done with it when
it comes to the game though yeah looks
good that's why I'm saying like it's
like I think it's cool that fromsoft is
willing to try out new shit do new
franchises um but it looked very
bloodborne they even referenced blood in
the beginning of it so I kind of feel
like this is their attempt to um do
something in that vein pardon the pun
and whatever's going on with bloodborne
they're just doing this so cool that
looks good Donkey Kong it's a new take I
still don't know who's developing it I
don't know if they revealed that but
kind of looked like a combo of retro and
Nintendo but
um I thought it looked good I was
actually surprised uh it's weird the
game playay is just rip shit up from the
ground
and uh use it to break the shit out of
other things so that kind of for me is a
is a good use of the extra
power and it also you know people love
mining I don't know I don't know what
happened what is in at the human soul
the human blood that we like to mine
that mining related things end up
becoming we yearn even for the minds so
yeah it's kind of crazy um I hope Diddy
Kong is in the game I don't I don't know
if I love DK's redesign yet there's
something about classic DK I just I just
really enjoy like the rare version um I
don't dislike the redesign which is
closer probably even to DK Junior an
original Donkey Kong so we'll see I mean
it might pay off and I thought the game
looked
cool very surprised there was no 3D
Mario I was
convinced Nintendo is pushing Donkey
Kong kind of hard lately which is just
kind of interesting and all right cool
with that but yeah Mario um had a hugely
successful movie so we're getting Mario
Kart that's pretty big uh but yeah it's
kind of weird that Mario Odyssey still
doesn't have a proper
followup the new DK game is 70 bucks
might be variable pricing per
game I mean yeah it's like like you know
again a lot of Nintendo games are like
60 59.99 so um it's still an increase
you know if it's funny because if you
go too far and then you pull it back a
little bit you're still increasing the
price so but anyway um Kirby air ride I
don't really
understand
why don't get me wrong I love Kirby air
ride I'm going to play the shit out that
game I hope it has a new city mode but
uh just a complete shock not only that
but Sakurai is
back and uh the GameCube service is cool
I was you know we were waiting for that
for a while uh it's enhanced resolution
not like we haven't played games with
enhanced resolution obviously uh but
yeah having that just as part of the
online service getting f-zero with
online multiplayer
I'll take
it and uh what
else I'm not going to you know aside
from maybe checking out the upgrade
unless it's like an extra 20
bucks uh the breath of the wild and
tears of the Kingdom stuff while cool
wouldn't be enough for me to jump back
in it would just kind of be nice to look
at for a little
bit but it's it's nice it exists
don't forget cart sizes too if the game
uses a larger cart size it might cost
more money I don't know how that works
100% but I do know it looks like they're
the about the same size if you're
talking about like the space I don't
know if you're paying by the
gigabyte I don't really know carts seem
to be about about the same size so I
don't know
upgrades are free for Nintendo online
expansion pack members just confirmed on
the
website interesting
okay um new standard on the card
reader someone said there was a a Zelda
Deep
dive what is it does that mean let me
check out Nintendo's YouTube channel
they really bungled that stream by the
way there's a new article about game key
cards without the game on
cart I'm just curious about this so this
video was uploaded to the Nintendo
YouTube
channel upgrade your adventures in
Hyrule on the Nintendo switch 2 system
so we saw a bunch of this The Legend of
Zelda which makes the image more vibrant
and they have smoother higher definition
Graphics Plus
the low times when warping are much
faster helping you explore Hyrule with
ease that's actually pretty
cool they didn't show that in the direct
but
that's it's a nice own the Nintendo
switch games your save data can be
carried over oh
okay not like I need to do anything more
in those games save data files so feel
free to start a new game without
worrying about losing your old data
oh it took that long introducing Zelda
notes a new feature that can
helping GPS is actually like what do you
mean sometimes it can be tough to locate
shrines you haven't cleared or coro's
hiding around
Hyrule that's where navigation comes in
handy so it just tells you where they
are guys
activating proceed
North it'll provide a helpful voiced
guide your destination is north of here
and close your destination is
above going to play Zelda is nearby with
with a fucking GPS so guidance
deactivating give it a try as you search
for all sorts of things
[Music]
when you visit certain places you can
hear voice
memories my study I found a silent
princess in a corner of this desolate
room how many years these are stories
that weren in the original games voice
memories can be located using navigation
your destination is
nearby the dueling Peaks yeah I shudder
to think of what would have happened if
link hadn't LED everyone here still you
know Legend of Zelda tear of the Kingdom
you won't just hear stories from
Princess Zelda this Al the most holy
place in the temple you can look forward
to hearing stories from two other
characters as well is this the
[Music]
afterlife all right we Auto build
sharing another thing item sharing you
can make your own fucked up items share
them if you want watch this whole thing
feel free I'm not I'm good earn inapp
medals based on your
records aim for new medals and goals
like total distance traveled or rupees
collected
[Music]
okay you can also see your gameplay
Trends wow man it just went full
internet once per day you can spin for a
daily bonus you'll be granted whichever
in-game effect it lands on for the day
the Nintendo app is crazy it's got
gambling it's got GPS
navigation there there's dieses
now once per
[Music]
day I mean you know for me it's it's
more the visuals rule on Nintendo switch
[Music]
2 jump back into the adventure now with
enhanced resolution and frame
[Music]
rates yeah yeah that's that's cool
that's fine
um let's see if there's anything else on
their Channel right
now uh
Kirby we saw that Donkey Kong dusk
Bloods that's I mean it's weird because
that's what they're do the wheelchair
game that's just people what are going
to call they're going to call it
Wheels uh so yeah I mean I'm looking at
the page now and it's it's okay here's
what they're pushing aside from the
Nintendo Direct obviously there's a
partner Sizzle reel and all that but
they're pushing Donkey
Kong Mario
Kart as the new games not even Metroid
Prime by the way but Donkey Kong and
Mario
Kart and then the enhanced editions of
Mario Party jambur and
Zelda
Kirby um forgotten land the CG trailer
of Kirby Air Riders and then DUS Bloods
so it's not
like there's a lot they announced for
the Nintendo Direct like there's there
was a ton of like random third party
shit of course and obviously there's
like old games and GameCube but in terms
of um actual first party stuff a little
less than I expected I don't know what I
was expecting actually but kind of just
um just a couple
things so yeah uh I don't know um
I wouldn't say it I wouldn't say it
wasn't worth getting up early over but
it wasn't worth me losing a little
sleepover and and waking up at like 7:45
and not being able to get back to bed
for
sure don't get it day one I understand
that chat member thank you I would
recommend you worry about what you're
buying and I as someone who is pretty
well known as a Nintendo focused
streamer will be able to do my job and
enjoy the games I want to
enjoy and that's fine you can make your
choices as
[Music]
well I'm I as a child I yearned for the
Nintendo
mines um but yes yes obviously I'm a
Nintendo fan I want to play Mario Kart I
think people are going to be expecting
me to play these games and I would want
to play them especially the Donkey Kong
game but um
I'm not going to say I'm 100% pleased
with um the prices I'm not going to say
this voice chat stuff is the coolest
thing ever it's like okay it's a webcam
and a and a crusty microphone
um yeah I mean some of the stuff was
just a little baffling uh but I'm I'm
glad that the um upgrades for the old
games are
free with the expansion pack so it's not
free but it's I'm I'm doing that anyway
so I'm excited to play soulcaliber
online um and Metroid Prime 4 is
obviously it's great that I can now get
that out of my mind as a switch one game
as far as I'm concerned it's just a
switch two game so that makes me a
little more
excited so uh I don't know is is there
anything else you want me to talk about
chat um like I said it was good it
wasn't the best thing I've ever seen as
a reveal it was just kind of bog
standard up grades and some little
features and some improvements and I'm
fine with that price
sucks um but yeah Delta
Rune I have nothing to say about that
Silk song I'm not as you know crazy
about um I'm excited but yeah I mean
it's it's not something I'm losing like
sleepover here's the
UI wow it's the exact fucking
same the pay Astros playroom
ripoff if that's anything more than 10
bucks I can't see people wanting to buy
that will you download the Nintendo app
on your phone I I
haven't are you going to play the new
Pokemon in the switch 2 version
yes um GameCube not much to say other
than smash melee never but GameCube has
such a good
library that it's nice to look forward
to those games I know it's easy to
emulate chat I know I've played some of
these games a million times but it's
also nice to have them there you could
just have them on your system and they
could just take up many gigabytes of
space so that you have to buy their
brand new SD
card I hope they keep the bad taste
coding will you buy the tech demo game
um if it's if it's cheap
and I think it would be a fun
stream I personally okay if I wasn't a
streamer 100% no that looked really
dumb there is the slightest chance I
would play it and stream it because
there could be some fun material there
but if it's like a full PRC game I can't
see myself wanting
that will you buy the camera I really
don't want to you I don't even like
being on camera on my stream
[Music]
will we ever get Wind Waker HD Twilight
Princess HD ports now we may never see
that that's a good question I was
thinking about that when they were
showing Wind Waker um I think it's still
possible cuz Nintendo likes
money but I think for
now just the GameCube version of Wind
Waker so probably not for a while
cyber Punk playthrough again no I'm
good look at the roster for Mario Kart
World um let's see Mario Kart World
roster I don't know
so Mario Luigi Bowser Princess Peach
Yoshi Donkey Kong toad Berto Toadette
Rosalina Waluigi Daisy Koopa troa Baby
Luigi that's
just um you can play as a
cow uh I saw
that thoughts on the from soft game
brand new releasing exclusively on
switch are you did you just
join um how did they even get this to
happen it's
nuts listen um I don't want to talk too
much about it CU I already did a bunch I
think it looks cool that's a day one for
me cuz I I think it just is my kind of
thing but I think as I said earlier the
landscape of where Nintendo is at now is
very very different when people were
saying they're nintend done the switch
to is like catching up to the
PlayStation 2 is highest selling console
of all time that doesn't mean it's the
best that doesn't
mean really that you know they just earn
the right to have Borderlands and crazy
Randy in his wonderful suit oh Randy
Pitchford why do you why do you do
this he was just standing there in his
crazy purple suit and he was just like
listen I'm going to go nuts is that okay
can you film me going nuts about this
game that looks very similar to the
previous games we put out and they did
so no there's some actual like yeah I
mean Delta Rune and all that stuff like
there's some pretty decently excited um
sorry uh titles people are excited for
releasing on the switch 2 either on
launch or right around
there and I think um yeah generally
Nintendo could have probably paid from
soft for an exclusive
but I don't think it would take very
much convincing I think when you have a
console like the switch one where
Nintendo sold that well and you have
games that sold like you know Animal
Crossing sold what 30 40 million units
something like that Mario Kart 75
million yeah I don't think there's any
real surprise why people want to release
their games on the switch even when the
switch one came out there was a huge
boost to Indie Games
like if you got in ground level on the
switch one and you're an indie game
developer publisher you were selling a
lot because that was just people wanted
to play it on the
go I do feel like that novelty is over a
bit because there's more options there's
more ways to play stuff people already
have a switch one for indie games um
there's steam
decks so I think that appeal is kind of
diminished a bit but when people get
their switch to and they spend their
$450 fucking dollars on it they're going
to want to get value out of it and um
yeah so but I think it's going to do
just fine I think the price is going to
hurt it because
$250 and $400 are very different I know
there's inflation sorry $450 it's $200
price difference I know there's
inflation I know there's you know all
this stuff going on in the world but
that's just a number that people see and
it's like ooh whereas 250 was like oh
that's not
bad so I don't see switch 2 topping
switch one in sales I don't I don't see
that I think it's going to do great I
think it's going to do just fine but um
I'm not surprised from soft was happy to
do a game they did it on the PlayStation
and that game is locked forever away on
the PS4 stuck in hell people to this day
hoping and coping
I do hope one day that game gets off the
switch to and goes to PC that would be
my wish that they don't do the same
bloodborne
mistake so all right
um we have uh a couple more minutes and
then I don't know I I already
have awakened so
early word on the street is the digital
version of Mario Kart World will be
cheaper than the physical Version
Nintendo may be trying to phase out
physical
games um I think that would be the goal
for every major publisher uh and uh
people who make them video
games it saves them on manufacturing I
don't want physical to go away I still
do physical as anytime I can I'm really
happy to have the actual cartridge or
the the
disc so um I really hope that's not the
case but if Mario Kart on its own is 80
bucks but if you get the
bundle it's 50 people are going to get
the
bundle key post did a tweet of it being
80 on
digital Donkey Kong is 70 bucks right I
saw
that there's info for the new type of
key game card it's just a key that and
you download the
rest yeah that I don't love um that I
don't love I I actually would never
choose that over a game card because um
as you've seen chat shit happens what
happens is games get delisted
games end up losing certain rights like
for music
sometimes um you know Nintendo locks
their shit away in vaults from time to
time this is why emulation is important
this is why physical media is
important
so I would very much prefer to have a
game on a
cartridge I don't want to say I would
pay an extra 10
bucks I wouldn't want to but cuz we we
shouldn't fucking have to uh but yeah
I'm just saying it would be a game key I
it's happened before like I think it was
like the Starfield collector's edition
or do you know when you buy a
collector's edition and you get a
steelbook and there's no game and you
just get a game key or you don't even
get
that like that shit is dumb
um I don't know how people can keep
complaining about Rising egg prices when
they can buy 500 uh $450 for Nintendo to
be honest I would assume you don't have
a PlayStation then right or a computer
now here's the thing about
that
eggs and gaming are very different and
the
people that are broke are starved for
dopamine so it's it's like I think it
would be nice if egg prices were normal
and they've kind of been lowering again
but I think it's too very different
things I get what you're saying you have
a point but I do think people are
willing to spend the extra money for
whether it's a good thing or not just to
find some happiness in their life when
things feel like
garbage um but that said I think the 450
you're making a big assumption here too
if people can't afford
eggs I do think some people are going to
have a real hard time wanting to spend
another 450 bucks so especially if they
already have other game
consoles I think that's going to be
reflected in the sales I know that
um it seems the main thing people want
me to keep talking about is the
price
and you know Sony shot themselves in the
foot with the $599 us back in the
day and you know a price has been known
to make or break especially like Xbox I
you know that is now
I don't even know what people are doing
with Xboxes or if they're even selling
at all but I think you know
having a switch and a PS4 at the time
seemed like a good thing because you had
the cheaper switch for indie games and
Nintendo games and then if you wanted
you used your PlayStation 4 or your
computer for the new shit for the the
really goodlooking
shit and now Nintendo is kind of closing
the Gap a little bit and you have
something here that's a little more
modern I've said this a 100 times but
the switch one was outdated when it came
out so it's nice to get games with
actual like good FPS less compromises
you know cyber Punk is on the
thing um but now that's going to be like
a tougher purchase for people that maybe
bought a PS5 recently or upgraded their
computer recently
and that's going to be up to them to buy
a game like Mario Kart like how much is
the software going to sell those
people if it was 250 or 300 sure but at
the current price point yeah it's it's
going to be we'll see I mean we'll see
how it plays
out but so that's what people want me to
talk about and that's what I've talked
about a lot is the price and I
hope you know I hope that uh they don't
charge 80 bucks for every fucking
game this was just whelming says a chat
member I'm pretty welmed I would say
yeah the Donkey Kong thing looks good
there was nothing that blew me
away and I'll wrap up my thoughts now
cuz I've been talking for a long time I
slept like 4 and 1 half hours because
I'm dumbass as
usual once again kind of like the switch
one
presentation it was perfectly
welmed I'm underwhelmed by some of the
price decisions I'm underwhelmed by some
of the hardware in regards to the camera
and the microphone they spent like 10
minutes on that shit whatever 5 minutes
um you know I really liked the way Mario
Kart looks I Donkey Kong looks cool new
from soft game there's cool shit knowing
Prime 4 is on the switch to
is pretty exciting it's not like
life-changing but it's
exciting um Kirby air ride being a big
secret reveal is completely fine it
wasn't something for me that like if it
was oh if it was kidicarus that would be
a different story that's just
personal some of the third party stuff
they showed like it's cool that enter
the gungeon 2 is
happening and then there was plenty of
other shit that was just
like once again I'm just like huh like
you're charging money for a weird beta
uh sorry not a beta Museum um like a
weird you know like bad astrobot like
where you just walk around and learn
about the system and play some mini
games that's weird so that should be
included that should be
free so um yeah I don't know I mean it
there's definitely some usual
Nintendo bizarre decisions um but yet
other games that looked good I think um
Nintendo's going to be showing off thing
in
person they're going to be um doing tree
houses you know if the launch is
basically just Mario Kart and some old
games and I don't know a couple things
like Donkey Kong right after that's cool
but I'm really curious to see what
they're going to have for holiday
season I'm curious to see where they're
going to go beyond that so um yeah it's
fine
all right chat I don't really have much
else to say

to be streaming the tree houses I'm I'm
good on that if I end up at the the
event which I don't have um I I didn't
get confirmed for probably won't end up
at the switch 2 event but I'll let you
know if I do and I'll talk about it
obviously otherwise I'll just kind of um

them and uh yeah that's it
I just want to say thank you for
listening to my garbage opinions as
always thanks for um being here uh chat

bit better so I you have my deepest
appreciation for spending this time
