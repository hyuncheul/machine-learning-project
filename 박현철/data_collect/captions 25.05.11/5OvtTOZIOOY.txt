this is me one of the first people in the world 
playing a Nintendo Switch 2 And you might be  
wondering how I got here It all started when 
Nintendo invited me to this early access Switch  
2 event So thank you Nintendo for inviting me 
to this event which really worked out because  
I lost the lottery for the hands-on public New 
York City Switch 2 event In this video I'll be  
sharing my complete 3-hour hands-on with the 
Nintendo Switch 2 and I'll be going over the  
games and features I got to test out By the way 
don't forget to hit that like and subscribe button  
and turn on notifications cuz I'll be covering 
a ton of Nintendo Switch 2 content Now one of  
the first things I did as soon as I arrived at the 
event was head over to where they were displaying  
the Nintendo Switch 2Os These Nintendo Switch 2Os 
were presented on top of its own glorious lightup  
stand and I was able to immediately get my hands 
on it Now as soon as I held on to the Switch 2 I  
could already feel the major difference in premium 
quality from the Switch One from the OLED jumping  
to the Switch 2 This felt a lot bigger The texture 
felt a lot more premium I I mean the word premium  
is a strange one that I'm using but it just feels 
expensive And I think Nintendo is doing their best  
to match the current handheld markets that are 
existing Now the screen is bigger It's 7.9 LCD  
screen which is a big jump from the 6.2 in one 
which means you're getting a 60% more viewing  
area It has 1080p resolution It has HDR support 
and the Switch itself has up to 120 Hz variable  
refresh rate depending on what game you're playing 
Overall it's for smoother gameplay and much better  
optimization It's not an OLED screen but an LCD 
screen but the way it's done the colors were  
just so vibrant on it And personally I think 
the color reproduction on it is doing a great  
job to match or even outdo the OLED And we know 
Nintendo eventually will come out with their own  
OLED version eventually Now the kickstand on the 
Nintendo Switch 2 is very interesting because on  
the original Switch One the kickstand was just 
this little flap right over here just like it's  
just this little little tiny flap It was this 
little tiny flap and it limited the mobility of  
how far back you can place your switch That's it 
You couldn't move it more than that or you close  
it completely Then on the OLED they came out 
with this much thicker kickstand which allowed  
your Switch to be placed down at various different 
angles You can completely place it down flat just  
like this or at various angles And the Switch 2 
did not disappoint with their design which was a  
lot more thinner It feels a little more flimsier 
compared to the Switch 2 but that's only because  
I'm used to the thick kickstand but in its own 
way It's sturdy and it does its job I just have  
a little fear of it because it's a lot thinner 
than the Switch OLED But I believe it does the job  
exactly and has the same mobility and can land on 
tabletop mode And honestly if you're careful with  
your device you shouldn't have to worry anyway Now 
let's talk about the JoyCons because I feel like  
the JoyCons have made a significant improvement 
from the basic Switch JoyCons Now they are a  
lot more larger and a lot more ergonomic than the 
previous ones I mean holding those Joy-Cons feel  
completely different and I hate the fact that 
I now come home back to these Switch JoyCons  
It just doesn't feel the same anymore after 
holding a Switch to one And I really want to  
hold the Switch 2 JoyCons Now they deattach by 
pressing this button at the back of them over  
here in this footage Just press that and they pop 
right out And to reattach them all you have to do  
is insert it from the bottom and have this magnet 
just slide into place I did it a couple of times  
to get used to it It's a lot of fun and it feels 
better than the original JoyCons just sliding  
into the regular Switch One Switch two ones are 
just phenomenal The magnet system is clean It's  
sturdy It's safe It's not going to break like the 
memes that were posted online about the Switch 2  
design being flawed when putting those in Like 
seriously you get this really cool snap-on feel  
when you put it on Let's also just talk about the 
biggest improvement of the Joy-Con and that is  
going to be the fact that they fix these SL and SR 
buttons These things are so tiny When you try to  
play with the Joy-Con you're literally like it's 
like your little gremlin trying to click on this  
the controllers It was horrible experience on the 
Switch One Absolutely hated it But when I got to  
see the Switch 2 version of this they were like 
three times bigger than what we had on the Switch  
One Hence why it is a bigger console and the 
Joy-Cons are a lot larger Now these buttons got  
plenty of use when I played Street Fighter which 
I'll talk about later in the video as I'm going  
to give my experience of the various games that I 
was able to play during my time But it's amazing  
how changing the buttons makes the Joy-Cons feel 
a lot more premium and a lot better like it just  
it just felt really good Now the analog sticks 
were also uh larger than the previous Nintendo  
Switch Joy-Cons and they nicely maintained their 
low profile as well on the Switch too Also as you  
can see that lovely C button is there to give you 
voice chat in the game and to do the connection  
stuff with other people with the camera but 
unfortunately we were not able to test that out  
during the event But we'll get back to some camera 
feature that I did get to test out in the video  
Now the JoyCons also can enter something known 
as mouse mode as there are optical sensors on  
each Joy-Con that allow you to do it And I'm able 
to actually demo that in a game for you to show  
you its full capacity In fact I actually did it 
in two games where I did use the mouse But tor  
the console is just a lot bigger It looks a lot 
better and it has a nice premium expensive feel  
to it Now let's move on to the first game that 
I played which is Mario Kart World And I'll give  
you my breakdown of everything I experienced in 
this game By the way you see this guy over here  
This is my friend and YouTuber Rogers Base who 
will be joining me throughout this experience as  
we basically played almost every game together 
In fact throughout this video we actually end  
up battling each other in a ton of different games 
and challenging each other Starting off with Mario  
Kart World Now as soon as we were able to boot 
up our demo of this game we were hit with so many  
characters We were both literally freaking out and 
seeing how many characters were already available  
Zakowi Waluigi Wait I'm not even noticing the 
skin Zakow's here All terrain Mario Hold on  
Hold on This is There's a lot here The crazy part 
is all the characters weren't even unlocked yet  
And this was just such a giant plethora of 
characters already available with different  
skins It It already was looking great Now as you 
can see what me and Roger did was the Grand Prix  
on split screen So we're both playing on the same 
Nintendo Switch He selected Roselina and I had to  
represent everyone out there by selecting the 
cow the legend itself that completely shined  
in Mario Kart Everyone is just obsessed with the 
cow so I had to pick the cow We also had a giant  
selection of vehicles to select from which was 
really awesome There's a carpet I roll the carpet  
flyer It's crazy And the first racing map that we 
tried out was the Peach Stadium map for the Grand  
Prix mode Now immediately right off the gate Roger 
took off and was nailing it He was in first place  
He was destroying And me uh trying to get used to 
the new Switch controllers I I I didn't know what  
to do for a moment until I realized my muscle 
memory kicked in and I realized these are just  
bigger Switch controls And I started to go hard 
and we started to enjoy and and race And the crazy  
part is Mario Kart World has 24 racers in it Do 
you understand how chaotic this game is now that  
they increase it They let anyone in the game You 
got crabs you got dolphins and you got me the cow  
Anyway once I was able to figure out the controls 
properly uh in Mario Kart World I was then able  
to proceed forward And there were a lot of crazy 
things happening I mean the backgrounds of these  
maps have so much going on in them It's crazy 
And there's so much detail that they put into  
the game that you could easily get distracted by 
looking away On top of that there are 24 racers in  
the game So there is absolute chaos going on And 
before you know it you could get hit by a rocket  
You could get hit by a giant size One of the 
racers could be giant And we even had a strange  
moment in our race where we all just turned into 
goombas And I'm still trying to figure out what  
turned us all into glmbbas in the middle of the 
race Anyway as this race proceeded on me and Roger  
formed an alliance that we were not going to let 
this dolphin win because this one NPC this dolphin  
was outdoing both me and Roger and kind of being a 
pain in the butt So me and Roger's truce was that  
as long as the dolphin doesn't win we win Roger 
and I secured first and second place in our first  
Grand Prix making this a complete success And the 
split screen mode felt pretty good I was able to  
focus on my side Roger was able to focus on his 
side So this is definitely a mode I think you're  
going to enjoy if you're playing with somebody at 
home Now after this we were both handed a switch  
to console with Mario Kart World on it So that 
way we can experience the racing in handheld mode  
The map that I raced on for this one was known as 
the DK Spaceport map And once I was given handheld  
mode I again was staring at all the characters 
in the game because there are just so many I  
eventually selected Peach Yukata version and I 
was able to have a lot of fun racing in handheld  
mode Honestly it felt good playing in this mode 
as well Just having bigger controllers and having  
such a larger screen made it very easy to play the 
game and enjoy it And the controls felt perfectly  
fine But the DK spaceport map was I think one 
of my favorite ones is there was just a mecca  
Donkey Kong just throwing barrels at you now And I 
can't wait for you guys to play this when you get  
your hands on it Now after we completed this game 
mode we then walked into the next area where I was  
introduced to a bunch of Nintendo staff that was 
clapping for me because I was the best Mario Kart  
World player I'm just kidding They're clapping 
because we just entered the new area Once we got  
there they set us up on all these stations There 
were a bunch of people there Each person got their  
own station and what we were going to experience 
was the game mode called Knockout Tour For the  
Knockout Tour I was able to use the Nintendo 
Switch 2 Pro Controller which felt really really  
good So while everyone is queuing up for Knockout 
Tour and once you select your character and the  
vehicle I selected this specific Daisy and the 
magic carpet that just looks perfect I don't know  
it felt like a whole new world Mario Kart World I 
was able to do some free roaming So while everyone  
is queuing up free roam is fully enabled I was 
falling down all the way and then I landed into  
water So it's crazy to see in free roam that you 
literally can go anywhere This means even falling  
off of a cliff and then you're just in water and 
you're just enjoying and cruising and the vehicles  
transform as soon as it hits a different surface 
So this is really exciting But however that is  
going to end as soon as all the players are ready 
The free room turns off You'll get a notification  
and the knockout tour begins Essentially what you 
don't want to be is in last place And Nakur is a  
really smooth game mode in Mario Kart World In 
fact it is the best game mode It is my favorite  
one because of how fast it just moves You're 
consistently moving from one map to another map  
to another map to another map until the winner 
is decided Now the cool thing is if you are in  
first place during this game mode your character 
is automatically wearing the crown But I would not  
experience this because pride comes before a fall 
as I was very confident from my abilities battling  
Roger And I was actually one of the first people 
completely knocked out uh in this game mode There  
are a lot of competitive gamers here And this is 
what I mean by absolute chaos You could see how  
many people just kept knocking me out uh hitting 
me with various question mark items Yeah I just  
got completely demolished and I'm going to get my 
revenge one day But yes I was the first person out  
in this game mode So I just had to watch Roger 
play and see how far Roger could get and Roger  
Also Roger got pretty far which was really awesome 
And Roger played as the cow and another cow took  
him out but that's okay But honestly Knockout 
Tour was one of the favorite modes that everyone  
enjoyed And this is going to be the most popular 
mode that everyone is going to play because of  
how fast how smooth and how clean the gameplay is 
After Mario Kart we entered an area where there  
were all these games that were there to try that 
were going to be available on the Nintendo Switch  
2 And one of the first skins we went over to was 
Drag X Drive because I just had to test out the  
features and how the mouse feature specifically 
works since this game requires you to have both  
JoyCons and to have to drag them in order to get 
your character going Anyway let me explain how  
this went down So the station that we went to had 
a mouse pad set up with two JoyCons that we had to  
put on our wrist to strap up completely Now what 
you had to do was drag forward for your character  
to move forward If you pull back your character 
pulls back And what's really cool is you can  
actually feel the HD rumble inside of the Joy-Con 
So it almost felt like if you were to grab an  
actual wheelchair It felt like I was legitimately 
pulling a wheel back That's all I have to say The  
rumble is amazing on this Anyway we had to go 
through a tutorial first on how to play this  
game So we were learning all the various ways of 
moving moving backwards moving forward If you take  
your character and pull one side your character 
is going to completely turn If you slide your left  
Joy-Con your character is going to turn another 
direction really interesting It's I feel like  
this is a really strong tech demo specifically 
for the mouse Uh this whole game feels like it  
just wants to really use the mouse feature Uh it's 
a very gimmicky game Not only that but there are a  
lot of tech things in the game that you can do For 
example my character was able to pick up one side  
of the wheelchair and then if you quickly pick 
up the other side your character then jumps in  
the air glide on and and do these cool tricks And 
on the bottom left of the screen you'll actually  
will see the style trick you do Some other cool 
things about the game is you can pass the ball  
to another teammate If you flick your wrist the 
basketball will just go in If you zoom really fast  
into an opponent you can knock the ball right out 
of them which is really cool Uh the Joy-Cons when  
you pick them up off of the uh mat you can wave 
with one of them basically indicating "Hey throw  
the ball I'm open." You can get both So you can 
wave with both hands And here's what's cool You  
could also clap your hands by taking both of the 
JoyCons together and just doing doing a motion  
So it was pretty interesting We had a 3v3 game 
which was absolutely chaotic because I was just  
trying to figure out how to turn my character and 
whenever I got the ball I just shot it Um you have  
to be close enough to the basket to shoot it Uh 
if you're too far or you're not really facing it  
the accuracy is not good and the game suggests 
that you have a good line of sight to the hoop  
when you're throwing the ball in Yeah that that 
was it I'm sure this game is going to go through  
more optimization as it does have a summer release 
And later on in the video you're going to see me  
use the mouse feature again but for a different 
game But first we have to test out the camera  
feature And for that we're going to have to play 
a game known as Super Mario Party Jamberee but  
the brand new Jamberee TV version of this that is 
going to be on the Switch 2 Now Jamberee TV is a  
feature that is only going to be on the Nintendo 
Switch 2 as it's going to utilize the Switch  
camera feature Now I wasn't able to test out the 
camera feature as I mentioned earlier in terms  
of video chatting but we were definitely able to 
test out the camera feature in how it works with  
this specific game Now initially when we all were 
getting started we had four squares on the TV that  
showed up and we just had to position ourselves 
in that specific square because that's where all  
these sensors would take place within the game Of 
course me and Roger were going to be on different  
teams because we had to verse each other uh as our 
Roger and Philly challenge continues uh in this  
video So Roger paired up with one Nintendo staff 
member I paired up with one Nintendo staff member  
We started off by doing the specific mode known 
as the Bowser live mode It almost feels like a  
game show where Bowser just comes out and he just 
looks at us and we are get to wave and we get to  
see our full characters just waving and we do 
little dances and stuff and it's really cool to  
see yourself in the game on TV I It's kind of fun 
I think a lot of crazy stuff is going to happen  
when people play that game Maybe some cool dance 
moves Anyway there were three specific games we  
played using the camera feature The first one 
was uh catching glmbbas So you had to carefully  
stack these glmbbas as they came down Uh and 
the team that had the most glmbbas would win  
Now what was really interesting is I thought 
they would just stick on my head and I could  
just move my head really fast but it's actually 
sensitive to that So if you move too fast some of  
the glmbbas just just they fall right off They 
they're gone Like they they'll knock out You  
have to do it again So because I I didn't know 
that I stacked up a bunch I they dropped and  
uh we lost by one point to Rogers team for the 
first game However we're weren't going to let  
that set us back as the next game required no 
Joy-Con use at all In fact it was just us using  
our hands and we're hitting a block right above 
our head You know this was this was a cakewalk  
All you have to do is just you know spam the fist 
going up which actually ended up being a really  
big workout I noticed you do have to be perfectly 
in frame though cuz if my hand extended a little  
bit too high it would then just not register So 
you really got to be below that uh to really hit  
that brick if that makes sense Of course like 
I said that was an easy one Walk in the park  
Then came the third one uh which was a battle 
of who can scream the loudest and this one is  
just absolutely chaotic So what's going to happen 
is Bows is going to face one group and we have to  
yell and you're going to see a little volume meter 
show up So whichever team screams the loudest  
is good to go So you know for some reason I was 
hitting these really high-pitched notes uh while
yelling I don't know where that came from And 
everyone on the floor by the way that you're  
not seeing is literally staring at it Who are 
these people screaming Anyway we went back and  
forth Roger tried to pull out his secret 
weapon by doing a Super Smash Bros Sora
reaction Oh my god Oh my god But what uh he 
didn't realize was that he already blew his  
voice screaming over the Nintendo Switch 2 
presentation So obviously we won Uh that was  
easy Roger already lost his voice and my team 
won And that's pretty much what it is Um there  
are a bunch of other game modes using that That 
wasn't all the camera features cuz in the trailer  
they did show more Um and it's kind of fun that 
they added this onto it I think it's going to  
make Super Mario Party Jamberee a lot more fun now 
that they included this because there is a Switch  
2 version And the camera definitely works well 
with this game The next game that we played was  
Street Fighter 6 And this game looks amazing on 
the Nintendo Switch too I actually played Street  
Fighter 6 a lot earlier when Capcom invited me 
out to another event before and honestly on the  
Switch 2 I cannot tell the difference between the 
PlayStation 5 version and the Switch 2 version I  
think it just looks good and it might be because 
of the artistic style of the game But anyway we  
were able to play this but in Nintendo Switch 2 
style What I mean by this is that we were using  
Switch 2 motion controllers using the Joy-Cons 
And by JoyCons I mean one single Joy-Con So we  
were actually able to start using the SL and 
SR This is where we got to test out battling  
with a Joy-Con We had a wrist strap it and we 
were doing a bunch of different controllers We  
were shaking our Joy-Con to make the character's 
attacking If we tilted the Joy-Con to the left the  
character would back up If we tilted to the right 
the character would go to the right And just the  
various controls were really interesting and it 
was a really fun way of playing Street Fighter  
6 Of course Roger picked Cammy and I picked Jury 
and we were just having this straight out battle  
Roger won the first one I won the second one Roger 
won the third one and then we were introduced to  
a complete surprising mode known as the calorie 
contest So this was all about just who could land  
as many attacks as possible and you're burning 
calories while doing it Basically it ended up with  
me and Roger just spamming our controllers and 
shaking it And we were sweating We were actually  
getting a legitimate workout while doing this 
So uh if you made a hit on the opponent you'd  
get their points And it was just this chaotic 
back and forth This is a really fun switch mode  
because once the fight was over of course uh Roger 
beat me because this man plays a lot of fighting  
games Once that was over the end of the screen has 
an estimate calorie count of how much you burned  
And I'm telling you I was so out of breath from 
spamming and shaking the Joy-Con controller And  
my arms were actually hurting It was It was like 
I legit just did a forearm workout on top of like  
just sweating My heart was pounding We actually 
took off our jackets before we even did this game  
mode and thank goodness we did that because wow 
it was it was a very intense one So I definitely  
think Street Fighter 6 on the Nintendo Switch 2 
is a very fun game Uh I think the calorie mode is  
going to be great Now on this channel I covered a 
ton of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom So being able to  
finally see Tears of the Kingdom in 60 frames per 
second on a glorious beautiful screen with buttery  
smooth gameplay was something I was really really 
looking forward to So me and Roger went over to  
the booth and we had the option of choosing Breath 
of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom And obviously  
I chose Tears of the Kingdom because that's 
the most modern one and it's basically Breath  
of the Wild but upgraded Now the first thing was 
being handed the entire Switch consoles to play  
in handheld mode This alone seeing how smooth 
that was in itself was great It was phenomenal  
The game looked great I actually just played the 
opening sequence of Tears of the Kingdom where  
Link falls down and then you talk to the construct 
and then your demo just ends And that was that was  
enough for me just to look at the water and be 
like mind blown by it But of course playing on  
the television screen with the docked mode is 
obviously a lot more insane than that which I  
took turns to let Roger do it so we could get 
through this booth a lot faster And I was just  
standing there in awe When Roger booted it up he 
was basically at where a boss fight battle would  
be but it didn't matter He just jumped right off 
down in the Zoro domain area And wow the water was  
crazy I mean just we stare at water We're We're 
nerds You can see us freaking out over this in  
this clip Oh you're in the best spot You're in the 
best spot So much water Then we wanted to test out  
how fast it was to teleport to another area cuz 
we wanted to see the environment there And here  
it is Here's how fast it took 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Okay 7 
seconds It took a total of 7 seconds to do that Uh  
and in the new area Roger was able to check that 
out just explore and we were just mind blown And  
honestly for anyone who has never played Breath 
of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom this is going  
to be one of the greatest experiences you are 
ever going to have If you have already played  
Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild I wish 
I never did because this would have been the best  
way to experience it ever The next game I got my 
hands on was Metroid Prime 4 Beyond the Switch 2  
Edition where I was able to once again be able to 
use the mouse features Now this game is completely  
gorgeous It is jaw-dropping the way the cinematics 
are right from the start of the demo I was playing  
in 120fps HDR at 1080p The game was buttery smooth 
I mean it was just amazing to look at Visually  
stunning in all ways I think one of the most 
amazing things that the team has done with this  
game is make the Joy-Cons seamless transition from 
the mouse modes It's actually really impressive  
Like you could be holding it in mouse mode and 
then pick it up and the game just registers the  
fact that you're no longer in the mouse mode and 
you're playing manually which is impressive But  
the way I personally enjoyed playing Metroid Prime 
4 Beyond was using my left hand to do directional  
movement and the right hand to be in mouse mode 
so I can completely aim at enemies And this demo  
was pretty solid I was able to learn how to shoot 
at enemies use my missile attacks shoot my cannon  
attacks I also learned that Samus can roll up in 
a ball and do some plasma attacks As I progressed  
further in the demo I started doing different 
texts where I just run up to an enemy drop plasma  
bombs as opposed to aiming and shooting Actually 
different ways of taking out enemies in the game  
So it was really interesting to see what Samus can 
do There was a little bit of a mini puzzle where  
you scan your face and then it opens up this mini 
game where you have to shoot all four corners of  
the screen to proceed through a door Um that was 
the only one I've seen I'm pretty sure they're  
going to have way more stuff in the game in terms 
of puzzles During my playthrough of this I also  
got to have a big boss fight Uh it was a giant 
nasty alien boss fight U the boss had full-blown  
mechanics a giant health bar Uh I was dodging I 
was doing double jumps I had to turn into a ball  
to avoid certain attacks The boss would always aim 
at you You would have to get out the way So it was  
cool to see a lot of movement tech happening while 
the boss is consistently attacking you and you're  
waiting to shoot the boss at its vulnerable points 
That was really fun I had a great time with this  
boss fight and I'm pretty sure there are going to 
be a lot more difficult bosses in this game It's  
such a good-looking game and I'm really curious 
what will be the most popular way of playing the  
game I wonder if it's going to be my style of 
left hand and then right hand on the mouse pad  
And by the way I've never played a Metroid game uh 
before I only played Samus in Smash Bros So being  
able to see it I wasn't as excited But now that 
I've played the game I am so excited to get my  
hands on this when it launches This game is chef's 
kiss Now after this Roger and I were figuring out  
what game we should play next when we stumbled 
across the Nintendo Gamecube Nintendo Classic  
The crazy part is that this is launching with 
the Switch 2 immediately with a bunch of games  
at the launch Now not only was this available for 
the preview but they had the GameCube controller  
that you could purchase and it was a little bit 
smaller than the original Gamecube but it was  
like the right fit for the hand If you played a 
GameCube in the past it's fully intuitive with  
how to handle the controller Really well done 
I'm actually really excited to get my hands on  
this GameCube controller when it does come out 
There were four games that we could choose from  
during this hands-on The Legend of Zelda Wind 
Waker F-ZeroGX Mario Strikers and Soulcalibur 2  
Now because me and Roger were having a bit of a 
competition today we first selected Soulcalibur  
2 Now Soulcalibur 2 is really interesting because 
it has Link in the game which means we get to play  
as Link Now before we start our fight I do want 
to mention that some of these Gamecube titles  
actually have widescreen support So that was one 
of the first things we did We turned on widescreen  
so we would get more real estate on the screen 
so we can enjoy the game further I mean just  
look at the difference from regular to widescreen 
After that we both selected Link to have the best  
battle of the links and we were off to the fight 
Now Link is really interesting in Soulcalibur too  
because he has all his abilities with using the 
arrows the bows the sword It's really fun to use  
Now Roger cooked me in round one but in round two 
I actually figured out how to use every single one  
of these abilities and I demolish Roger I even did 
a finisher with a bomb to completely destroy him  
And then Soulcalibur has a replay system that 
shows the finish at a different angle So it  
was just a really cool finisher And that's all I 
could do to Roger because after that we selected  
different characters and Roger absolutely cooked 
me with Ivy and then later on cooked me with  
Lizard Man So the SoCal challenge goes to Roger 
After that we then wanted to try another game  
F0GX that we had to do a racing game At this point 
we were racing or we were fighting all night And  
F-ZeroGX was something we had to do F-ZeroGX also 
supported widescreens We immediately turn that on  
And when you race somebody you have the option of 
making it a vertical split between two characters  
or a horizontal split between the players We stuck 
with whatever was a default in the game and we  
selected from the racers and we just had a blast 
I mean the game looks really really well done for  
being a GameCube game I think they did a little 
something on here to make it a little better After  
we selected our racers apparently a lot of them 
are unlocked I didn't realize how many characters  
are there in F-Zero There is so many characters 
After we selected our characters though we then  
selected the stage called Casino and we just had a 
blast We were just racing across the area We were  
hitting speed bumps We were sharing the same brain 
cell and sometimes we fell off It was a really  
really fun time It was so fun I even beat Roger at 
a game he played back in the day and it was great  
Also after playing this Nintendo please release 
an F-Zero game That was a lot of fun So fighting  
on the Gamecube goes to Roger but racing on the 
Gamecube goes to Philly Beats You Now don't worry  
we're getting to Donkey Kong Bonanza That this is 
like the peak moment of the entire experience But  
before that I do want to talk about some other 
Switch games that I got to play One of the big  
ones was Cyberpunk Being able to see Cyberpunk 
on a Nintendo Switch was kind of mind-blowing  
And when I asked them how they did it they told 
me the engineers pulled off some crazy magic to  
make this happen Now what I did notice when I did 
boot up Cyberpunk which by the way is still being  
optimized and tweaked for the Nintendo Switch 2 
This is again a preview so don't take everything  
that I experience now as something that's going 
to happen later But Cyberpunk as soon as I booted  
up a loaded save file it took a bit to load in 
because once you are actually loaded in there's  
just so much There's no loading transitions I had 
to deal with I was able to fight enemies shoot at  
enemies run into a town talk to NPCs there I 
mean there's NPCs and things happening all the  
time Different sound effects music It feels alive 
The graphics quality for this is not obviously as  
peak as a PC but the fact that all these NPCs 
and objects and interactions are happening on  
the Nintendo Switch 2 is very very impressive 
I was also able to fully run out take a car and  
start driving and fight a bunch of enemies in an 
open area with my gun and using a a string waving  
attack It was cool It was a great time And I'm 
really interested to see how Cyberpunk is going  
to optimize in the future to make the battery 
drain be even less on the Switch because I was  
told you probably get about two hours one to two 
hours of battery life per Switch run because I  
mean it's a very powerful game So you'll probably 
be able to get a mission or two and that's that's  
a good cadence of playing the game if you are 
doing it Maybe playing Cyberpunk on a road ride  
Maybe you're playing Cyberpunk as a passenger 
in a car where you have to wait for an hour You  
get a little Cyberpunk mission The game's full of 
content so it's great to see on the Switch Anyway  
after playing Cyberpunk I then went over to play 
Yakuza Zero: The Director's Cut which is coming  
out on the Switch and then it's going to be filled 
with a ton of content It's a fun game You fight a  
lot of enemies in different styles It's It's very 
violent It's a very violent game Now during the  
event there were a ton of other games like Hades 
2 Civilization and there's just so many things  
I wanted to get my hands on but time was of the 
essence And one of the big ones that I had to play  
was Donkey Kong Bonanza which was shown to us at 
the end So once you finish the experience you come  
to the end and you get to play Donkey Kong Bonanza 
And this game right from the start looked visually  
insane You immediately start to smash things with 
Donkey Kong right from the start of the game And  
it's really cool how the controls work on the 
Joy-Con for this Essentially you get to smash  
things up with the X button smash things right 
in front of you with the Y button smash things  
below you with the B button and A is simply going 
to allow you to jump You're just breaking as many  
things as possible But what I was shown was the 
opening sequence of the game of getting through  
breaking bananas figuring out how things work and 
then we had this crazy cutscene where this entire  
evil organization just slams down the entire area 
And then we have this transition where Donkey Kong  
is in this island And this island looks really 
familiar Like the vibes I got was just like Zelda:  
Tears of the Kingdom on the first sky island that 
you're in This is what it kind of felt like for  
the Donkey Kong game except he can destroy every 
single thing in the game And it starts to become  
this very addicting breaking game like you want to 
just consistently keep breaking everything because  
there are so many secrets hidden throughout the 
map I mean there's gold there's coins there's  
fossils different kinds of fossils there's 
bananas there's just so many things that you  
want to keep breaking on the map to find And 
it's insane how the physics work in this game  
If you press a certain button on your controller 
Donkey Kong will just grab the earth below him or  
a rock in front of him pick it up and you could 
just throw rocks at enemies Just throw these  
things Not only just throw it you can hop on it 
and it completely spins like a tabletop And the  
physics are so insane that the spinning top you do 
on any of the materials or the rocks it actually  
wears down where it disappears So you can't be 
on it forever You could jump up surfaces with  
it or you can glide down areas with it Now there 
were different kinds of enemies There were enemies  
that ran at you in the beginning of the game 
and you just punch them And there were enemies  
that required you to pick up this earth and throw 
things at There were also these challenges that I  
would encounter Uh you just drop down and you're 
thrown into a sequence The one I encountered was  
fighting three enemies that you have to defeat 
in a certain amount of time So just break them  
punch them you beat them and you get a banana 
And essentially that's like the beauty of the  
game you just get bananas for doing these tasks 
Now the demo that I played specifically kept me  
in that one area of the island Uh so if you 
did try to progress past a certain point it  
just reloaded you back in the area And I did 
have a 20inut session to play this game But  
visually it is really fun Breaking objects 
extremely satisfying You just want to keep  
breaking more and more And the way they built this 
game Donkey Kong can break everything Everything  
And if there's something he can't break 
well there's something he can throw at it  
In fact there's certain objects that explode 
certain objects that only work by getting hit  
with explosive damage There's secret pathways 
underground areas I mean there's just so much  
to do in this game It's absolutely mind-blowing 
And then Roger and I met up and said "Let's do  
a speedrun challenge to see who can get the most 
collectibles." And when you're speedr runninging  
against somebody trying to smash rocks all 
over the place trying to see who could find  
the most collectibles this game gets a new level 
of competition Like who could get the most fossils  
who could get the most bananas and we were having 
a blast In fact because we came back the second  
time and we started to do everything on the map 
we were able to explore so much and figure out  
so many secrets that existed in the game And this 
was only the first map And honestly I see Donkey  
Kong Bonanza as seriously becoming a game of the 
year competitor It is a ton of fun I of course  
uh beat Roger and had more bananas than him even 
though the demo shut off so we couldn't tell but  
I clearly won that So I hope you all enjoyed 
this hands-on experience that I had TLDDR:  
The Nintendo Switch 2 is a great system It feels 
extremely premium and all the games finally feel  
like they belong on the Switch And it's not 
embarrassing to say that my game doesn't run  
well anymore The games run perfectly fine now 
Overall I had a blast at the Nintendo Switch  
2 event and I'm looking forward to doing anything 
with Nintendo in the future So thank you Nintendo  
once again for inviting me out to this event I 
had a blast and shout out to my boy Roger for  
making this experience a lot of fun with all 
the competition Let me know who you think won  
in the comments below I'll see you guys in the 
next video that you should check out right over
