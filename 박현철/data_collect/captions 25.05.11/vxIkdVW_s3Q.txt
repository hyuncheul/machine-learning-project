like maybe Mario Kart playing in your
background you might want to switch the
background you know bet can you wait for

crazy game it's like I'm rolling it's me
like now you can't mix up who's which
character like when someone takes Yoshi

place that's
cute the webcam is TR is the Nintendo
switch 2 camera that is so wild avilable
on the same day as switch 2 launch it
all let's go a Nintendo switch online
membership will be required to use game
chat this makes sense however since we'd
like as many people as possible to
experience game chat will be available
without a membership fored time we hope
you'll try it
out additionally game chat supports the
Nintendo switch parental controls app
and different settings can be adjusted
what was the date that I just saw
parental permission is sorry I'm gonna
go back I'm gonna go back I'm gonna go
back
hold March 31st 2026 oh my God oh my God
we're going to get a launch date oh my
God it's going to happen when is the
launch oh my God oh my God when is the
launch oh my God
additionally supports the that's so bold
that they're like hey here's this end
date for like the online permission is
service but like we still don't know
when the console itself is coming oh my
God I love the anytime they anime Bowser
Jun and Bowser together family and
friends thank
you ah yes my favorite Clubhouse if you
just have one game you can pass a joycon
controller to a friend and play together
but on Nintendo switch 2 you can play
together locally on multiple systems
using just one game with game share as
shown here even games that require
multiple screens can be played if one
person owns a compatible game with game
share you can temporarily share
compatible games with others who also
have Nintendo switch 2 or a Nintendo
switch system it's like the GS with up
to three other systems at a
time interesting also supports online
play with other switch 2 systems and you
can use it with friends VI a game chat
which we showed
earlier game share can only be used with
compatible games this feature is planned
for several titles starting with a free
update for Clubhouse games 51 worldwide
Classics on Nintendo
switch okay more games for clubhous also
planned for select games exclusive to
Nintendo switch 2 so we hope you'll look
guys we're eating day one Nintendo
switch 2 Gang we're
eating the delay to show you the
Nintendo switch 2 system itself I was
like why was there not a
sound please take a look let's go bro
why is the audio not synced hey yes at
7.9 in switch 2 has a
bigger here's how that compares to
Nintendo gous dude Nintendo knows how to
do water let's just say it it's true
every time they always have they always
will approximately double the pixels
compared to switch you can enjoy games
in Greater detail on the 1080p screen
and what about on the console itself you
know what I'm saying like plug it in ooh
okay the screen supports up to 120
frames per second allowing for smoother
gameplay and supported titles wow wow
wow
wow the LCD screen is more Vivid and
supports HDR providing more contrast
between light and dark areas of the
images dang magnetic hey the allnew
joy-con 2 controllers connect
magnetically I did The Sound Don't wor
strong strong magnets keep the
controllers firmly attached to the
system yeah no crazy children can tear
that apart the release button on the
back that's right that's that's pretty
impressive actually the magnets are that
strong you have to be like okay magnets
calm down you have to like them Anda
them for greater comfort and control
when playing with a joyon 2 held horiz
good move good
call oh the left and right sticks are
now larger
nice oh Mouse
controls each joy-con 2 controller can
be used as a mouse play compatible games
both the left and right joycon 2 support
Mouse
controls that is so weird and
interesting by adjusting the audio
balance between the ranges sounds from
the built-in speakers are clearer and
more natural in handheld and tabletop
modes nice
crazy it has a built-in microphone so
you can voice chat with friends anytime
via game chat beautiful it also uses
noise caning technology to filter sound
so crazy there no cancelling technology
like okay we we're going all
in even if you don't have a surround
sound system games can be enjoyed with
more immersive three-dimensional sound
as if it were coming from all around you
o wow all
around what is that like that Dolby
thing that's so freaky in movie theaters
he if you know you
know Zelda I hear a horse Galloping on a
Nintendo console Zelda a large sturdy
stand get ready move it freely like this
oh
dang you can do the splits basically in
addition to the USBC Port found on the
bottom of the system there's one on top
as well wow USBC support it's handy for
connecting a USBC
camera or charging in tabletop
mode oh my God thank you wow wow wow wow
wow wow oh my God does that mean you can
use the webcam for your PC also gab of
internal storage eight times that of
Nintendo switch for storing your game
downloads save data and more thank you

generation for real oh my God Nintendo
congratulations you can play Nintendo
switch 2 games as well as compatible
Nintendo switch games physical and
digital games are supported yes love a
backwards compatible
console sorry it's just it's weird to
not hear the sound but see it you know
like where is it I want to hear the
co such a good new sound
as you just saw Nintendo switch 2 isn't
simply an improved Nintendo switch so
much more we redesigned the system from
the ground up and packed in lots of new
gameplay features like how are we going
to use the mouse bro show me a game that
uses the mouse Hardware or may we just
scroll the I
don't Mr
kaoto hello my current location is
actually inside the game
itself wait this is Nintendo switch 2
Welcome exclusive to Nintendo switch 2
what is this yes let's get some weird
like Nintendo Land kind of energy
yes are lot of question mark icons here
let's examine them yo if this is like
some wi U menu kind of
thing the joycon 2 controllers attach to
the system with magnets and those
magnets are inside the system okay cool
the SL and Sr buttons on the joycon 2
are made of
metal so that's how they attach to the
system okay that's cool a magnetic
circuit is formed between them so they
won't easily detach smart yep I was
going to say what if you just like
pulled it out one day but no through
examining signs like these you can
discover all sorts of secrets about
Nintendo switch 2 this is why Nintendo
is cool okay
guys little these little com with the
gyroscopes you can even do something
like
this you can adjust the position of the
golf club and aim for the cuff by
rotating the joycon
2 by combining the mouse controls and
gyroscopes things like this are
possible there we go there's the mous
controls even as you're playing mini
games and Tech demos oh cool some of the
secrets range from the unique features
of the system to Tiny details you might
not notice until they're pointed out
there are
plenty Nintendo switch 2 Welcome tour
will launch as a paid digital game on
the same day as Nintendo switch 2 so
please check it out if you're interested
digital only and paid now I'd like to
share some more information that's an
interesting choice
okay I'm surprised it's paid they should
just like I really thought it was going
to just be included because it's like
just show off what the console can do
day one like I'm kind of surprised by
that has much faster data reading
speeds next up is additional
storage switch 2 will only work with
micro SD Express
cards they're a different type of SD
card and will make high-speed data
transfers possible hey I'm respected in
that sense please note the regular micro
SD cards used for Nintendo switch will
not be compatible huh dang eliminating
that completely to transfer data switch
2 you can log into your Nintendo account
to use the system transfer feature with
this feature you can transfer save data
digital games and
more we're also releasing a new Pro
Controller is the old one
comp which launches game chat and on the
back there are new GL and gr buttons
which you can use to assign existing
button controls o okay that's nice
that's cool in addition an audio jack
has been added we've introduced a few
new features and after today's
presentation the official Nintendo
