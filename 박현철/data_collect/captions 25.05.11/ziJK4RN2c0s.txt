Um, I just hit live and I don't know if
it worked,
but Nintendo Direct today. I could be
yelling at
nobody. Can I get the ones and twos in
the chat,
please? If you guys can hear me.
I wanted to just go live without any
kind of like countdown splash
screen because one, I only have 15
minutes until this thing starts
[Music]
anyway. And
two, I hate when people go to rewatch
the stream later and it starts with like
a 10-minute countdown for the YouTuber
to show up.
I just wanted to even if it's a little
bit of me
going
Hello. Am I alone? It's better than a
countdown, you know. Um I see some ones
and twos over here in YouTube and
believe it or
not over on Twitch as
well. I know, Twitch. I
know. Don't get me
started. Good to see you guys in
here. Uh, give me one second. Uh, I
haven't streamed in a hot
minute. How do you do it? How does
streaming
work? Whether you're joining me here on
Twitch or YouTube, thank you so much for
being
here and uh wanting to watch the stream.
I YouTube man, you got to get your you
got to get your stuff together. It is a
a Nintendo Direct today. This might
actually blow some people away. This
might actually be a shock. Like if
you're not on That was so American.
Shock. What happened to me? If you
haven't been on the internet, which I
try not to as well to be
fair, Nintendo announced yesterday. Oh,
Jordan Fringe. Hello. I don't know why I
can't hear my
alerts. Um, I'm supposed to be able to.
I mean, obviously, right? It's just very
silent in here. I don't know where the
alerts are going or it doesn't really
matter cuz I'll have to turn them off
anyway in like uh 15 minutes, I guess.
But it'd be nice to have
him. Uh Nintendo tweeted yesterday that
they were doing a
direct a direct
today. Six days before the next
one. We have two directs in a week.
People, can I get Can I get a what in
chat? Can I get a
buzz? Can I get a in
chat? Because
what? I don't have we ever got two
direct like two full directs, not a
partner direct, not a mini
direct, two full hecking
directs. Now, there are rumors out there
all over the place of what we're seeing
today, but I do have in my possession,
believe it or not, the official Nintendo
Direct bingo sheet
uh for the March
27th direct. Are you ready for my
official bingo sheet?
So here it
is. Now I now chat I think we can get
bingo
here. There I think there are multiple
ways that we can get bingo here. So, as
you see here, we have uh Metroid, maybe
like maybe they'll show Metroid and then
and then all of this it it's actually
free space because just like in my
brain, just like in this the the the wet
floppy grooves of my
cranium. I have no idea what else could
possibly be at this thing. this lastm
minute Nintendo Switch one themed
direct. So, this is my
prediction. Um, if you think any of it
is wrong, you can let me you can sound
off in the chat and or comments if
you're watching this
later. Woods, why is there a direct this
close to Switch 2? All right, so to not
be I just I prefer to be goofy. I don't
know. I prefer to have fun with content
these
days. I used to be I I I think I used to
maybe at the start of my career at the
start of Switch One, I'd probably be
like, "So Nintendo are definitely doing
this direct so that they
can so that they can uh impress their
stock market shares." And I I'm
expecting to, you know, see some uh I
don't know. I feel like I would try to
be analy I'm just having fun
now. I'm just here for the ride at this
point.
If you want me to be serious, why are
they doing this
direct? I don't know. We're just in the
best timeline. I don't know what to tell
you. So, we're clearly in the final year
of the Switch. That is that is a fact.
Nintendo uh they've already revealed the
Switch 2 and in in six days they're
doing the Switch 2 Direct which
will seemingly uh you would think give
us a a deeper more expansive look at the
console, its features, both hardware and
software, launch games that it will
launch with, and then the launch date
which a lot of people are speculating
will be around June.
But before that, they decided to give us
a whole Nintendo Switch one direct with
things that are still coming to the
console. Now, little bit of history here
for
you. While I don't remember like
Nintendo doing any specific directs for
like the 3DS uh close to the Switch
launching, the Nintendo Direct concept
was very new at that time and it became
very popular during the Switch's
lifespan. But Nintendo supported the 3DS
very heavily into the Switch. Now, that
was a little bit because they were
hedging their bets, making sure the
Switch was going to be successful, but
they they supported it quite heavily.
They were releasing 3DS games well into
the first couple years of the Switch
releasing.
and the Switch One and the Switch 2
being in the same ecosystem and and
sharing backwards compatible games and
the Switch One being their bestselling
console of all time, it makes sense that
they don't want to just drop the console
and and support for it entirely, hedging
their bets on this new thing right off
the gate. It seems like they are doing
what they've done before and something
that's really awesome for them to do and
supporting the Switch One into the
Switches Switch 2's first year or two.
We don't know what that'll look like. We
know that Pokemon ZA is coming to the
Switch one. We know that Metroid Prime
is still coming to the Switch One. We
don't know if those are launch games for
the for the Switch 2 and cross
crossreleasing. We don't know if it
Metroid Prime literally comes holiday
season this year and it's still a Switch
One game. That is still a
possibility. I actually don't I actually
think the possibility of Metroid Prime
being a launch day game is pretty slim.
I don't think they would want to get too
much in the way of their Mario Kart
release, but I guess we'll see. But my
point is, and the point of this direct
is they're literally they probably
should have done it a little earlier. I
don't know why they're doing it so close
to the Switch 2, but the point is to
show you, hey, we're still supporting
the Switch One. Here's everything that's
coming in the next few months for the
Switch One, you
know. So, that's that's why I got to
blow my nose
um because I just woke
up. But I'm feeling pretty awake,
actually. I have my coffee, the
coffee. I took doggy for a little poop
walk, so she's good. She pooped. Anybody
wondering if my dog
[Music]
pooped? Kim was supposed to have an
OBGYn appointment today cuz she's very
pregnant, but we like going to those
together. We like doing all of that
stuff together. So when they announced
this uh direct yesterday, she had to
cancel her
appointment. So today um well move her
appointment. Today was supposed to be uh
Kim and I go to her
OBGYn, then I do the podcast, which is
good to mention this by the way, the
Nonintendo podcast. We are so close to
100,000 subscribers. It's my podcast
where I get to talk about everything
Nintendo and sometimes not. That's why
it's
Nintendo.
Also, world's largest Nintendo podcast.
That used to be true. I don't know if it
is anymore. We fell
off. My boy Logan Paul, remember the IGN
guy that I did a video with recently? He
took over the Nintendo IGN podcast, and
that one's technically number one. So,
my my boy my boy that happened a couple
weeks ago. My boy is my competition. We
were friends for like this long. No,
we're still friends. since we were
messaging yesterday. Um, what was I
saying? Oh, yeah. We're going to do OBJ
and then do the podcast. So, instead, we
moved her appointment to like, uh,
doesn't matter. You don't need to know.
We moved her appointment. Why are you
asking? Why are you so inquisitive?
You're going to try and find us at the
OBGYn. Calm
down. So, we moved her appointment and
today I'm going to be doing
this stream reaction, which starts in 5
minutes. Then I'm going to do my typical
endstream film an actual reaction video
quickly edit it and throw it up. So if
you wouldn't mind watching that after
this, that would be great. Then I'm
going to set up and do my podcast. So
slammed today. And if you could please
uh watch the video, watch the stream,
and watch the podcast. I know I'm asking
a lot. I know I'm asking a lot. a lot of
content for what is probably a 10-minute
direct. Right.
Right. But help a boy
out. You know what I mean? I do so much
and I ask for so
[Music]
little. Guys, thank you so much again
for being here. Um, we only have a few
minutes left. I I feel like there's not
many things to speculate on here. I
honestly have smooth brain. Uh I have no
real thoughts on this event. I'm really
just along for the ride. Like to be even
more honest, I'm so checked out on
Switch One. Like I love it. I love
Switch One. And I hope there's some fun
stuff in here, but I'm so checked out
and just ready for Switch 2. Like my
brain is in new console Mario Kart mode,
you know? So like this is bonus round. I
have never been so
um unexpecting of a direct. I've never
had my hopes so nowhere in the best way
because like this is just a surprise, a
bonus. We had no idea till yesterday. No
one expected it. We're all waiting for
Switch 2 literally next week. And and if
this thing sucks, it's almost like,
okay, see you in 6 days, Nintendo, for
the good one. Thanks. Thanks for giving
me something to watch this morning. You
know what I mean? Like zero
expectations. We can really only go up
because if we if if nothing happens,
that's what I expected. I'm fine. You
know, there has never been such little
pressure on a direct.
You know, like, you know, like when when
a family has four kids and there's so
much pressure on the first three, but by
the time they get to the fourth one, he
gets just like the skate by easy route.
He's the fourth one. They know he's the
last one. So, they're cherishing every
moment cuz this will never happen
again. He gets all the handme-downs. He
gets all the fun toys plus new stuff
that he's bought. You know, he's the
favorite is what I'm saying. Zero
expectations. The other three, they have
to be lawyers and doctors. The fourth
kid, he could literally work at Burger
King and his parents would just be happy
he's there. That's this direct for
us. The last one, the last Switch One
direct. Why you got to describe my
childhood? Sorry about that. Uh, last
last thing I'll say, we got four minutes
now. Um, thank you everybody for being
here. I saw a lot of uh uh uh subs and
and and and member and YouTube and
Twitch support in that way. And I see
Monado Max in here with a $10 as well
and super chat. Love you, Monado. Thank
you everybody. I I didn't the alerts
didn't pop, but also I just kind of had
to ramble for the first 15 minutes. I
didn't have a ton of time, so I couldn't
thank everybody. But one big
amalgamation. Thank you so much. And I
want to I want to I'll use this little
window here to
announce. I didn't know how I was going
to do it. I might do it better later. I
am going to come back to streaming. I
know I say that all the time with the
Switch 2. There's been a lot of things
going on and I want to talk about that
later. Reasons why I couldn't stream. It
really all just boils down to Kim's
pregnant and priorities massively
shifted and planning massively shifted
and life goals massively shifted and I I
just couldn't while Kim is immensely
pregnant I couldn't justify sitting here
for hours multiple times a week you know
like I just kind of felt like I had to
be on ball I had to be ready for
anything and uh so I just shifted
priorities but with Mario Kart I'm
planning a big return Mario Kart stream
That's all I'm gonna say. But when
Switch 2
launches, baby providing, you know, like
if the baby if the baby comes the day
before the Switch 2, things might things
might get shifted around, but that is my
plan. My plan is to come back to
streaming with Mario Kart and we have
big things planned. Okay. All
right. And that'll that'll be on Twitch.
It'll be on Twitch. I I and YouTube to
I'll do the like I'm doing now. This is
the thing people do now. Have you seen
Have you seen Everyone's like co-
streaming. All right, we have two
minutes
left.
Uh, let me let me shuffle. Let me
shuffle and and buff. Let me turn this
music off, too, cuz we don't need that.
It's going to be dead silent for it's
going to be awkward for a second.
Uh, it's so it's so hard to not be in
this position and do a Mario impression
of here we
go. When will the direct begin?
Literally now. Literally any minute now.
Zero expectations, zero wants, needs, or
desires. Along for the ride. No idea how
long it is. They haven't 30 minutes. Oh,
never mind. It's 30
minutes. We're locked in for 30 minutes.
I I assume this would be like 10 minutes
long. Actually, I got to move it. It's
not in a good spot for me.
Sorry. Oh my god. Please hurry
up. I was yelling at myself, not you
guys. There we go. That's good. That's
good. That's cozy. I didn't want to be
looking off to the side. All right. 30
minutes. I might even take this time to
blow my nose one more time. And the best
part about having no music is that
you'll hear you'll hear it. You'll hear
it loud and clear. Sam Simps and Galls,
thank
you. Oh, it's starting. Sorry, I'm still
blowing my
nose. Let me know if you can hear it.

remastered HD graphics and enhanced
gameplay. Set in the capital city in the
year Tyson 20, Lido Kusanoha makes his
living as an apprentice detective. But
unbeknownst to others, he also fights
alongside demons as a devil summoner. To
protect the capital, Ryo
must look like Persona natural cases.
Fight in real time battles alongside
demons you summon. Oh, this doesn't look
actually this looks better than I
thought. To strike an enemy's weak
point, then follow up with a powerful
attack. It looks very Persona actually
like a real time persona. Turn opposing
demons into allies. Yeah, demons can
also be useful outside of battle. That
is this is Persona. powers. This is

begins. As Puck guides you on your
journey, you'll delve deeper into the
expansive
world by examining your surroundings.
Move my face shift and combine with Puck
to explore areas you couldn't reach
before. But tread lightly. The creatures
inhabiting this world will prove
hostile. Is that better? When facing
imposing enemies, you and Puff can
temporarily fuse into the Gaia form to
unleash powerful attacks. I assume you
want me off the game titles, that's why.
By consuming your prey, you'll collect
resources that can then be used to
enhance your abilities.
Yeah, sorry. This is the Pac-Man. I've
seen this, but yeah, this is like the
weird Pac-Man game.

I actually didn't I actually didn't know
if we'd get more Metroid
today. Oh my
god. Hell yeah. The music, the
atmosphere. Shut up, Wood.
Here, Samus finds a verdant jungle with
a colossal tree at its center.
In order to survive and escape this
planet that she was unexpectedly
transported to, Samus must scan stone
figures and other relics to carve a
path. It's so much like the first game.
[Music]
It's so This is not He's not alone
though. This is not Switch One graphics.
Alien creatures living in the jungle are
waiting to strike.
Chat, is this Switch One graphics? It's
too clean. This was definitely recorded
on a Switch 2. Come
on. If this is Switch One, that's really
impressive. It's No way. No shot. This
is Switch One gameplay. It's too good.
As she explores the planet, it's too
clean. Samus is granted mysterious and
ancient
powers. psychic
abilities.
Ooh. These powers allow Samus to operate
mechanisms and to open doors. Open
doors. They also allow her to control
the trajectory of her being. Oh, that's
sick. With the power of her mind. Oh,
that's sick. This game is sick. But why
were these powers bestowed upon Sam?
Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm so I can't believe
we're getting a full look at
Metroid. Oh, this is so good.
[Music]
Nah, this ain't no Switch one. Piss the
hell out of here. This is switch two for
sure.
I can't believe it. Will be her fate
after being summoned to views. Honestly,

more games didn't look like
this coming 2025.
We already knew about coming this year.
Oh, it looks so
good. Oh, is that a black and red?
Ooh. Ooh.
Oh.
Oh, like Iron Man. It looks like even
more challenges await Samus.
We hope you're looking forward to
exploring with Samus' new psychic
abilities.
Okay, let's move on to No. Why? Just how
is that not the final thing? Wait,
chat. What's the one more thing if
they've already done Metroid gameplay?
Once upon a time, there was a drab
coffee shop. What's the one more thing
into a magical potion cafe? As the
newest potionista of the cursed cafe,
you'll craft for Disney villains and get
to know them in a new light. Mix

attention to this. I'm still thinking
about what we just saw. Serve them to
your villainous visitors, including
Ursula. And wait, are they ripping off
the coffee game? You can upgrade your
ingredients to produce some wildly
wicked creations. Are they ripping off
the coffee game and putting in Disney
each customer storylines leading to
different outcomes every time? What's

original items.
Plus, up to four players can make magic
together in online co-op. That's a lot
of twos over on YouTube as well. Explore
this whimsical world on the road to
graduation and beyond. All right,
another cozy game. I like the odds. for
a spellbinding journey. I probably want
to play this though to be to be honest.
I just got to be honest. The moment

Nintendo Switch this holiday. It looked
fine though.
Action, adventure, and arcade games

You can catch Pokemon here.
It really is their best work, but they
might be hostile if you sense trouble,
which is sad to safety, but there are
Pokémon that live outside Wild Zones,
too. I feel like they really tried. You
know, some of them can even be found on
rooftops in some areas. People and
Pokémon live easygoing lives. I just
don't know why they did that to the
buildings.
But when
nightfalls, the city's aura transforms.
Highly skilled trainers are invited to
participate in a
tournament. The ZA Royale.
Oh, that's what that was. Battle zones.
Oh, at night you battle. Only at night.
If you're spotted, they'll challenge you
to battle.
Strike first before being seen, and
you'll land a surprise
attack. During battles, using a super
effective move at the right moment is
key. And with Mega Evolution, some
Pokemon can power up even more.
The battling looks cool. I mean, I've
never denied that. Rank Z and work your
way up to rank A. Oh, I like the ranking
system. Oh, and Z to A. Reach the top
are said to have a wish granted.
A wish. The wish. Wait, a wish granted?
Like a genie situation.
Day and night are two sides to Lumio
City. It seems there are even more
secrets waiting to be uncovered. What
will you find on your
adventure? Pokemon Legends ZA launches
on Nintendo Switch later this year. For
some reason, my brain was thinking later
this day when he said that, and I was
like, "Oh." Where the game is set, the
aura transforms between day and night.
It seems there are even more secrets to
uncover. Please be on the lookout for
more information. Hate the idea. I don't
hate what they're doing. I I I like the
idea of the game. I just wish it looked
better. I'm sure it'll be fun, you know.
Hello there.
The game you're about to
see doesn't have a big epic
story, but what it does have is lots of
funny little rhythm games.
You want to see?
I kind of do. Yeah. Just press the
button to jump through the ringoop.
[Music]
I'm kind of all about this right now.
This game is everything right now.
It sounds easy.
This is everything. Is super tricky.
What is this?
Maybe you could try it in time to a
rhythm.
[Music]
Rhythm Heaven. In this game, you might
do almost anything, but you'll need to
do it in rhythm. You think it's rhythm
heaven? Probably. I never played one.
With practice, you might even be able to
play it with your eyes closed.
[Music]
Hell yeah.
Get into the rhythm with a brand new
entry in the Rhythm Heaven series. Yeah,
you called it, chat.
Rhythm Heaven Groove. Man, they're
bringing back
everything. 2026.
That was Rhythm Heaven Groove. Okay,
cool. A brand new entry in the Rhythm
Heaven series.
It includes lots of music produced by
renowned Japanese musicians Tunku.
[Music]
What kinds of rhythms do you think
you'll hear? I don't know. You're
looking forward to it. I'm I don't know.
I like the muscle guy. Next, we have
news about the use of digital games on
your system.
Please take a look.
All right.
With game cards, you can put a game
featuring Mario in this Nintendo Switch
system and a Legend of Zelda game in
this one. Mhm. Freely inserting the
games you have on hand into any system
you want. Yeah. But what if digital
games could be as flexible and
convenient as game cards? Wait, what?
Here's what we came up with. What?
Introducing the virtual game
card. In the future, virtual game cards
can be used for digital games.
Wait, what? I'm confused.
[Music]
What?
When purchasing the digital version of a
game, it will be loaded onto your system
as a virtual game card. Okay. Allowing
you to play that title. Okay.
Your digital games will be lined up as
virtual game cards on a dedicated
management screen. Uh, okay. Here you
can load and eject your virtual game
cards and manage which games you can
play on your system. I'm confused.
I'm I'm not getting it. I'm I'm getting
it. But what's the difference? This part
is the difference. If you have two
Nintendo Switch systems, Yeah. you can
eject a virtual game card from one and
load it onto the second. Uhhuh. Uh-huh.
Now you can play this game on the second
system wherever and whenever you want,
just as if you had inserted a physical
game card. Can you already do that? With
virtual game cards, you can freely load
and arrange which games you play on up
to two systems.
I don't get it. Local communication with
your second system is required, but only
the first time.
So, you can also lend out virtual game
cards to your Nintendo account family
group members. I'm too dumb. Connect to
your family group member system via
local wireless when you want to lend a
game. Choose the title you're
lending and who you're lending it to.
Oh, so you can lend games.
That's okay. That I get. That's cool.
They can now play on their own system.
So it doesn't have to be the same
account. You can only lend one game at a
time to a particular person. Oh, that's
part that part I get. After which they
will automatically return to you,
making digital games even easier to use.
That's awesome. Virtual game card. That
part is awesome.
So, okay. The virtual game card feature
lets you swap games between Nintendo
Switch systems as well as to Nintendo
Switch 2 systems.
This feature is planned to be added via
a system in late April. It's very
confusing. Let's take a look at more
Nintendo Switch games. So, you can lend
game you can lend your digital games to
[Music]
friends for 2 weeks. They can play a
game you bought digitally is essentially
what I got out of
that. Oh, that game's coming to Switch.
That's
random. This game looks really
interesting. This Star Overdrive, it
looks like Breath of the Wild on a
hoverboard. Only 14 days. No, I that's
good. As long you can come you can give
it to them again as long as you come
back in contact. It's just so that you
can't just give a game to somebody and
they have it
forever. The 14 days is huge. That's
like a long time in my opinion cuz you
can see them again in 2
[Music]
weeks. I That's huge chat. That's
awesome. Trust me, it's awesome. But
why? So to encourage you to buy digital
games because you can use them like a
physical
game. You can easily put a digital game
into one of your other switches or give
it to somebody else. It encourages
digital purchases. Remaster of Saga it's
good. Trust me.
Trust me the Royal Air and Will the
Explorer but it's only family members
who add a family member to your account.
I don't know what to tell you.

chat. Nintendo doesn't know if it's
actually your family. Just add a friend

They're not going to they're not going
to blood check

Saga Frontier 2 Remastered launches on
Nintendo Switch later
[Music]
today. Monumental adventures await.
Embark on peaceful journeys. Can we lock
in a series of beautiful places? Can we
lock in? Wander through isometric worlds
filled with stunning landscapes to
manipulate, optical illusions to
discover, and mystifying secrets to
uncover. It's almost over. In Monument
Valley, lead the silent princess Ida in
her quest for forgiveness while
outsmarting the enigmatic Crow people.
A different journey awaits in Monument
Valley 2. Guide Ro in her adventure
through motherhood as she and her child
unlock the secrets of the sacred
geometry. Both games contain all their
additional chapters, add-ons, and DLC.
The first two
monument on Nintendo Switch April 15th.
Pre-orders begin later today. It's got
to be something big, I feel like.
and help Nure on her journey to restore
the world's light in Monument Valley 3,
setting sail on Nintendo Switch this
summer. This summer. Are we
[Music]
there? A brand new entry in the
Everybody's Golf Series is driving on
Nintendo Switch.
Aim. Time your button. Press just right
and take your shot. Nice shot. Nice
shot.
[Music]
Spins and other special shots. Oh, cool.
Ding. In the single player challenge
mode. Compete in tournaments and face
off against a range of rivals to become

golfer. In wacky golf, your shots could
get pulled into holes or obstacles might
fall. It's golf that's not quite par for
the course. Up to four golfers can hit
the fairway together locally or in
online play. I've heard I've heard it's
fun. So, just relax and get ready to I'm
not super in a golf. Everybody's golf
Hot Shots lands on Nintendo Switch this
year. A lot of this year's not a lot of
release dates.
Ooh.
Unite some of Marvel's greatest
superheroes in the fight against evil.
Marvel Rivals coming. two heroes from
the roster of 15, including the likes of
the spectacular Spider-Man and the
ferocious Wolverine to take on the
challenge. From close quarters
combatants to aerial aces, you can mix
and match a variety of heroes for an
amazing array of
possibilities and swap between your
team. Oh, that's Spider-Man from Marvel
Rivals. Take advantage of your team
strength. Oh, and I saw Venom from
Marvel Rivals as well. Plus, up to four
players can assemble for local or online
co-op play.
That's cool that they got some Marvel
Rivals characters for the fate of the
Marvel universe begins when Marvel
Cosmic Invasion launches on the Nintendo
Switch system this holiday. Yeah, it's
cool. They got some uh Marvel rival
characters in there like Marvel Cosmic
Invasion where you'll battle as a tag
team of different superheroes.
A new Marvel beat up. Please take a
look.
Silk song.
Wind Waker. Immediately the ocean. I
like almost pissed and it I had to
control myself. I'm a bubble tornado.
Ah, Tamodachi life. What is this? Did I
get it? Is that it?
How refreshing.
A lot of people are going to go crazy
for this. It's not I don't have the
nostalgia, but I feel like I'm gonna
have fun with
this. It's definitely not Silk Song or
Wind Waker.
[Music]
Like living the dream.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 2026 coming to
Switch One too. That's so
interesting. Looks like
Kim. Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Did you want to talk?
A
glad that was only a dream.
That's cool. That's cute. That was
Tomachi. That's the one more thing. The
first new entry in the series in over 10
years. For a lot of people, that's huge.
I'm sure. In the trailer, we saw me
characters living on an island out at
sea. It would be good if that was this
year. What kinds of interactions do you
think they'll have? It's like Animal
Crossing Tomodachi. On an island.
Thank you for watching today's Nintendo
Direct. So far so far. It's over. You
said our final announcement is something
a little different that's not a game.
Here's Mr. Miiamoto to introduce Oh, is
is it the Zelda movie? Hello, I'm Shaged
Miiamoto. Thank you for watching today's
Nintendo maybe the park or the store
Nintendo Direct has delivered Nintendo
news directly to you. Uhhuh. And now
these presentations have grown into an
event that many people watch.
Thank you all very much. I'm I'm
actually getting scared. We'll continue
to broadcast Nintendo Direct
presentations, but we're also launching
a new channel based on the concept of
delivering information to you directly.
Okay.
This is a smart device app called
Nintendo today. Okay.
How much news you got? Calendar. In the
app, you can view different Nintendo
events. We will also be delivering all
sorts of content about Nintendo games
and characters every day.
Okay,
after the Nintendo Direct for Nintendo
Switch 2 on April 2nd, so it's like
Twitter but just Nintendo. News about
Nintendo Switch 2 will be delivered to
you daily and directly through the
Nintendo Today app as well. Okay. All
right. I mean, Nintendo Today will be
available to download on smart devices
later today. I will have to download
that then. I guess anyone with a
Nintendo account can use the app, so
please try it out.
Okay. I mean, that's all I have to
share. I could also hope you enjoy using
Nintendo today.
Well, I guess I don't have to check
Twitter for them anymore. I can just
check their app. That's all for today's
Nintendo Direct. All right, cool. Thank
you for watching.
Not what I
expected. Um, all right. Look, I said
going into it, I said going into it, I
had zero expectations.
We got a lot out of this considering I
had zero expectations. Now, some of it
wasn't for me. A lot of the remakes and
JRPGs and stuff like that. I the
obviously the three big things is a new
Tamadachi Life. Uh this I need someone
to explain this to me like I'm five. I
might even have to watch it again
because I really wasn't getting it. And
then I also kind of want to watch the
Metroid part again too because I am
convinced that Switch 2 footage. But
let's let's start here and let's see if
we can decode this. Now we're all very
smart people here on the beat them up
community. You know, big brains. I know
a lot of people in chat have their PhDs,
their masters. So I believe we can get
to the bottom of this. the game in this
one. Freely inserting the games you have
on hand into any system you
want. Yes. Yes. Yes. So, we can do that
digitally now with any system that you
have. That's cool. That's cool. That's
cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.
Cool. Cool. But if you put your account
What would happen? What? Correct me if
I'm wrong. I'm not even saying anything.
What would happen, chat, if you had two
Switches, you had an account logged into
both the same account? Are you not able
to just download the same game on both
consoles? Is that not something you can
already do? Can I get a one in chat if
that's something you can just already
do? I'm not sure why I'm making the
distinction that it's a digital
switch one. Yeah, you can definitely
already do that. And then it it it lets
you play on
both possibly. You have the only the
only thing I can think of
is you can now only have one game on one
console at a time. Wait, so is this act
Wait, so is this actually taking away
something? Is this actually
limiting? Is this actually limiting how
many games you can have on a console at
a time if you
have I don't want to overthink it, but
before you could just have it on both.
Now, if it's a digital game
cartridge and you can only have it on
one at a time, is that technically more
restricting? It's more restrictive, but
marketed to sound
great. Yes. This is
limiting. I don't want to I don't want
to get too upset or angry because I
don't know. I don't know if we're right.
But that is what it sounds
like. Which is why I was getting
confused cuz I was like, can't you
already do that? Now, the only thing I
can think of here is I don't know if
you've ever tried playing a second
switch, but if you don't have Wi-Fi,
like if you're playing a second Switch
on a plane or something, it'll often pop
a proxy saying this is not like the main
account, please connect to Wi-Fi. And
it'll be kind of a pain to actually play
that game. You'll have to hit like
cancel a bunch of times and like try and
open it. And like sometimes it like
doesn't want to open it cuz you're not
on Wi-Fi.
So maybe this will like prevent that. So
now as long as the digital card game is
allocated to the Switch, it'll play no
matter
what. They explained it bad. Read chat
for God's sake. I'm literally reading
chat. Chat, there is 9,000 people in
here spamming different
opinions. Literally reading chat, my
guy. Doing my best. All right, let's
keep watching it.
But what if digital games could be as
flexible and convenient as game cards?
Well, they're saying more flexible and
convenient, so it can't be limiting. I
just can't believe that wordage makes it
more
limiting. This is to share with other
consoles. Yes, but right now they're
specifically talking about within your
own consoles.
Well, here's what we came up with.
Introducing the virtual game
card. In the future, virtual game cards
can be used for digital
[Music]
games. When purchasing the digital
version of a game, it will be loaded
onto your system as a virtual game card.
Okay. So, before when you bought a
digital game, it loaded a digital game.
Now, it's saying it's going to load a
digital game card. Distinction
allowing you to play that title.
Essentially, so far the same thing.
You're just calling it something
different. Any user registered to the
system can play the game.
I believe that was already the way you
would download a digital game and then
any user on the system could play the
game. Yes, that is correct. I am correct
because I do that all the
time. So, nothing is nothing is
different so far. Digital games will be
lined up as virtual game cards on a
dedicated management screen. Okay, that
is weird. But it's I guess now it's
separating digital games and physical
games. So, and if you want to find just
the digital ones and these virtual game
cards, they have a specific spot.
Now, this is a big change to the to the
UI and the way that it works. Here, you
can load and eject your virtual game
cards and manage which games you can
play on your system.
So, there'd be no reason to ever eject
one unless you want to move it, right?
Surely you could have all of these
loaded at once. You don't have to like
you don't have to like oh I want to play
Tears of the Like if you have one
Switch, you wouldn't have to eject Tears
of the Kingdom digitally to play another
game digitally, you know, on the same
console. Surely they're just all loaded.
This is if you want to take it out of
the system and put it somewhere else,
you can eject it. Surely. Which games
you can play on your system?
[Music]
If you have two Nintendo Switch systems,
you can eject a virtual game card from
one and load it onto the
second. So if you if us alone, no family
yet, have two systems, you can eject it
for one and put it on the other. So now
you can't play it on the first one. you
can only play it on the second one,
right? Because you've ejected it. It's
it's it's a physical digital now. So,
just like an actual physical car, you
wouldn't be able to play two places at
once. So, you can only play it on the
first one.
Before chat, if you had two switches,
you could just download the game twice
on both and play it on both.
So once again, I ask
you one in chat if you think this has
limited where you can play the game now
and two if you think it's the same as
before. Just so
I'm okay. So Twitch chat is spamming
one.
Uh so that does it does seem like we're
on the same page with that.
Okay. And now YouTube is pretty much
spamming one. There's a lot of twos in
there, too. Why are the twos
trolling? Or if you're putting two in
chat, can you put two again, but like
attach your
reason? That's only with different
saves. Well, this doesn't talk about
saves. This mentions nothing about
saves. As far as we know, the save
situation works exactly the same way as
before. You could not play at the same
time. You can't play a game at the same
time. Wait, wait, wait, wait. This is so
confusing.
Yes, chat. I I see your point. I I see
the two people point. So that the people
spamming twos, this is their
point. If you before, if you put them
both on the same console, and we never
talked about this, but it's a good
point. You couldn't actually load up
both games at the same time and play
both concurrently because if you were
connected to Wi-Fi on both, it would
know you're trying to play two at once.
Is that your point? Now, I've never
tried that, but assuming that's your
point,
um, taken into consideration for
sure. You are forgetting about primary
console registry. No, I'm not. I
mentioned that. I mentioned that. This
is so confusing,
chat. Bear with me here. Bear with me
here. You could do
that. I guess if one was offline, you
could for sure. If it was offline, you
could. All right. I
don't Oh
god, you would never. All right, let's
follow that thread quickly, though. You
can't play both at the same time. What
you're not going to do that though
because you're just one person. They've
just created a step now where you have
to manually eject and then inject where
before you could just load it up on
either one. You would never actually
play both at the same time, but they
would both be on the consoles at the
same time, making it a little easier.
Can you test it? I could, but let's God.
All right, Bob's in chat. On a second
console, it would always check the
internet. Yeah, I talked about this.
Every time you played a digital game, I
guess this fixes that, but that's about
all it fixes. Yeah, Bob, I mentioned
that. So, yeah, it would do that, but
you could still force it to play
it, right? Like I've been in situations
like on a plane where it's like this
isn't the main account, but eventually
I've just like forced my way in and it
like it lets you play. Or is there no
way of doing it
sometimes? I guess yes, I guess this
does 100%. I mean, that issue is
annoying when it happens, even if
there's a way around it. So, this does
fix the second switch, the non- primary
switch issue of being able to play a
game on a second non-primary switch that
you
own without any issues. That is the one
major benefit of of doing this.
I will
say that it seems to me like the better
solution to that would be if Nintendo
just allowed you to play your games on
any Switch that's logged into your
account without the primary Switch bull
crap.
This seems like a workaround so that
they can still have the primary switch
bull crap and force you to eject and
reingject and do all of this
stuff. You know what I mean? But it does
fix the issue that they
created. Getting my head around this is
is baffling me how hard it is. And I
don't know if I'm dumb or if it's just
really Can I get in all honesty, can I
get a one in chat if this is confusing
and a two in chat if I'm overthinking
it? Be honest. You can be
honest. Bob, if you've got anything else
to give me here, chat is literally
saying ask Bob. I would love I would
love the feedback. I'm gonna keep going.
There's a lot of ones and some twos. I
will take the ones. Let's keep going
though. The the confusing part is how is
it different for the single user than
before? You know,
now you can play this game on the second
system where an internet connection is
required only when loading and or
ejecting. So yes, that little blur. So,
okay, here's something that made this a
little bit more confusing is a lot of
the key information is in little blurbs
in the corner that answers a lot of my
questions and I didn't I couldn't read
those when the direct was moving so
quickly and someone was talking. So,
yes, no internet connection is required
to play the game once it's loaded. So,
that 100% does fix the issue of being on
a plane and then having no internet and
the Switch being like, "This isn't your
primary Switch. Please connect to the
internet to play this game. So, as long
as you've preloaded it on, you're good
to
go. Again, it's fixing an issue that
Nintendo has created with a weird
primary account system. But it does fix
the issue wherever and whenever you
want, just as if you had inserted a
physical game
card. With virtual game cards, you can
freely load and arrange which games you
play on up to two systems.
I get this 100%. I'm just trying to
figure out
why if you if you had two switches, and
I have a lot, why you would want these
games here and these games
here. I guess it's just cool that you
can do it.
You could do it before, but the whole
primary account thing was annoying
because you had to kind of work around
that. So, this just makes it so you can
have two
switches.
Um, okay. So, as long as like cloud
cloud saves are a thing, right? So, you
play one switch
here, but then it's not like you can
have one switch at like your grandma's
house and one switch at home and then go
to grandma's and pick up where you left
off. You will still have to bring your
Switch so you can connect them and trade
the game. Otherwise, when you leave
grandma's house, you won't have the
games that are on that Switch. You will
physically have to go back and get that
Switch if you want to get the games off
of it. whereas before it was only
digital and you could just download to
your Switch, make that the primary
account and then play the games. This is
so strange. It's like it fixes some
issues, but it's limiting in other
ways. Just watch the video. Watch I am
literally watching the video. I'm
breaking it down piece by piece every
time they introduce a new piece of
information so that we don't get too far
past the last thing they said. I'm
literally watching the video and trying
to understand
it. Local communication with your second
system is required, but only the first
time. Good thing I kept watching the
video.
That was a devastating
unpause. That was a devastating unpause
for
me, but only the first time.
All right.
So, how do you unload a
game? No, it still it still raises more
questions. Only the first time so you
can switch freely between them without
connecting them. But if you don't have
if you don't have access to one of them,
you still won't be able to eject that
game unless you call grandma and you're
like, "Hey, grandma, can you can you
eject the game from that switch so that
I can re unless you
can remotely eject a game from another
switch. Unless you can load up this
white switch and say, "Hey, eject it
from this one so I can put it in this
one.
[Music]
Okay, for everyone saying your grandma
will need Wi-Fi. True. She will for
everybody saying keep watching the
video. That's We're done now with that
first with that first how it works with
yourself. And I still have questions. So
glad we kept watching. Now we lean into
this family group member. Up to eight
Nintendo account users can connect
together in a family group.
Okay. So, lending to family. Now, again,
I want to stress you don't need hair
samples. You don't need to spit in a
tube. You don't need to draw blood to
prove that your family. You just need to
add somebody to your family account. So,
you can add seven friends. You know, you
can add friends to your account. It
actually honestly is a good deal if you
do cuz you will save money. But anyway,
let's keep You can also lend out virtual
game cards to your Nintendo account
family group members. So this I mean
this theoretically works the same way as
before. It's just while they're playing
the game because now you're introducing
another person into the mix. So while
they're actively playing the game
they're borrow they're borrowing you
can't really like take it back from them
or else they won't be able to play it.
So they will just have the game until
they're ready to be done with it. But
that's how a physical game works. This
is cool. This I'm like way more
interested in because even though you're
on the same family plan, it's still
different user accounts borrowing the
same digital game. That's really cool. I
actually really like that. Connect to
your family group member system via
local wireless when you want to lend a
game. Choose the title you're
lending and who you're lending it to.
And you're done. They can now play on
their own system.
You can only lend one game at a time to
a particular person. Makes sense. Games
can be lent out for two weeks after
which they will automatically return to
you. Now, that's good. I like that. You
know, it's it's your family, right?
Friends, whatever. Supposedly somebody
that you will see more than once every
couple of weeks, so they can have it for
longer. It's just this is just
preventing you from like
selling it to somebody and then they
have it forever, you know, like this is
uh it's good. This good this this
fine. Save data will not be erased when
returning virtual game cards. Okay,
good. Making digital games even easier
to use. Virtual game card.
Yeah, I I still I still have
questions. They And they can't steal
your game. Yeah,
exactly.
Um, it's the free family account, not
the Nintendo Switch family plan. Oh,
wait, really? Oh. Oh, that's even better
then. It's all free. You just add people
to
your family account. I I don't know how
that works, to be honest. Just buy
grandma a physical copy.
Uh, so can I not play it while they have
it? Can we get the game back early? Can
I give it back to them after? Can we
swip
swap? Bob, those are a lot of really
good questions. Um, those are things
they just didn't talk about. So, I'm not
like as confused with those things.
Those are just a lot of like whatifs.
But I I think to answer your question,
Bob, if I may, can you not play it while
they have it? No. You have literally
lent it to them. What it's done is it's
turned digital games into physical
games. They are physical games now. You
can't touch them, but they work the same
way. So, if Bob, I was to give you my
copy of Breath of the Wild physical and
you took it to your house for 2 weeks, I
literally physically cannot play that.
That's what they've
done. Now, that's that's cool. I That's
cool cuz if I'm done with the game and
you want to borrow it, sure. And you
couldn't do that before with digital.
You can't give somebody a digital game
to play for two weeks while you don't
have it. That's not a thing you can do
before. So that is cool. Even though I
can't play it, that is cool. You can do
that. If I buy it digitally, a a friend
or family member close to me doesn't
also have to buy it. If they want to
play it, they can just borrow
mine. Can we get the game back early? I
would assume so. I would assume that
they can reject it if if they're done.
If they don't want it, they can eject it
from their system and then once we're
both connected to Wi-Fi, it will ping
back to
me. Um, can I give it back to them after
that? They didn't say. I am also
assuming yes. I'm assuming it's like a
uh it's just two weeks so they can't
steal it or leave with it. But if you
want to refresh the two weeks, I would
say yes. But maybe not. Maybe they
don't. Maybe they don't want that. I
would say yes, probably though. I doubt
they're going to be that nitpicky with
it. Can we swip swap as in they give you
a game? I don't see why not. We're all
on the same family plan, right? I don't
see any reason why they can't give
me, right? Like, we're all on the same
family plan. It's not like I'm like the
leader of the family and only I can give
games. Only I can be the giver of games,
right? Surely they can give me games. I
can give their games. just one at a time
would be my assumption. Again, just
assumptions. Those are like fairly easy
to like either assume it's a yes or no
answer. What really confuses me, I guess
the main thing that like not confuses
me, I want to stress, I understand how
this
works, what I'm trying to figure out and
what I'm debating is whether or not for
a single person this is actually better
than the way it was before. And the only
thing that I can see is is on like
immediately on paper better is the
primary account issue. You can avoid
that here by lending a game to yourself
and it just it voids the primary account
issue. My thing is though that's an
issue that Nintendo caused by creating
the primary account issue and they
haven't fixed that issue. They've just
found a workaround. And does that
workaround technically make it more
complicated and limited when it comes to
installing multiple games on multiple
systems that you own? And as far as I
can see, the answer is yes. I think as
as Tang in chat just
said, Jesus
um I think for single it is worse, but
for family it's better. I think it has
pros and cons and I definitely think
it's more
convoluted. I don't love the idea of
like needing to eject or or insert my
digital
games for when it's just
me. So,
um yeah, read the little bottom text at
the end. at the
end. Uh
uh digital games even easier to use
virtual by navigating to settings online
licenses settings and turning settings
on. You can in there's a red line in the
way. You can instead opt to connect to
the internet startup to start up
software by navigating to user settings
online license settings and turning on.
You can instead opt to connect to
internet to start up software. What does
that mean?
You can instead opt to connect to the
internet to start up software. What does
that
mean? Does that does that void the whole
thing? Is that saying you don't have to
do
this? What does that mean? And then it
works the old
way. Hold on, let
me Here we go. Now we can read it
better. By navigating to user settings,
online license settings, and turning the
setting
on, you can instead opt to connect to
the internet to start up software.
You can just old way. Oh, well then
we're
fine. Then we're good.
This entire virtual game cart system is
just a virtual representation of the old
system. It's exactly the
same. Oh, I don't I think I know what
you're saying. I don't know if I would
say exactly the same cuz you couldn't
rent out games to family members
before, could you?
This is so
confusing. So you don't So you don't
have to do any of this. Is that what
this is saying? Are we sure on that?
This just makes it the old
way. Then what's the
point? Then what's the point in any of
it?
Seems like you have the option now to
lend a game and not require internet.
All right. If that's the one thing that
we're gaining from
this,
good. My brother and I are signed into
each other's switches to share games.
When he plays, I can't use his games.
This fixes the problem. This is why My
brother and I are signed into each
other's switches to share games. When he
plays, I can't use his games. This fixes
the problem. Um, I don't know if it
does. I think you're I think you're
confused. My brother and I are signed
into each other's switches to share
games. When he plays, I can't use his
games. Yeah, that'll still be the way
though. This doesn't fix
that. Cuz when you take one out and put
it in the other, you can't play. This
won't fix your issue. My god, this is
going to confuse so many people. I'm
confused and I have a lot of Switch
experience. Now, this I honestly I'm not
even kidding. I don't think this fixes
your
issue. Uh Iana
says, "Uh, a few things. before if you
had to connect to the internet. Before
if you had connect to the internet to
play a download
game.
Oh. Oh, that's a good
point. God damn. So, if you turn this
feature off, you will still have to
connect to the internet to start up a
digital game or or on, I mean. But if
you do this new thing that they're
doing, you don't have to have internet
even even on your own switch. So if you
have if you have one switch, let's say
you have one switch, ladies and
gentlemen, and you have no family
members or no friends, you don't care
about any of that. You have one switch
up till now. If you buy a digital game
and you try to play it without
internet, it'll yell at you. This fixes
that, too. If you if you do this virtual
game card, as long as you connect to the
internet one time and you put the
virtual game on card on your system, you
can then turn the internet off and you
can play your games without the
internet. That's good, too. That is
good, too. That's a good like feature in
this as well by having that
on. That alone makes me actually want to
just have this on all the time.
There's there's definitely pros and cons
to this, but I think
generally unless
you I think generally speaking, unless
you have multiple switches and you try
and play on multiple switches, which who
does that honestly, like I I have a lot
of switches and I only use
one. So, by having this new feature on,
you don't have to be online to play your
digital games.
And if you do have family members on
your account, you can send them games
and you can trade
games. That seems to be all that changes
for you if you just have one switch and
maybe someone on your family
plan. That's not true. You can play
digital offline with without a
problem.
But I can't chat. I can't I can't do
this anymore. I can't do this anymore.
That's not That's not
a Is that
true? I remember when I went to film my
Tears of the Kingdom video in a cave
underground. I tried to load up Tears of
the Kingdom to play it in the cave. So,
I had footage of me playing it in the
cave and it wouldn't let me play the
game because I didn't have internet. I
had the game
digitally. That is a fact of something
that happened.
However, that might not have been my
primary
switch. You can't play
offline. Oh, I'm losing my mind. I'm
losing my actual marbles.
Can you play digital downloaded Switch
games offline?
Yes, you can play most digital Nintendo
Switch games offline after they are
fully downloaded, but you won't be able
to access online f. Okay, then you can
then you can play them
offline as long as it's your primary
switch. I think it has to be your
primary switch. Yes.
This is not This is not This is not any
This is not what I wanted. This is not
what I wanted for today in my
life. The only thing that worries me is
having to eject games than I than I want
to play or my son wants to play. Also, I
have to redownload again. Do I have to
redownload again? So, I'm going to make
a wild assumption here. I don't think
you have to reddownload it again. I
think once you eject a digital game and
give it to somebody, the game is still
downloaded to your console. You've just
removed the license to access it. I
think there'll be an option to delete
the game still if you like want to go
into the storage and delete Super Mario
Wonder in this case off your console,
but you won't be able to play the game
that's downloaded to the console until
you get the license back, which is
having the game returned. That's my
theory and my assumption. I actually
think it would be insane to do it the
other way. Like imagine you have like a
30 gig download game and you lend it to
somebody and then they they send it back
and you have to redownload 30 gigs
again. No, I don't think it works that
way at all. I don't think you're sending
30 gigs of data. I think you're
literally sending one megabyte of data,
which is just the license to play the
game. I would put money on that,
actually.
having to eject games when I want to
play or my son wants to play. Yeah, I
don't know what I don't know why that
worries you. That just sounds like
that's what we're going to
do.
Um, does it require membership? H, they
didn't
say Landon. This adds a second copy that
can be shared. You only have one shared
copy, but you still have your own
digital game as you do currently. Chat,
does that does that breakdown make? I'm
not even making fun because he gave 10
super chat. That does I have to read
that 10 more times. Landon, thank you.
This adds a second copy that can be
shared. I'm I already don't understand.
You only have one shared copy, but you
still have your own digital game as you
do currently. This is just giving you a
second copy to share. Landon, that's
actually not correct. That's actually
not correct. I love the $10. That's
actually not right. It does not give you
a second copy. You cannot play it. It's
only one copy. This is so
confusing. This is so confusing for
people.
And I don't blame you for being
confused. It's very
confusing. People aren't going to
understand
this. RGT in chat. Chat, way up. I am
crashing out. That does not sound
accurate. No, it doesn't.
No, it doesn't. Landon, thank you. Matt,
you can't log
in to the same account and play two
different games at the same time. Now
you can. Wait, let me hit me with that
again. Are you guys trolling me? You
can't log in to the same account and
play two different
games at the same time.
Wait, wait, wait. So, if I had two
Switches and I'm logged into the same
account, two different games, and I
wanted to play Breath of the Wild here
and Mario Wonder here at the same time,
you couldn't do that. Now, you
can. But why? How could I? I'm one
person now. I can. Why would I ever? Why
would I have two Switches in front of me
and I'm trying to play Mario Wonder and
Breath of the Wild at the same
time? And are you sure you couldn't do
that
before? What if one was offline? You
definitely could do that before. In
fact, if they were both offline, you
could you could have 10 Switches in
front of you on the same account playing
10 different games at the same time.
You definitely could do that. This is a
good feature for families. So, you can
have one account and play all your games
on multiple
switches. You can have one account and
play all your
games on multiple
switches. I mean, yeah. I mean, if you
have digital games, this second part is
true. I guess you could have digital
games and you could play all eight. You
can play up to eight digital games on
different
devices. I don't know. I don't know. I
don't know. I don't know about that one.
I don't know about that
one. You and your son, wife, etc. would
do that. You'd get an error. You and
your son, wife, etc. would do that. And
no, you'd get an error. Turning a simple
concept into rocket science. Hey, what?
chat is going to make this more
confusing. I'm way too high for this
shiz. Is wood slow? Uh, no. No.
Actually, I think I've got a handle on
it. I just don't
know how it's that different to how it
was before. And I don't think it is
other than sharing games to your
family. Do the digital game cards have a
weird taste, too? Now, that is a
question I do want answered here. That
is something we could get to the bottom
of. I
think it's simple. You're sharing the
license. That's it. Yes. When it comes
to family transactions, you're sharing
the license. Which is no different to
when you would share a physical
card. Get the facts straight for today's
podcast. I doubt I'm going to have them
straight by then. I got to be honest.
It's like they took your v virtual
games, turned them into game cards, but
put a lock on them and gave you one key.
Yeah, I agree with that. I agree with
that, Heath Holly. All right, here's a
$20 super chat. I'm loving these super
chats trying to explain this. One of the
reasons I have to wonder for this is to
encourage digital only. Yes, that I
agree with. I think this is them trying
to encourage digital purchases because
within families, families would always
go physical so that they can share games
around siblings and moms and dads can
share their games with their kids. And
so the family can trade off on these
digital games, but Nintendo doesn't have
a hold of whether you buy or or control
on whether you buy those games
pre-owned, if they get the sale from the
game, if the game was on sale. This
encourages people to pay full price for
a digital game knowing they can share it
within their family. This is number one
the reason they've done this. That's
100% correct. Two, for physical
libraries to make those physical games
now
digital, it's not a good feature. But
for you, it's not a good feature for
you, but I could see it for Nintendo to
push digital. Yes. I don't get too for
physical libraries to make those
physical games now
digital to make those physical. So
you're saying it's encouraging physical
collectors to buy digital. I don't think
it's doing that actually. I think I
think physical collectors have no extra
reason to do it just because it's
artificially a game cart now digitally.
I don't think it changes the the
physical collector mentality. But I
understand what you're saying and thank
you for the super chat. Will this skip
the installing time for digital games?
No,
no, no. It's Oh, god. No, it won't. It
It's still a digital game in every sense
of the word. This digital game cart
doesn't magically put the game onto the
system. Um, you still have to download
the game and uninstall the game uh like
it's a digital game.
Can you go back to the lens screen so we
can see those options? It looks like you
can remotely load or unload to your
second
console. Remotely load or unload to your
second console.
Yes. Okay. Really? All right. Let's take
a look. Can you go back to the lend
screen? Oh, I don't even know where the
lens screen was to be honest. I'm so
lost.
An internet connection is required only
when loading or ejecting.
With virtual game cards, you can freely
load and arrange which games you play on
up to two
systems. Local communication with your
second system is required, but only the
first
time. Honestly, I'm so burned out on it.
I don't I don't think they mention
remotely loading or unloading from
another Switch to be completely honest.
Why don't we just wait and see? True.
You know what?
True.
Holy.
Um, can we take a look at Metroid one
more time?
abilities.
You do need the Nintendo Switch online
expansion pack membership and also need
to eject, share game, load, receive
game, but no internet needed to play the
game after the
transfer. Says who? Says someone. Yeah,
said who. Did they say that? I don't
remember them saying that. Plus the
expansion pack that that was not said.
Where was that
said? like the $50 membership. They
never said
that. Last one. Do we think the Switch 2
cartridge slot will be a different size?
Yes, I think
so. If so, physical Breath of the Wild
maybe can't fit into Switch 2.
Therefore, wouldn't you need to play
physical Breath of the Wild on your
Switch 2? Physical Breath of the Wild?
No, no, no, no, no, no. it it'll be a
different size, but it'll be like the
3DS where you could put DS games into
the 3DS slot. You just couldn't put 3DS
games into the DS
slot. I bet this is also a signal that
there'll be levels of Switch 2 models
with varying amounts of storage. Okay,
now you can let your younger sibling or
child borrow your game even if you don't
want them to touch your system. Just
lend them your license. Yes, that is
true. That that seems to be the one very
clear thing we can all agree on. That is
the positive
here. Big time. Big time positive mess
around. I feel like they had to change
something change someone something
because the primary console concept is
about to be a nightmare with people
buying the Switch 2 and everyone is
going to have multiple switches. That's
a very very astute point. Very true. I
feel like they could just do away with
the primary account bull crap. But yes,
that is very true. Uh that's a good
point. Pretty much everybody is about to
have a second Switch and the primary the
primary console concept is probably
going to be quite annoying. Um you're
right with that 100%.
My friend bought Age of Calamity and
signed into my Switch using her
account. My friend bought Age of
Calamity and signed into my Switch using
her account so I could download it, but
I couldn't use my account to run it. I
had to use her account and her save
file. This fixes
that. Uh, if you're on the same family
account.
Yes.
Right. Is that what you're saying? If
you if if you're on the same family
account. Well, I guess it would signed
into my Switch using her account so I
could download it, but I couldn't use my
account to run it.
uh if you get on a family account with
her, you can use it. This actually still
wouldn't work with the new
system because it's still going to
be it's still going to be tied to her
account. And assuming she's using her
account, that physical game cart needs
to only exist on one and it's going to
or the physical digital whatever it's
going to ping back to her account after
14 days.
So, I don't think that does fix
it. That's
confusing.
Would Sorry. Sorry. Hold on a
second. Would Since you're
alive, ask me now. My time is limited. I
could I could be dead tomorrow. Since
I'm still here, why don't you go ahead
and play some Pokemon Violet?
Okay. Did you notice the wording? How
games after June 16th are on Nintendo
Switch and games after June 27th are on
Nintendo Switch
systems,
meaning June 16th and June 27th, the
Switch 2 launches between there. Did you
notice the wording of after June 16th
they're on Nintendo
Switch? You mean before before June 16th
they're on Nintendo Switch and games
after June 27th are on Nintendo Switch
systems? That would be an interesting
discovery if I didn't have to go through
and find out for
myself. You have any examples of
that? For anyone keeping the OG Switch,
that means we will have to move our
digital games to our Switch 2,
restricting access to those games on
Switch One, unless you move them back.
The old primary system sucked,
too. This is a crackdown on account
sharing. Before you can lend to anyone
through account, you will need internet
check. Now you need to be physically
close. You can share with and you can
share with just one person. For anyone
keeping the OG Switch, that means you
have to move our digital
games to our Switch
2. Restricting access to those games on
Switch One, unless you move them
back. That's a good point. I mean, I
don't know why I would want to play on
Switch One once I have them on Switch 2,
but you're right. I
guess I will have to manually move all
my digital games unless there's probably
a No, there's probably an importing
option. There'll be an importing option
when you set up the Switch 2. Do you
want to move all your games over? Yes.
But then they will be off the you will
you're right. They will then be off of
the Switch one. They will take them all
off of the Switch
One, which it wouldn't have done that
before. So, it is restricting access to
the games on that console. You will have
to move them back if you want to play
them on Switch One. But I don't know why
you would want to do
that.
God, local connection is required only
for the first time.
Yes. Yes. Would before you play before
on secondary accounts, you can't play on
other accounts. This lets you play your
games with other accounts,
too. It's probably for the best.
that that
happened. It's probably for the
best. We need to get out of
this. I'm
spiraling. Let's watch this really
quickly.
Okay, let's move on
to and what will be her fate after being
summoned to
view the threads intertwining beyond.
There's a couple shots here in
particular I want to look at.
But I mean this is lowresolution YouTube
streaming. I feel like this is a very
clear 1080p image. Like I don't see any
real anti-alasing like jaggedy edges.
Everything looks very clean. This looks
1080p. I mean it it doesn't it looks
like 480p because of YouTube, but seeing
through the fuzz this looks
clean. Oh, sorry. I I have it all moved
around. Sorry about
that. Now, this is the other shot I
wanted to look at. Unless they're doing
some kind of trickery. This is all like
the draw distance is crazy. The fog back
here in between the trees. The trees
look clean. I wonder if there's a better
trailer. So, if there's a standalone
Metroid Prime 4
trailer, let's see if we can get it in a
bit more high-
res. Let's see if we can play it. Let's
see if it even
plays. This is the unknown. Look how
clean it all looks.
All fully rendered
in. I feel like this is Switch,
too. You're zoomed way in. Yeah, it's
it's not that bad,
guys. I was trying to I was trying to
read things on the screen before. We can
We can calm down.
Yeah, I I feel like this is Switch too.
That's my That's my vibe. That's my vibe
on
that. All right, I got to I got to get
out of here. I'm not supposed to be here
still. I got to go. Uh, what time is it?
11:30. I'm going to go make a reaction
video. I'm going to try and get all my
thoughts down on paper. God help me with
this switch system part of the video.
Um, I'm going to go film a reaction
video. I'll leave this stream up for
brevity on how confused I was.
Um, and then later today I have my
podcast. So, if you want to come by
Nintendo podcast, I'll I'll I'll drop a
link in the description real quick and
if I got anything wrong in my video or
if more information came out between now
and then, I can dive into it on the
podcast in long form. Um, we're also
like 5,000 subs away from hitting
100,000 on the podcast. And uh I know
Twitch is already in it, but uh hey, if
if you guys haven't subbed yet, there's
like 5,000 of you in here right now. We
could get a play button today. Wouldn't
that be insane? Wouldn't that be nuts?
So, please make sure to check out
everything. Um
um tweet me if you if you find any
information about this online thing that
I'm still not getting. Tweet it at me, I
guess, and I'll take a look at it. Guys,
I love you all. Thanks for being here.
Sorry that so much of that was
confusing, but I really did have a great
time. I thought it was a really great
direct uh considering we expected
nothing. You know what I mean? So, uh,
I'll I'll see you guys like in 10
minutes in my main channel and then
later today on the podcast. The podcast
might be a little late. It depends on
when I get everything else
