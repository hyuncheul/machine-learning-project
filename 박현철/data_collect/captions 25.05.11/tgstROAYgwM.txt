it? Yeah. Well, that's that's a given.
That's like everything

offer. That's really good. They thought

magnetic.
Yes. Let's see the console.
Oh, here we go, baby.
Hardware. My Nintendo is so direct right
now. 7.9 in Switch 2 has a bigger
built-in screen. Here's how that
compares to Nintendo Switch. The
console's thickness remains the same.
Okay, she's still thick. Well, she's
still thin. With approximately double
the pixels compared to Switch, you can
enjoy games in greater detail on the
1080p screen.
1080p 1080p handheld screen.
Up to 100. Screen supports up to 120
frames per second allowing gameplay in
supported titles.
120 120 with HDR support. More vivid and
supports HDR, providing more contrast
between light and dark areas of the
images. How the hell did they do that?
The allnew Joy-Con 2 controllers connect
magnetically. What? Strong magnets keep
the controllers firmly attached to the
console. Detach your controller easily
by pressing the release button on the
back. Oh, such an
easy a
The SL and SR buttons are bigger. Oh,
yes. Comfort and control when playing
with a Joy-Con 2 held horizontally. Hell
yeah.
[Music]
The left and right sticks are now
[Music]
larger. Each Joycon 2 controller can be
used as a mouse to play compatible
games. Both the left and right Joy-Con 2
support mouse controls.
Dude, improved speakers with clear
audio. By adjusting the audio balance
between the ranges, sounds from the
built-in speakers are clearer and more
natural in handheld and tabletop modes.
How the heck did Nintendo do this? It
has a built-in microphone. You want to
chat with friends anytime via game chat.
It also uses noise cancelling technology
to filter sounds so your voice will come
through clearly. How How did they do it?
Dude, did Monolith Soft make the console
surround sound system. Games can be
enjoyed with more immersive
three-dimensional sound as if it were
coming from all 3D audio for support
games. 3D audio as well. Okay, if they
bust out a $399.99 price tag, I'm eating
my chair.
Place your Nintendo Switch 2 however you
like with a large sturdy stand. I like
the new stand like this.
[Music]
In addition to the USBC port found on
the bottom of the console, there's one
on top as well. Right. It's handy for
connecting a USBC camera.
I see what you did. or charging in
tabletop mode. Play. Oh, okay. That's
sweet. That's That's actually a really
nice slice of life feature. 256 GB of
internal storage, eight times that of

to the website.
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
I I don't know what to say,
But, and honestly, I don't care who's
watching this. This might be bias. I
don't know. But that was singlehandedly
one of the greatest events in video
games that I've seen in a very [ __ ]
long time. Nintendo held on to so much
and decided to release everything in one
event. I am still in absolute shock that
this has actually happened and all of
this has been revealed. The only thing
that we didn't get to see was a price.
Now, I don't know whether or not they're
going to hold off on showing the price
because what this console can do is
nothing short from incredible.
I I need to take a break because that's
a lot to digest in such a short period
of
time. But that was my reaction to the
Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. There was a
lot there that genuinely made me so
happy. So happy to the point I was in
tears.
Thank you,
Nintendo. Just just [ __ ] thank you.
[Laughter]
