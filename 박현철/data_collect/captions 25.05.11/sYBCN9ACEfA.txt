I'm just calling to say
[Music]
It's going
to circles.
Invincible
feel around.
I don't want to love you.
Everyone, welcome to the
stream. Today,
tonight, we gather
here to attempt to disturb the bag. That
bag being a Nintendo Switch 2. You might
be anxious. You might be
nervous. We're going to walk you through
it. But I'm also here to help relieve
that anxiety.
We're starting out the dream with
something that's always in
stock and never is sold out. There's
always plenty of supply in
demand. And that is finger.
[Music]
Heat. Heat.
[Music]
Let's go.
[Music]
Let's go, baby.
[Music]
We're getting it. We are getting that
[Music]
switch. Hit the like button. Come on.
What are you doing,
chat?
[Music]
Heat. Hey, Heat.
[Music]
Heat. Heat.
[Music]
All right, chat. Sorry about
that. Hopefully, you can hear me fine
now. That only happens during the hype
sesh with the with the loud
music. Okay, hold
on. Back
to back to regular
music. I'm out of breath. I kind of went
all out on that
one. Kind of went all out on that puppy
right there.
Still a little quiet. I'll fix it.
How's that right there?
How we how we doing now with the uh the
volume there?
All the links are in the description, by
the
way. Oh, I'm not even on the right
screen. Hold
on. There we go.
Sounds quite muffled. Okay, hold on.
I'll fix
it. Check one,
two. Oh, that's that's why. I think
that's why. I think it should be good
now. Oh, red red. Uh, you remember
Shadow Black? That was that was a long
time ago,
man.
Dang. All right,
Yadira. Yadira, I'm going to make you
mod for a second so you can let me
uh get the uh my mic going correct.
Okay. Okay. Um
Oh, you tuned in to the uh the stream
with Jeff Grub this
morning. All right, I'm gonna uh tune
into the stream for a second. Time to
secure the mic
check. I need to get a new mic. This
thing has been driving me crazy. It's
like it it gets worse every
stream. Oh, I appreciate you guys.
I want to say hi to as and read as many
names in the chat as I um as I
can, but I want to make sure the mic is
is good first.
Hi Jake, thanks for being awesome. Jake,
thanks for being awesome. Just wanted to
know if we need to do any refresh at
midnight either at our website or do we
wait till it says available? Thank you
so much for the 10. um you want to
refresh the website at like 11:59 p.m.
Eastern time, obviously convert that to
your time zone and then as soon as the
website works and changes, then go in
the apps because you can't refresh the
apps. So use the website to know when
it's live and then have the app ready
and click on the item. So have like
search for Switch 2 in the app and then
don't click on the actual product page
until your website refreshes and goes
live. Then click on it in the
app. Oh, I fixed my audio. Let's
go. Yo, what's up, Gameberg
Classic? All right, I'm going to say hi
to some people.
Raphael, New House, Parth, Pandit, uh,
CGNN, Quigon Jeans, Mr.
Faithful, Kevin Donahghue, Coco Man 17,
WeatherKit 11, Beat Mike the Lawn Muer,
that's kind of funny name. Uh, Simon,
um, Dean Jackson, hi from Chicago.
Hello, Michael Dwire Jr., Goonar
49, CT
uh Eric Shazerata Dormat. Dormat's a
good name. Um Rud Dog 10, CJ Gaming,
Media Mosley, Ty Shellar, Carly Ray,
T-Man Plays, Green
Animation. What is going on, guys?
Ulysus
[Music]
Ashburn. Who is Grant Weisler? And is
that an insult if I look like
him? Uh Wes Nemo, what's up? Goat
Randall. Love to see
it. I don't have the game on. I'm not
watching the Celtics right
now. Probably not. There's a chance it's
not going well cuz the Magic are legit
and Tatum's not
playing. Yo, it's good to see everybody.
So, hold on. Can we get 1,000 likes
before kickoff? Oh, thank you, Gunnar
49, for that super chat. I appreciate
you.
I appreciate you, Anime Girl 90, too. I
I don't think I read your name. I just
read your question.
Um, and then Greece, thank you for the
fives. Thanks for all the videos, Kings.
We only have one Best Buy in Rhode
Island. GH Yeah, Best Buy is going to be
tough in general. If you've only got
one, I wouldn't recommend it.
Uh, Kyle, thank you so much for the f
guys, this is overwhelming. Thank you so
much. Um, Kyle asks, Kyle Sakai, if I
can't secure a pre-order tonight, what
time would be optimal to get my GameStop
to wait for pre-order? You have 35. 35's
tough. Um, I would say probably like 2
a.m., honestly.
Stores with 45. The employees
recommended getting there at 6:00 a.m.
So, maybe. Um, oh, Elbots in the chat.
Let's go.
And then SF Productions, thank you for
the Jake. You helped me get a PS5 in
2021, so I'm know I'm in good hands with
this. Just super chatting just to say
thank you. I appreciate that,
bro. Can I raise my mic
volume?
Can. Okay. How are we doing now with the
mic
volume? That
uh is that better?
be honest with
me. Y I appreciate you guys,
too. All right. Um, that should be a lot
better. I I
hope this is my first time doing a
console pre-order pre-sale with you.
I've always done controllers. Very
excited. Hey, well, welcome, Dorine.
Thank you so much for the for the five.
All right, I think what I got to do here
is just the oldfashioned way. Go watch
my stream from my phone for a second and
then I can just nip this
microphone. I'm I'm glad we're figuring
that out right now.
Okay. Um, yo, Okana, thank you for
joining the Jakey Gang. I appreciate
you, man. It's great to see you, by the
way. How are we uh how are we doing here
on Lakeis, by the
way? Do we do we hit a thousand?
Oh, we're at 800. We're close. We are
close,
sir. So, to me, the mic sounds really
good. I'm watching on my phone. Um, did
did we fix it, chat? Are we go in chat?
Uh, Rebecca, thank you for the five. I
appreciate your help to the PS5 madness.
With your streams, I could almost
guarantee I could get one for one per
month for That's awesome, Rebecca. Thank
you so much. Justin, thank you for the
10. What time should I go to my
GameStop? I went there just now to see
the sign. They're going to have 35
bundle sets and 15 with this system. 50
units total. I would say 5:00 a.m. if
you want to be safe, but you could you
might be able to get away with 6 or 7. I
probably wouldn't go later than
love of your constructive information on
this chaotic period with filled with
misinformation. I hope Canada won't be
as great. Oh, thank you, Maple Lizard. I
appreciate you.
I always love to see uh how many people
watch that aren't in the United States
because obviously my stuff is very
tailored to the United States. I wish I
could do other countries, but it's just
very difficult for me to even just keep
track of one country.
But I find a lot of people in the UK and
Canada and even more are like, I just I
love watching you, so I just come back.
Anyways,
so a couple things you guys should know
about the stream is there is a ticker
below that has crucial information in it
that will be rolling throughout the
stream.
Thank you for the five. Windy City
Craig, thank you so much for your work.
I appreciate you. So, pay attention to
that ticker. If I see a lot of the same
question being asked in the chat, I will
add to the ticker, okay? I'll answer it
for sure, but just I might have answered
it like if you just joined the chat now,
I might have answered that question five
minutes ago and I don't want to repeat
myself. I will repeat myself probably
every 30 minutes or so, but not back to
back to back, right? So, I'll add really
commonly asked questions to that little
ticker that's scrolling below. But
there's also a lot of key information in
the description, which you can access by
closing out of the chat and expanding
the live stream description. And then
the blue people in the chat are also
looking at your questions and answering
them. So, don't just listen to me, look
for the blue names in the chat or even
just non-blue names in the chat. There's
a lot of really knowledgeable people
people here. That's why the live
stream's so awesome. We have a great
community.
Um, yo, Matthew Williams says he's going
to donate a hundred if he gets the
console tonight. I appreciate you, man.
I appreciate just the $2 donation.
Uh, Brandon Chips, thanks for the help.
Your story of cystic fibrosis is
inspirational. See how you push through
is amazing. Cheers to all of us locking
in our Switch to Brandon, I really
appreciate the $10 donation. And uh,
yeah, I'm I have cystic fibrosis. Um,
My life expectancy when I was born was
was 10 and uh in my 20s they told me my
life expectancy was 30. It grew. Uh but
then a new medication came
out must have been six years ago now. It
was late
2019 and it totally changed my life.
It's called tririca and I only have 40%
lung function. I won't get that back but
I'm not declining anymore. So, I could
have potentially
a normalish life expectancy at this
point. It's kind of a miracle. So, I'm
doing fantastic for anyone asking, but
if you think I look a little skinny or I
look a little sickly, that that would be
why. Um, Al Camp, thank you for the 20,
man. I'm at uni. Mail goes to them
first. Annoying. Should I try to order
online and then go into the morning to
GameStop? Just afraid of getting charged
twice and not getting the package
correctly. Uh well, if you order through
Best Buy, you pick up in
store. Um but so I I would go for Best
Buy tonight. Um or possibly Target. And
then if you don't get there, then yeah,
maybe go to
games. And then what's the deal with
Sam's Club? Is that also an option?
Thank you for the five, sir. Gus, Sam's
Club is an option, but we don't know
when they're going live. We don't know
if they're doing pre-orders or tonight
or if they're going to do pre-orders in
the future. They're not one of the
authorized retailers Nintendo has listed
on their site to launch pre-orders like
on the first day they're available, but
obviously Sam's Club is owned by
Walmart. So, Walmart will probably take
the first crack, but don't sleep on
Sam's Club. All the links are in the
description, including Sam's
Oh, nice. Celtic, thank you for the
update on Celtics game, Jim.
Um, Jake, I've been watching you since
the PS5 videos. I have a question. If I
use Target gift cards, would that slow
or fast in the process?
Um, that's a tough one cuz it doesn't
have to process your payment like from
your bank. It's going to be using its
own internal system for that. So, that
should be better than like debit or
credit card. I don't know if it'll work
as good as PayPal or Apple Pay, but
obviously you want to use those gift
cards if you have them.
Um, Niha, thanks for all you do for us,
Jake. Oh, thank you so much and thanks
for being a member for as long as you've
been as
well. Uh, guys, the blue name in the
chat, Labelora Times is like my my my
goat, my partner in crime, my partner in
going against the scalpers and the bots.
Um, he's answering tons of questions in
the chat right now, and his Twitter is
linked in the description as well. He's
going to be the one tweeting out the
links and letting you know like via
Twitter X when different places go into
stock when they sell out. And I'll be
retweeting him. I can focus on the
stream. But yeah, Labela Times aka Elbot
is is
goated. You guys can see I've got
slow-mo 35 seconds and the questions are
still coming too fast for me to keep up.
I can I can barely keep up with the
super chats. You do not have to super
chat if you want me to read your
question. Um I'm just trying to get to
those obviously because because they're
coming in, but um I will do my best, but
the blue names in the chat are really
really clutch for questions.
Uh Arjun, thank you so much for the five
longtime viewer, first time commenter.
Appreciate you and best of luck
everybody. Thank you so much, man. All
right, I got to stop for a second.
Um, Alyssa Kate,
uh, a $100 donation is, uh, I don't even
I'm You got me
speechless. Thank you so much. Uh, and
all your super chat is you, you don't
even ask a question. You just say,
"Thank you for helping everyone their
pre-orders be so and being so
informative." Uh, thank you for that.
That gesture means a lot to me.
Um, Alyssa Kate is is also now
goated. Uh, and then you mage collector,
thank you for the 10. And it and he just
said, "Thank you so much, Jake, from New
York. Keep at it." And I appreciate that
as well. Says, "No one has to donate
whatsoever." I just I just want to say
that like I appreciate the donations and
like honestly it's like the feeling
behind it, the love. Thank you so much.
How could I not express my gratitude for
that? But I just want you to know that
that doesn't have to be
something. So, I'm going to try right
now to to read some some regular chat
questions. Uh, can you show us how to
set up PayPal?
So basically to set up PayPal, the best
way is go on the websites right now,
whichever one you're going for, Target,
Best Buy, Walmart, whichever one, and
add something to your cart, just like a
regular thing, like I did it before the
stream when I was getting ready. I just
added a gallon of milk. And then go to
pay. And then when you go to pay, go and
select PayPal. and then you'll see if
that retailer uses PayPal and how easily
you'll be able to choose it. That's the
best way. Just, you know, you have time.
We've got a few hours. So, go ahead play
around with it. Get familiar with the
website. Just Moody, thank you for the
time. Thanks for the help. You guys are
going to be worn out when this is over.
Oh,
yeah. Yes, we are. I appreciate you,
man. Is that Oh, just Moody. I thought I
recognized your your picture, but I
actually don't think
um I might recognize your name, but it
was the picture that I thought was from
something else.
Uh Big D here. Nice name. Nice name. If
we want to switch day one, do you
recommend to skip GameStop and pre-order
from Target, Walmart, and or Best Buy? I
ask because it says one to three day
shipping once released on the So yeah,
GameStop. That's a great question.
GameStop, their online orders are
shipped to home only. You can't pick up
in store.
And they did the same thing with the
PS5. So, when the PS5 came out, I
pre-ordered mine from GameStop and it
was actually going to take two weeks
after launch day. Uh, that was one of my
first ever streams. And because I was a
noob at streaming, one of my viewers got
my pre-order info cuz I held it on the
screen too long and they cancelled my
pre-order. They they got GameStop to
think that they were me and they they
got it cancelled by email and giving the
order number. Because they did that, I
had to try to buy one on launch day. And
because of them, I actually got my PS5
on launch day because I got it on stream
at Target. So, thank you so much whoever
that was for making sure I got my PS5 on
launch day. And also, whoever that was
signed me up for a free uh adult website
with the username J Randy, which was
objectively hilarious, and I also
enjoyed that. Uh, Braden Gilbert, thank
you for the five. I have the Best Buy
gift card that can pay half the cost.
Should I use that or just put the full
amount on my debit card? Um, I would use
the gift card. And I'm so glad you just
super chatted that
because your beautiful presence is
exactly what I Thank you guys.
Appreciate you,
Shannon.
Um, so Best Buy in particular always
likes to just like won't allow your
transaction to go through. And it it
does it for de It actually does do it
for credit cards. I tweeted about this
earlier that it's just debit cards, but
it does it for credit cards, too. over
here. So, if you use PayPal, it will
never be triggered as fraud by Best Buy,
but if you use a credit or debit card,
it might. So, banks have 24-hour um
hotlines that you can call. Uh so, I
would you still have time if you're
going from Best Buy with a card, call
your bank to make sure that anything
that would typically trigger a decline
transaction does not happen tonight. Let
them know you have a $500 pending
authorization potentially. So, to make
sure that's
clear, uh, Mike Allen, thank you for the
five. Just want to wish you luck over
here. I'm planning on getting through
the online GameStop. I have a $200
GameStop. Oh, there you go. Yeah. Um,
honestly, you could also pre-order in
person if it doesn't work out for you.
Well, if you're going for GameStop,
that's tomorrow morning. So, I guess
going to go for that. But possibly get
in line at GameStop, too, just to make
sure cuz GameStop's going to be
everyone's last option if they don't get
it tonight. It's going to be kind of
kind of difficult. And then RS EMS,
thank you for gifting five channel
membership. You were if you were gifting
one of those memberships, make sure you
thank
it. When Jake got the shiny Reggie
Lucky, that was funny. when I had like
500 subscribers on this channel and I
was streaming Pokemon Sword and Shield.
This was right after that new medicine
came out that kind of saved my life.
That's why I started doing YouTube
actually because of that medicine. Um,
but I was like, "Hey guys, wouldn't it
be funny to try to shiny hunt for Reggie
Lucky?" Got it on my second try. I guess
I was like, "All right, I guess
the You're the reason I got a PS5 for
Christmas that launch year. God bless
you." Wow. Thank you so much, Johnny. I
really appreciate
Jake, you shot my day every day. Oh,
shucks. I I love you, chat. This is I've
been so excited for this. When
pre-orders got delayed, I was
def I was probably more emotional about
it than I been, but it's because I was I
was looking forward to having this
experience with you. I love making the
videos, but nothing compares to the live
one-on-one interaction.
You're you're goed,
chat. Do you prefer uh the MySpace guy?
Nice. Do you prefer the web browser over
the phone app? Uh I actually do for most
places. Uh if you're trying your luck
with Walmart,
uh definitely. But the thing about the
website for all these places is you can
refresh it and you can't do that on the
app. So, what I like to do is be
refreshing the websites
and then as soon as the websites go live
and I can see it, then I'll enter the
app because I know it's live at that
point.
Um, fun
factor. Um, yo Jake, I have my links
ready. Should I start refreshing them a
minute before midnight or they auto
refresh once the pre-order time begins?
So the links won't auto refresh. So you
do want to start refreshing them, but
don't refresh them a minute before.
Start refreshing them like 20 or 15
seconds before because if you refresh
too much on a place like Walmart, uh
it'll block you. It'll block your IP
address and you don't want that. So
definitely be refreshing right before.
Um Walmart is better. They don't do it
as much now. So, you'll probably be fine
if you start a minute ahead, but I've
got PTSD from PS5 and stuff. So, I I
like to wait a little on stream. I'll
start refreshing probably a minute
before because if I get blocked, I don't
care. It's whatever. I'm doing this for
um it was thanks to you I got a PS5 in
November of 2020. Wild times. Thanks for
being an awesome re. Hey, thank you
Quigon Jeans. I appreciate that,
bro. Um, worldrenowned Geio Hound, do I
need to add a payment option on any one
of the sites or can I just use Apple Pay
and you help me get my PS5? Yeah. No, if
you have Apple Pay set up, you can use
that uh for sure. Then you wouldn't
really have to. I like to have a debit
or credit card saved just as a backup in
case something crazy happens, but Apple
Pay is much better way to pay than a
credit or debit card. And again, if you
guys weren't here, the reason for that,
same thing with PayPal, same thing with
Google Pay. When you use those payment
methods, your payment is processed on
their servers instead of the server of
the retailer that is being throttled
with traffic of people trying to
pre-order. So, having your payment
processed on a server that isn't being
throttled with traffic is always an
advantage.
And then, uh, ZBombie 90, thank you for
the five. You helped me and my brother
get PS5s at launch. Thanks for
everything. Good luck, everyone. Oh,
that's nice. I appreciate that. You see,
Bombi, hopefully I can help you again
tonight. Uh, Kylie W. Oh, thank you for
the 20 big I'm unable to have a switch
to this time around, but I'm happy to be
here for the vibes. Thanks for all that
you do, man. Super glad to hear your Oh,
thank you, Kylie. I hope you're able to
to pick one up
soon. I hope you're able to get one for
launch. Um, in your opinion, will be
easier to get the bundle or the regular
Switch? Thank you for the five frits.
And yeah, guys, so GameStop started
posting how many units they're going to
have for Inerson pre-orders tonight. And
every single GameStop has twice as many
Mario Kart bundles as they do standalone
consoles. So that what that tells us is
it's very likely that that will hold
true um across the retailers. So
probably twice as many Mario Kart
bundles as just Switches. So that should
be easy. But what we don't know is how
many people are going for the bundle
versus just the console. Do we think
more people are going for the bundle? It
does give you $30 off Mario Kart, but it
code so it's tricky. I'm probably going
to be going for the bundle all the way.
I I think that will be
uh Pokey Jojo, thank you for the five.
Walmart is having a technical issue when
trying to log in. Anything should I do I
should do or just wait it out? Hope you
can try logging in on different
browsers. Uh, that's what I would do for
sure. And then if it doesn't work, yeah,
you're going to have to wait a little
bit and then try
again. Um, I'm almost caught up on super
chats
here. It's me,
Angela, my wonderful moderator, donating
$10 just to say I hope I got the Switch,
too. Angela, you deserve it. For Angela,
you're a pro. You know what you're
doing. I I think you're going to be
okay. Walmart is crashing hard, huh?
Okay, let's let's take a look at this.
Take a look at Walmart for a
second. I'm already signed in, which you
should try to get yourself signed in
everywhere as soon as possible for this
exact reason. But yeah, I go to refresh
and it's just a spinning circle of
death. Oh, it actually it did
work. But yeah, the the site's already
starting to get a little slow, little
laggy. As you can see here, guys, I've
got Walmart uh Mario Kart bundle, Target
Mario Kart Bundle, Target regular,
Walmart regular, and then both for Best
Buy as well. Those are the three places
that are going live tonight. And we're
going to we're just going to watch this.
Have something
up. Little bit hopeful now that I know
my GameStop has 125. That's a healthy
number.
That is a very healthy number. Um,
that's about the most I've seen is 120,
but it's weird. I a lot of places seem
to have
like 60 or less or like 120.
So, and it's not all big cities that had
120. You know what I
mean? Right.
Yeah, Walmart seems to be tweaking now
for everyone for sure.
Do I try to get accessories online? This
is a great question. This is a one of
the most common questions is people are
wondering like should I try to buy
everything I want like get all the
accessories and the console or should I
just go for the console and then try to
like go back for
accessories.
Uh and honestly if you want to play it
safe I mean I would just go for the
console or a bundle. Best Buy has
bundles that include some accessories.
Like if you look right here, this one
includes the controller. That one
actually might go faster than this is
going to be very very popular. But some
of the ones
that
include like this steering wheel, it's
only an extra, you know, 25 bucks that
no one's really going
to. Both of these games are pretty
popular, so that's that's probably going
to be. But like still, that's going to
be a lot less popular than just a
regular Mario Kart. So, the more
expensive it is, the easier it'll be to
get because scalpers don't go for
bundles at
all. My mic is cutting in and
out. Um, I might have the
uh I might have the gate up too.
All right. Um, mic sounds okay. Yira,
thank you for that. I did I did turn the
gate down a little
bit. This this mic is so quiet, so it
does clip a lot. So, I I'm getting a new
mic next stream for
sure. Can't be put off any
longer. Clouds. Oh, yeah. My background.
Cloud Strife. Huge Final Fantasy 7 fan.
My favorite game of all
time. What mic you got? It's a blue uh I
forget what it's called. Can you see it
on the on the stream? Can see it a
little
bit. Guy right
here. I don't know. It's a couple
hundred bucks. I mean, it's not like
cheap cheap, but I could probably get a
nice
It's not a Blue Yeti. Um, a Blue Yeti uh
works pretty well, but it's very That's
a pretty inexpensive microphone.
Hey man, just want to say thanks for the
quality info this launch and wish all of
our Nintendo gaming friends good luck
tonight. Well, thank you so much, B.
Diddy.
Nice name, dude. I'm not covering
Canadian websites actually. Uh, thank
you for the uh, super chat, Dragon Chi.
You want uh, updates on Canada. I don't
know anyone on YouTube or that's
streaming, but Elbab El L Babins on
Twitter is amazing. Um, just kind of
type that in as it sounds. He should pop
up even if you spell it wrong. But he
will be sharing links and updates on
Twitter. Looks like Walmart shut down
for a minute. Yikes.
Hey R J Ramos, thanks for the one. I
appreciate that. Oh, Elbot, thank you
for ch sharing in the chat. Um, guys,
Labora Times just shared Elbabin's uh
Twitter account in the
chat. Walmart's getting a little messed
up.
Um, one one thing I'm going to do a
shameless plug of real quick is uh like
the stream if you haven't. I have no
idea how many likes we're
at. We are at We're at,00. I'm pretty
happy with that, but we get 5,000 by the
end of the night, which is far ahead. I
I think we can do it. And the other
thing is I recently started my own uh
bakery and it's literally just at the
beginning stages, but we have an
Instagram and it's the QR code above my
head and it's also linked in the
description. So if you want to follow us
on Instagram in the future, I'm going to
have a special fourpack of cookies that
I'll offer for shipping. I don't have
the website set up yet, so can't do it
for now. But if you want to check us out
and follow us, uh you can scan that QR
code. Oh, Bundy, thank you for the
fiveman. Um, could you please remind
people that micro SD cards only?
Not enough people are talking about
that. Uh, yeah. So, you need to uh it's
not micro SD cards only. It's micro
micro SD Express cards are only
compatible with the Switch 2. So,
regular micro SD cards will not work.
You need to express and they are a lot
more expensive. Uh, but they make the
games run a lot faster. already. It's
almost like an SSD, uh, but not quite.
Uh, Carly Ray, here are your Best Buy
SKs in case anyone wants
them. Awesome. Thank you for sharing
those SKs, Carly Ray, and thank you for
the super chat. I appreciate you.
Yes, Al Bundy. Yes, Express. The Micro
SD Express. Yeah, don't worry. I got
you. I remembered.
And then what happens if you got a
console and already registered
interest? Um, well, if you registered
interest, that just means you might be
able to buy it from
Nintendo. Uh, that doesn't mean it's
going to charge your card or anything.
So, if you get it from a different
retailer and you get the email from
Nintendo and you want to buy it from
them instead, then you could cancel your
retailer order and buy it from Nintendo.
Uh, Meat Puppet, thank you for being a
member for 35 months. Uh, I doubt
Express cards are faster. Faster than
what? Because they have the speeds
listed on them. So, yeah, they are
extremely fast compared to a regular uh,
micro SD
card. They're not as fast as an SSD, but
they are like within
range. Probe Gang. Hey, Monkey D
Broen. You're you're part of the probe
gang, too?
Um, Josh asks, "Question. This is the
first time I'm doing this. I refunded a
laptop on Best Buy and have a Best Buy
gift card. Can I pre-order the Switch 2
with that card?" Uh, yeah, of course you
can. That'll probably work a little
better than uh debit or credit card.
Maybe not as well as as PayPal or Apple
Pay. You heard about the one TB Lexar um
Express card? Yeah, it seems to be the
most popular cuz it's the most
reasonably priced for now. I'll be
honest with you guys, I'm not going to
buy an uh micro uh express SD card
probably for a year or two cuz they're
going to get so much cheaper. That's
what happened with
SSDs. That's what happened with regular
micro SD cards. Um you can get like a
512 GB one now for
like, you know, like 2030 bucks
sometimes. A hat is way better than
bandana. Ah, I was I was debating
bringing back a bandana, but then I
couldn't find
one. But I feel like I got to bring a
bandana back at some point. Maybe on
launch day, even if just for a little
bit. That was kind of my thing back in
the
day. Uh, do retailers charge you for
pre-order immediately? Yes, they will
charge you a pending authorization. So,
it'll remove the funds from your
account, but they aren't actually
charging you. So then the funds will get
returned to your account either later
that day, but it could take up to a
week. Your team
Bandana, the bandana days were PE. I
might have to bring it back. I have this
one that I got at a
blink2 a little. Looks a little weird.
Does Philip still exist? Of course he
does. Where is
he? Oh, he's in his bed. I'm not going
to disturb him, but he will be on stream
later. Guys, I'm feeling really good
about this.
Um, let's
see. What's so bad about buying with a
debit credit card compared to just doing
it through PayPal? Is there something
I'm missing? Uh, yeah. So, I went over
that a couple minutes ago. Um,
basically my mic just cut out. Uh
oh. Uh, are we good,
chat? Oh, I'm back. Okay. Sorry.
Um, but to answer the question, when you
pay with a credit or debit card, it
processes your payment on the same
servers as the website that you're
buying from.
So that website is getting slammed with
traffic and when you pay with PayPal or
Apple Pay, it processes your payment on
their servers. So it basically like lets
you get where everyone else gets stuck.
It lets you get past that that
step.
Um Britney Walsh says we need to get
some custom
bandanas. I You know what, Britney? I
agree. That would be kind of sick. So
like a big finger gun on my forehead.
Finger gun bandana would go hard. Yeah.
Okay. So, uh, everybody say hi to to
Britney Walsh in the
chat. That is my lovely girlfriend and
future wife.
And I guarantee you she's bright red
right now and I'm going to get in so
much trouble for saying future wife. But
it's funny. Um, it's also true. If I get
the crazy $600 bundle, will I still be
able to get stuff that comes out day
one, just not Donkey Kong? You go. Yes,
exactly. So bundles on Best Buy that
have Donkey Kong comes out in July.
You'll get the other stuff on launch
day, but then you won't be able to pick
up Donkey Kong obviously until July.
It's basically just like
pre-ordering. It's like pre-ordering
Donkey Kong for July, but pre-ordering
the console for if that makes sense.
Like if I went to pre-order Ghosts of
Yote from PlayStation right now, that
comes out in October. I could pre-order
something else from PlayStation that
comes out a different day. You know what
I mean?
Hi, Britney. Marry him.
Yeah. So, Britney is the head baker and
chef for our bakery. We started this
business together, the Sunflower Bakery
and Cafe that's above my
head. And uh yeah, if you check out her
Instagram, she is amazing. Thank you so
much for making me dinner tonight, by
the way, Britney. It was delicious.
I'm very lucky. She always makes like
incredible She's She's been like the
head chef at like super nice like fancy
hotel restaurants.
She's done everything. And
uh yeah, I'm I'm very lucky.
Love you, Brit.
Uh will I have a better chance with the
bundle?
uh you'll have much better chance of the
bundle, you guys, because there's about
twice as many Mario Kart bundles as
there is just like standalone Switch 2
console.
Uh what do I think of the launch lineup?
Uh the launch lineup is great. There's a
lot of third party support. Obviously, I
wish there was more Nintendo exclusives.
Mario Kart World is huge. But that's
kind of a good point. Like if let's
let's say devil's advocate you don't get
one uh for launch
day. I love you old bag of bones. Love
you too Brit.
Um let's say you don't get one on launch
day. Yeah you're not able to play Mario
Kart right away but you know Donkey Kong
doesn't come out till July and then we
don't know about anything else after
that. But at the end of the day when you
do end up getting one it just means
you'll have more games to play cuz the
launch lineup for first party isn't
crazy.
Um,
you're going to get accused of anymore
because it's a game key card. Yeah, the
game key cards are turning off a lot of
people. I I know I'm going to get so
much hate for this and I probably just
shouldn't even say it, but you know me,
I always keep it real. I I think I'm
just going to go all digital with the
Switch 2 because I've got like 400
Switch One
games. And when I travel, which is
often, I take like 50 games with me,
right? And then I always find myself
craving wanting to play something that I
left at my
house. And I don't want to take 400
cartridges with me and then potentially,
you know, end up misplacing my case,
right? and, you know, losing thousands
of dollars. And that's also why I'm
waiting on the Micro Express SD card cuz
I can just play I can just shuffle my
games around with downloading
them. I'm never going to resell any game
that I buy. And I think buying them
digitally will make me be a lot more
selective.
I I don't support the all digital
future, but for me, many of my physical
Switch One games, I've ended up rebying
them digitally out of convenience and
I've just kind of accepted that for me
personally, even though I don't advocate
it for everyone. I understand that me
going this route makes it easier for
them to do to do this, but I'm just I'm
tired. I I'm I'm I'm just ready to go
all digital.
I'm team. I mean, look behind me. You
know what I mean? I'm definitely team
physical. It It hurt, but I especially
with running the bakery now. I you know,
it'll help me spend less money on all
the all the
games and it'll make sure I buy the
games I'm going to play so they don't
get put in a backlog and I enjoy them.
But anyways, that's kind of maybe I'll
make a video on that at some point, but
I just want to keep it real with you,
chat.
Uh, renowned. Uh, thank you for the
five. Yeah, we were just talking about
the Best Buy bundles. So, yeah, we we we
saw that there's there's a ton of them
here. Those are very, very real. The
more expensive the bundle, like there's
a $720 one. Who hasn't played Gears of
the Kingdom and Breath of the
Wild, you know, at this point? who
wanted to. So, this one will probably
last forever.
That's a crazy high price and it's games
that we've already had years to play.
Um, after the switch to pre-order
fumble, I'll probably never get a Switch
to. If I do, I'm going to wait at least
a year, maybe two. Yeah, I mean, I I get
that, man. Uh, Matthew Williams says,
"Does Best Buy do inerson orders?" They
do
not. Uh, hey Rebecca, thank you again.
Um, I might go digital, too, because my
brother-in-law constantly borrows my
games and it's so hard to get them back.
The new loan system is great for me. You
get 14 days, buddy. That's a great
point, too. Yeah.
Um, let's see. at midnight. Should I
click into one of the bundle links on
Best Buy or should I look at the list of
bundles like what is showing on your
screen? Uh, thank you for the five,
David. So, when it gets to midnight, you
want to decide what you're going for
first, right? So, if you decide that,
okay, I think that the Street Fighter
bundle
uh plus the amiibo, a lot of people
probably won't go for that. So, I'm
going to go for that one. So, have it
loaded up. So click on it, have it load
it up, and then like at 11:59, you're
going to probably start refreshing a
little
bit. So that's that's what I would
do. I would I would pick it first
because you're just giving yourself an
extra step, an extra page to load if
you're not on it already. You know what
I mean?
Let's see. Celtics 105 to 94 without
Tatum. All right. This series in the
bag. Okay. Can you please explain the
Walmart Q system? I thought you refresh
the add to cart button and then check
out. Not sure what you mean by getting
in a queue. Okay. Great question.
what you do for
Walmart at 11:59. You're not going to
start
refreshing. You're gonna start Yeah.
Make sure you're signed in, by the way.
Make sure you're signed in
now. You're going to start refreshing.
You're going to wait like 30, 45
seconds. You're not going to start
refreshing right at 11:59. You're going
to wait. Again, if you refresh too much
on Walmart, they'll block your IP
address and kick you out.
link for the bundle pages. Um, if you
just go to Best Buy
Oh, actually, no. The link for the
bundle pages is in the
description. It's it's it's it's in
there. Yeah, you can pick those up, too.
Obviously, if you if one of the bundles
has something that doesn't come out at
launch, you'll pick that up when that
comes out. So, you'll still get the the
Switch at launch, but like Donkey Kong,
you'll get that. You'll pick that up
when it comes out.
So what what happens with Walmart is
you'll start refreshing probably like
you'll try to time it so it's 15 seconds
maybe before midnight and then you just
refresh the entire web page. You're not
clicking add to cart cuz it's it's not
there. There is no add to cart. You're
just refreshing Walmart, right? Then
what'll happen is eventually one of the
times you refresh this will change and
it says you're in line. As soon as it
says that stop refreshing. That's it.
That's all you got to do. And then
you're in line, right? Giving you a
random place in line. As soon as it does
that, stop refreshing the web page.
Enter the Walmart app and click on it
there and you'll get a separate place in
line. That's a different place in line
than you have on the website. So now you
have two chances instead of just one.
And it's random. So as long as you're
like you enter within the first 30
seconds, you don't have to enter right
away. If you enter like 2 minutes late,
you're not going to get in. But if you
enter like within the first 30 seconds,
you'll get put you get a random place in
line. So the last person to join might
be the first person to get a Switch.
It's like a lottery. And by joining on
the app after you join on the website,
you get two chances.
So after that, you just wait and you'll
whichever one gets through the queue or
the line first, then it'll look at like
add to cart as normal and then you just
go through the payment process. And you
hit 10 minutes. It stays in your cart
for 10 minutes.
We're in the end game now. Yes, thank
you for the five, Doctor Strange. I
appreciate
you. And
um Jacob, do you think console prices
will increase after launch due to
tariffs? I I No, I don't. Thank you for
the five. I think Nintendo made
sure that no matter what happens that
they are not going to have to ever
increase price of
the So all right. So that was Walmart.
Let's go over Let's go over Target now.
Uh we'll go over Best Buy in a second
for
sure. Remember, if you're finding this
useful, consider liking the stream and
subscribing to the channel perhaps.
Um we're almost up to 1500 likes, which
pun intended, I like to see
it. What do you recommend doing if you
want a few accessories? Well, buy the
console, then the accessories, if you
want to play it safe, that's what I
would do.
Yeah. Um, so before I answer more of the
super chat, well, that was the last one
for now, but I just want to go over
Target quickly. Target does not use a Q
system. Target's going to be the good
oldfashioned at 11:59, you start
refreshing, and you don't stop
refreshing until you get add to cart.
And Target's going to be really annoying
um because of the traffic on their
website. It might show like sold out or
not like let you do it even though it's
still in stock. It's just because they
can't handle the traffic. The Target you
just have to be persistent. You could be
trying at 12:05, 1210, you know, 5 10
minutes go by. With Target, you have to
be persistent. But what's great is since
Walmart and Best Buy use cues, meaning
once you refresh on Walmart and Best
Buy, it just makes you wait in line and
there's nothing else you can do. So, you
want to make sure you're all set on on
Walmart and Best Buy. Let those sit and
wait and then just focus on refreshing
Target. And then the way you can refresh
in the app for Target is close out the
app and then go back in. So, you're
going to be refreshing on your computer
and doing the same thing with the app,
unless you're using your phone to be in
the Walmart
app. Uh, does Clara work? Uh, do you
recommend the site or on my PC? So, for
for Clara and Affirm and stuff, guys, I
actually don't have a lot of
information. I think Walmart would be
the place to go, but I think some of my
mods in the chat know the answers. So,
this this is worth repeating. any
questions that I'm not answering
answering. Do I have a list now? Uh,
look for the blue names in the chat
because they're answering questions as
well. Uh, when should I call my credit
card about Best Buy to get the Switch?
They don't think it's problem. Right
now, as soon as possible. Just let them
know for the next 24 hours. You could be
making a big
purchase. Uh, the realest ever. Will
they put money back when using Apple
Pay? They'll do a pending authorization
and then at some point they'll they'll
put the money back. Uh, genuinely
terrified. Hope it'll be better than the
PS5 for sure. That that I that I I
really believe. Um, should I go for the
Best Buy bundle with the normal Switch 2
and Pro Controller? Love the
streams. Um, I mean any bundle that is
going to be one of the more popular
bundles. I will say that. But any bundle
probably will give you a higher chance
than just going for the console or the
standard Mario Kart
bundle. I have no info on Sam's Club.
I've got the links and you know
obviously we'll be monitoring that but I
don't really have uh any information.
John Riggs in the chat. What's up John?
You know what? When I was getting ready
for the stream I was I was thinking
about you today and I was thinking about
and al also I'm going back to Southeast
Southeast Game Exchange. I'm going to be
a special guest in July and obviously I
went there with you. So I I was thinking
about you a lot today man. Uh, thank you
for coming in the stream. And your
question, where can I get the best
cinnamon rolls? Sunflower Baker and
Cafe. That QR code right there.
Do you think it'll be worth buying the
SD card? Oh, I mentioned this earlier.
Uh, I'm waiting on the SD card. I think
the prices will go down drastically in
the next couple of years. I'm in no rush
to get
one.
Um, man, I'm glad to see you're still
doing this. You helped during CO to
pre-order my PS5. Glad to see you doing
this with the health, man. Much love.
Thank you so much, Brad. I really
appreciate that. And it was nothing that
donated the two. I appreciate you as
well. Um TF1 1945, I'm worried my lo my
local GameStop won't have enough after 3
p.m. After 3 p.m. they'll be gone. You
have to get there a few hours before
they open for sure. And then online goes
live at 11:00 a.m. EST. But yeah, 3 p.m.
would probably be all gone. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about that, man. Hopefully
then biblopile JB those seeking payment
plans. Okay, thank you for for donating
to answer a question. PayPal credit
PayPal credit chase credit card on Apple
Pay or a firm via Apple Pay
and then Outright Flame. Hey Jake, just
got back from my local GameStop. My
store has 60 units of and so it has 20
normal ones and 40 of the bundle. So
yeah, that's what we're seeing across
the board is there's twice as many Mario
Kart bundles as there is just just
Switch. I got my
PS5 because my connection was so bad.
When it tried putting me in the queue, I
was able to stop the site loading and
purchase it regularly. That happens
sometimes. Uh
with the particular queue that Sony uses
that that can happen
Oh, you have to work that day. I'm
really sorry about that, TF. Hopefully,
you're able to get it online um
tonight. You cannot use your old SD card
from your Nintendo Switch. The Switch 2
only takes uh Express Micro SD card,
which is a new technology.
Super ner nervous. Could I encourage you
a bit?
Yeah, you you've got this.
You're on the stream. I'm we're going to
be able to collectively as a community
let everyone know what website is
crashing, what one the servers are down.
So, all right, they didn't sell out yet,
but the servers are down. So, start
focusing on these ones.
You're in the right place. This is
giving you the best chances. So, take a
deep breath. I get a little anxious,
too, especially as we get closer. Um,
I'm going to have to be reminded by you
guys to take a deep breath, but that's
why we're here. Hype each other up. Get
each other's back.
Do you suggest focusing on a Mario Kart
plus Donkey Kong bundle as opposed to
just the Mario Kart bundle? I mean,
yeah. I think you would have a better
chance going for that for sure. I think
90% of people will just go for the
regular bundle or the Mario Kart bundle
and they won't go for these like weird
extra bundles that Best Buy. Like I'll
even put a poll. I mean, they might now
in this stream because I' I've said
that. Um, and thank you for the five,
Brandon. But, um, I'll put a poll on the
stream right now.
So, you guys can see, and now you guys
are savvy. You guys are in the no. So,
this poll might not be, you know, the
best, but for the casual consumer, I'm
sure they're just going for the regular,
you know, shoes that are being released
by Nintendo. Um, which are you going
for? So, you can vote in this poll right
now. Uh, we're going to
do stand alone and then we we are going
to go over Best Buy. So, we just went
over Target and Walmart. We are going to
go over Best
Buy, standalone
console, Mario Kart
bundle
bundle
with extra. All right.
Can you over website versus app versus
Best Buy? Yeah, that's what I was
saying. So, I'm about to go over that in
a couple minutes
here. So, vote in that poll. Uh YouTube
this entire stream has been yelling at
me that I I should insert an ad, but I
always I always get the chat's consent.
So, chat, are we goated? Are you guys
cool if I put in like a 30 secondond ad
real
quick? Should I wake up early for
pre-orders in store? For sure. Get there
as early as possible. I'd say 5 or 6
a.m. and you'd be pretty safe. Yo,
what's up, Matt? Thank you, Enchanted
Cloud.
Okay, guys, I'm going to do the ad real
quick, but then I'm going to go right
into Best Buy um after
that. Okay, you may or may not be seeing
an ad right now.
Um if you
aren't, then screw you because No, I'm
just kidding.
All right, ads are cool. I'm I'm just
going to wait a couple seconds here just
to make sure everyone's back so we can
go over Best Buy
together. And if we can get up to 2,000
uh likes on stream, that would be
awesome. YouTube Premium for the
win. Oh, look at the chat is being
spammed with premium users. Love to see.
Wow, there's a lot of YouTube Premium
users. That's crazy.
Best. I have YouTube premiums as well. I
have like this weird thing. Yeah, John
Riggs is in the stream. Ah, John, did
you respond to me when I was telling the
story about how I was thinking of you
today and I didn't see it in the chat
cuz it's too much. I appreciate you,
John.
Um, so there's a DK Bonanza bundle on
Best Buy. Uh, because you'll just pick
up separately. You'll pick up the Switch
and Mario Kart when those come out and
then you pick up DK in July. It's just
like as as if you pre-ordered two
different things from from Best Buy.
I just wanted to say hi, Mom.
All right, so let's take a look at this
poll. And
don't don't make that dirty, chat. No
one clip
this and about me talking about the poll
in a weird way.
So 14% of you are going to get the
standalone console and 67% are going to
get for the Mario Kart bundle. So the
the standalone console with this chat
might be easier to get, but overall I
don't I don't think
so. But yeah, only 18% of you are going
to get the bundle with extras. And
that's after I just told you what an
advantage that would be. So think about
the casual consumer. No one's really
going to go for that. I'm I'm sure nine
out of 10 people are not going to go for
the bundle with extras.
That's that's something to consider for
sure. And honestly, now that I'm seeing
the poll results, I'm like, hm, maybe I
should look at these
bundles cuz Best Buy's Q system sucks.
So, if you're going something that's
going to be in less demand, it might be
really
helpful. Uh, let's see.
You don't really need to upgrade your
monitor or TV for the Switch,
too. Um, if Polar P. Stop it. Stop it,
Bobby. What if I have to pee while
waiting at GameStop? So, the best way
for bathroom breaks if you're going to
camp out is to have friends like come
and like set times where your friend is
going to come for a few minutes to let
you do that, to tag out. That's the best
way to do it.
Or if you go with a friend and you're
both trying to pre-order one, if one of
you has to go to the bathroom, the other
one covers your spot. Or make friends in
line and then cover your friend in line.
You'll be each other's bathroom buddies.
Not like that, chat. Stop it. All right.
Keep your phone ready for the in
inevitable Best Buy two factor. Yes. So
yeah, let's let's let's dive into Best
Buy. All right. You guys were You guys
were
cool. You watched my ad. You liked the
stream. Well, 40% of you liked the
stream. Um, I know making multiple
pre-orders can be useful in the case one
gets canceled. If you secure two, how
long until it's safe to cancel the
other? Honestly, I wouldn't cancel one
until you get shipping confirmation
from. If you're doing pickup in store,
it's probably safe to cancel any other
ones. If you're if you're picking up in
store, if you're getting like Walmart
where it's shipping to home and let's
say you get shipped to home from Target,
I wouldn't cancel either of them until
one of them actually
ships. All right, we hit 2,000 likes, so
I'm I'm getting into Best
Buy. Yo, happy console gamer. Good luck
tonight, brother.
I don't know if you guys know uh you
know Johnny, but I don't know I don't
know if Kim's with you or or not, but
good luck to both of you guys. I don't I
don't know if you're going to get one
switch to to share to start or or how
you're going to do it, but good luck you
guys.
Actually, when I had like less less than
a I had like a few hundred subscribers,
I made a video about Johnny. Um, just
because they were having some some hard
times with uh with with Kim's pregnancy.
It was it was a scary situation and it
it really as someone with my own medical
issues, it really got to me. So, h it's
it's so nice to see you here. That
really makes me happy.
Um, can you be more in more than one
queue per retailer per
comp?
Um, I'm not sure uh what you mean by
that question, but you can certainly be
in cues for every retailer for sure. You
actually for Best Buy and Walmart, you
don't want to have multiple browsers to
be in cues uh the way theirs work. So, a
lot of the times when people try to have
multiple browsers to get extra places in
line for Best Buy, it actually hurts
you. There's something on Best Buy's
back end that can detect that and just
won't ever let you through. So, it's
better just to try on the website or the
app. Um, and just when it says please
wait, which I'm about to explain, just
wait. Don't don't do anything else.
Okay,
so real quick, let let's go over Best
Buy now that I've said that like 18
times. How Best Buy works is, like I
said, decide what you want within the
next hour or so. Think about it.
Obviously, I think these bundles will be
easier to get than just the standalone
SKs, but whichever one you decide to
get,
um I really feel like there's going to
be the least amount of hype for like the
Street Fighter bundle. So, that might be
a good one cuz it's only an extra $100.
And if if you like Street Fighter 6,
it's a nice little
bundle. Walmart shipping is reliable.
They have a deal right now to make sure
you get it by 9:00 a.m. at launch day.
So, how here's how it's going to work
for Best Buy, you guys. At 11:59
Eastern, you're going to start
refreshing Best
Buy. Basically, what you're looking for
when you're refreshing Best Buy is this
coming soon to turn into a yellow add to
cart. Unlike Walmart, Best Buy won't
throw you right in the queue. So, you do
have to be aware that while you're
refreshing, you're waiting for this gray
bar to turn yellow. As soon as it does,
you're going to click add to cart. And
then it's going to say, "This is a high
demand item." So, we're placing you in a
line. Please wait. At that point, do
what it says. You could be waiting 5,
10, 15 minutes. Don't refresh. Don't try
to like go through a different browser.
Just let it wait. And if you don't end
up getting through the queue, you didn't
do anything wrong. Best Buy can just be
kind of annoying like that. That's why
you're going to be going for Walmart and
Target at the same time. But what
happens is if it you are lucky enough to
get through the queue and the please
wait goes
away. Then you can add to cart and then
you're going to select what store you
want to pick up from. So see right here
I have my store set to a store. Make
sure you have a home store because
that's what it will default to. But if
they are already all claimed at that
store, you can choose a different
store. And for Best Buy in
particular, they will sell out and then
a few minutes later, it might when you
finally get to add to cart, it might say
there's none in stock within 200 miles
of you. But if you keep changing the
store, that refreshes it without
refreshing the page. So that's what you
want to do. You don't want to refresh
the page once it's in your cart. You
just want to keep trying different
stores even if it says that it's not in
stock because that refreshes it like on
the back end kind of. So just keep
choosing different stores and every few
minutes it'll come back into stock in
all the stores and that's when you go to
check out. So typically what happens
with Best Buy is when you first get
through people like it lets you add to
cart and then people get stuck there and
they don't check out and they think it's
sold out. But it's on the second wave of
restocks where once you already have it
in your cart and you're at that process
of just changing
stores, that's when you're actually able
to get a store selected and check
out. It is super annoying. If you're
like listening to this and you're like,
seriously, I have to go through all this
now. You can see why I'm not really a
fan. You know what? You know what I'm
saying?
But the good news is it's less than what
it sounds like because literally you're
just refreshing the page and then as
soon as it says yellow add to cart, you
click add to cart and then it's going to
say please wait. Do you think the bundle
you're going to be doing the same thing
Walmart except when you're refreshing on
Walmart as soon as it works you're in
the
queue and
then while those are waiting you can see
both of them. You'll be refreshing
constantly and actively trying to add
the cart on
target. Does that make sense?
It might sound It might sound like a
lot.
It kind of is to explain if you haven't
seen it, but I promise if you were
paying attention to what I said, when it
gets to midnight, you'll see exactly
what I mean. Like it'll it'll be clear.
I'm a visual learner as well.
Uh, it's kind of bad to refresh on all
of them, but especially Walmart. Heck is
amazing.
Yes, they have launch day pickup.
I would say best chance is Walmart and
then Best Buy and Target are kind of
tied. You should start refreshing. So,
as soon as we get to
11:59, wait 30 seconds. Just count in
your head. It doesn't have to be exact
cuz really you want to wait till like 15
seconds before. But so guesstimate 30
seconds after 11:59 and then just start
refreshing like this.
Like I said, be on the bundle that you
want for Best Buy. Be on the product
page of what you're trying to buy at all
the
retailers. Um TMTNYC, thank you for the
five help. Which stores in Brooklyn
should I drive to for inerson
pre-orders? GameStop is the only one
doing inerson pre-orders. Uh, I would
get there. I mean, if you're in
Brooklyn, I would get there like maybe
it's tough to say. There's no guarantee.
The earlier you can get there, the
better. I want you to be safe. If you're
in a neighborhood like Brooklyn,
depending on where it is, but I I I
mean, for safety concerns, I would say
maybe 6:00 a.m.
If you're in the queue on Walmart, are
you guaranteed to get one? No, you're
not guaranteed to get one anywhere.
If you were guaranteed to get one, I
don't we wouldn't we wouldn't be here,
right? Um, how do you you do Best Buy on
PC and phone at the same time? Yes, you
can, but just don't open additional
browsers for Best Buy or Walmart to try
to get extra places in the queue cuz it
doesn't work the same way that other
cues
work. Um, let's see. People are saying
that lines are forming at Best
[Music]
Buy. We often get spam of
Oh, that's awesome. El We also get
spammed like fake information because
people want attention. So, just
uh so I'm going to hold off on that. But
Elbot just shared some great
information. If you want to practice the
Best Buy
Q, Labora Times just posted a link in
the chat um for a graphics card, which
obviously you don't want to buy it, but
if you want to see how the queue works,
you can click on that link. You cannot
refresh the product page on mobile apps.
That's why I say to be refreshing the
website and as soon as
um the
website
updates Oh, weird. Your link didn't work
for me. How about
as soon as the website updates?
That's when you go into the app.
When does the Star Wars cookie menu came
out? Oh, it's already out. Um, yeah, if
you click the link in the description,
my bakery, uh, we're doing Star Wars day
stuff. Um, we posted the menu on our
page, so you got your It's not at the
top right now, but if you scroll down,
it's out there. Thank you for that, Star
Wars addict. Yeah, if you guys are local
to
like Nasha area of New Hampshire,
um, and you want to you want to order
something from my bakery, you can check
out you can check out my bakery in the
description, and you can awake and you
can DM me on Twitter to place an order.
All right, let me grab Philip real
quick.
All right, I uh we have a special guest
today. I don't know if you want to be
on. We got Britney. Yes, the co-owner of
the bakery.
Phil was freaking
out. What do you do?
Like Oh, no. It's okay. Oh, you're
not
sure. What kind of dog? He is a
long-haired Chihuahua.
What? No. No. Here, I'll
make sense. focus on multiple switches
on Yeah, Phil's still around.
Phil, does it make sense to focus on
multiple switches on Best Buy? No, I
would pick which bundle you want and
just have that one ready. Commit. Commit
to
one. Yeah. The person that says there's
a line uh forming at their Best
Buy, it's the same person that keeps
spamming it. Yeah. Let's go Celtics,
baby. Close up on
[Music]
Phil. Do we have multiple Walmart tabs?
Um, no, you shouldn't. Just one tab and
then the app.
Bye, chat. Actually, I'm not leaving.
All right. Love you.
Uh, just to be clear, you're saying do
not use multiple browsers for Walmart
and Best Buy. Correct. That is Yes, that
is what I'm
saying. That actually hurts your chances
because their website detects that. It's
weird. Yeah. What's up, Matt? It's good
to see you,
man. Go
gang. Can you explain GameStop? So, I'm
not going to be explaining GameStop
today, but there's a video in the
description that explains GameStop if
you want to check that out. I'm going to
be live streaming again tomorrow and
it's going to be all about GameStop
because GameStop's not going live
tonight. They're going live tomorrow.
[Music]
model will potentially be
okay.
Thank
you. Uh, do you think I should use my
MacBook for Apple Pay or PC with PayPal?
My only problem is MacBook is Safari
Auto School to the top when I refresh.
Honestly, if you've got both, why not be
trying on both? If you have multiple PCs
like that, multiple devices that you can
do, you just don't want to use multiple
browsers on the same device.
Just so it's clear for chat, Windows
verse tabs,
uh, tabs wouldn't do anything to help
you either way, but I think you should
just have one window open for Best Buy
and one for Walmart. I've got multiple
here. For Target, you could have
multiple. doesn't give you an advantage
or a disadvantage, but having more than
one like window
open for Best Buy or Walmart could. And
obviously this I'm doing it for science,
so I don't I don't care if I get blocked
for refreshing too much. I don't care,
you know, whatever. But for you, you
should do what I said, which is wait
till 11:59 and then start
refreshing. This is a midnight
pre-order. It's not a release. The
release date is June 5th, but it is a
midnight pre-order. midnight Eastern
time. Um, I don't see the Switch 2 dock
on the accessories from Walmart. Uh,
would I be okay to go to my local
GameStop as soon as doors open to secure
Switch 2? You would have to get there.
There's probably going to be a line, so
you're probably going to have to get
there a few hours before they open to be
safe. They GameStops don't have as many
as people thought they were going to
have. For example, I'm 45 minutes away
from Boston. My GameStop has 60
64. Any advice for buying it on the app?
Walmart specifically? try to do on the
site, but it sends me to the app
directly, which Oh, because you're do if
you're doing it on your phone, then
yeah, just use the app. You would only
be using the website if you're doing it
on a computer. And thank you for that
that super chat,
nerds. And the last super chat was Billy
Madden. Oh, Jake, I'm the guy that
helped you watch the Jake Paul fight
when when Netflix wasn't working. The
Oh, the Jake Paul Mike Tyson fight.
Yeah. Thanks for all you do. Hey, I
appreciate you, man.
Yo, the background music is starting to
get
weird. We're basically hoping for a good
spot in line. Yeah, exactly. And it's
it's random. It's it's like a lottery,
you know what I mean?
So, you want to be refreshing, but as
soon as the page updates and you're in
line, there's nothing else you can do.
At that point, we're all waiting
together.
Only
only the best buy app will use PayPal
for me.
Um, well, if so, the way you can test
that, uh, I, you know, off the top of my
head, I can't remember if if if that's a
thing that the website wouldn't let you
use PayPal, but just add something to
your cart and go to check out. just a
random cheap item. Don't don't buy it.
Just go to checkout. You can do that
anywhere to see if it's going to take
PayPal. Uh do you find it odd the other
bundles on Best Buy have no release
date? Like the Donkey Kong has no
release date? Uh no, I I don't. That's
That's normal. It's just because the
items in that bundle come out on
different
times. Um what time should I go to my
local GameStop and pre-order if they
have a 100 units? I love the vids. I
would I would go I would go at 6:00 a.m.
if you could. you might get away with
8:00 a.m., but I would go 6 a.m. to be
safe. And again, I understand that going
at 6:00 a.m. if they don't open till
like noon is crazy to have to wait 6
hours. It's like almost a full workday.
But I'm just being honest with you in
what I think would be a safe bet.
All right, I'm uh just
checking what's uh what's what's going
on on Twitter. My my bad,
chat. I think most GameStops open at
11. Someone else in the chat. All
GameStops open at 12:00. There are there
are variations for opening and closing
towns for GameStops. I know it's crazy.
There's a few of them out there. There's
more than one or two GameStops in the
US. Um, I think we should log in to
PayPal also if using that method. So,
yeah, on the websites you can't save
PayPal as a payment method. Um, but
there's ways to like save, you know,
like on your password manager within
Chrome, there's ways to save PayPal
there. So, if you use PayPal before, it
should be there. And if you haven't,
just go through the process of buying
something with PayPal and then at the
last second, don't actually press order,
but just do that to get your PayPal
information. See,
the most important place for using
PayPal or Apple Pay is Target because
Target's not a Q system. Walmart
technically lets you hold it in your
cart for 10 minutes. Best Buy, not so
much. So that's kind of similar to
target as well. Would be overkill to
clear cookies right now and log back in
everywhere.
Um I mean wouldn't hurt I I wouldn't I
wouldn't say that everyone needs to do
that at all, but if if you feel like it
it I mean it wouldn't do anything
negative.
It might be overkill, but it wouldn't do
anything
bad. Um thank you for that Davis car and
then crazy. Appreciate you boss. First
time gunning for this midnight drop.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Thank you for the 10, man. Dude, it it
blows my mind that people are like
donating
five, 10, whatever. I mean, some of the
donations been nuts, but any amount of
money just to say, you know, thank you,
appreciate you, or or good luck
everyone. So, thank you, Anime Girl9. I
I remember your your last one. Um Jake,
one more question. So, I want to try to
get mine from Target, but I'm willing to
get wherever available. Should I focus
on Target or maybe try Best Buy at the
same time? So So yeah, it's been a
minute since I went over this. So I'm
going to go over the the the grand
strategy
again. Walmart and Best Buy both use a Q
system, meaning when you start
refreshing at 11:59, as soon as you're
in the queue, which is just like a
waiting page basically where if you're
lucky, they'll select you to buy it, you
can stop focusing on Best Buy and
Walmart and then just start focusing on
Target.
If you Google auto refresher
uh on Chrome, you can add an extension,
which is what I'm going to be using on
stream. I have easy auto refreshes. So,
if you just Google that, you can see
right here I can refresh every 15
seconds. Boom. That way you can have
Best Buy and Walmart auto refreshing and
you can be focusing at Target right
away. Does that make sense?
Uh, the GameStop I'm going to is in a
mall which opens at 9:00 a.m. and the
store opens at 10:00 a.m. I'm almost
certain they're not going to let anyone
camp
outside. Um,
yeah. So, it depends like what kind of
area it is, but I mean, if it's a public
easement,
unless unless you're asked to leave uh
like by
security, it's it's not illegal for you
to be there. So, it does depend.
Obviously, you're not going to be able
to be inside the mall, but that's that's
a tricky one. Um, I would drive by at
like 6:00 a.m. and just scope out the
scene. And if you see people lining up
at a certain
entrance, you know, be aware of that.
But the mall stuff is really, really
tricky. And I I would be interested to
know if anyone in chat has dealt with
this cuz that is a niche situation that
I'm not actually sure of.
Door purchase limit is one. One per
person, one per address. Even if you
have roommates, it's if you're getting
it shipped somewhere. If you try to get
the same address shipped more than one
from a certain
retailer, that's a great way to
potentially get cancelled. You might get
lucky, you might not. But if you have
kids or multiple people in your
household that need one, you're going to
want to go for a different retailer
each. And the reason for that is there's
just not enough. So Nintendo's thing is
you're going to have to share to start
until there's more stock.
Obviously, if you get one per retailer,
that's that's the only thing you can
really do.
Yeah, Target absolutely accepts PayPal.
That's for sure. Like I said, you can't
save it to your payment methods. You can
only use PayPal to pay at Target when
you have something in your cart and you
go to check out.
All right,
chat. I'm having fun.
I'm definitely going to lose my voice
tomorrow,
but I think I need a a
quick just resting of the vocal cords.
Uh, the stream is crazy. We're
definitely going to be trending on
YouTube. and how trending we will be.
Uh, one thing you can do to help that is
by liking the
stream. The likes themselves won't help
the stream trend, but it will help
promote it in the
out. Uh, don't forget to hydrate. Yeah,
I got my water
right. Funny, this shirt on camera kind
of looks like the static on like a TV
set, like an old CRT.
What if I met criteria with Nintendo and
got the email? Well, the emails don't
come out till May 8th, so you will have
no idea, but Nintendo's already openly
stated they will not have enough to to
get to let everyone that meets the
criteria get one. They announced that
today for Japan. Obviously, there's a
lot more dep demand in the US than
Japan. Can you repeat the auto refresh
thing again? Yeah, if you just Google
easy auto refes extension, you can
install it to your Chrome, which is what
I'm using right now, and then you click
it right there. And then you type how
many what interval in seconds you want
it to reset. So there, I'm going to have
it refresh every 20 seconds. Now doing
that
automatically. I just answered the
Nintendo lottery. That's what I was
talking
about. Does the Walmart Q reset if you
refresh? No, it shouldn't. It shouldn't
hurt you or help you if you're
refreshing. So, if you refresh I I guess
what you're asking is if you refresh one
too many times on Walmart, is that going
to kick you out or screw you over? No.
So, if you've got your your auto refresh
on Walmart, you don't have to worry
about it refreshing too many times.
Yeah. App can't refresh at all. That's
why you refresh on the websites and as
soon as the websites let you in, have
the app ready and then click the product
as soon as the website shows that it's
live.
Amazing man, you're a legend. Oh, thank
you so much. Uh, Penguini,
Penguiny, I guess that would make more
sense.
Stream started already. Yes, the stream
has started an hour and a half ago, I
believe.
All right. Look at Brit. She's the best.
She got me
a sugarfree. He knows I'm trying to
watch that
Red Bull energy drink.
I love that
girl. All right. The help you give and
the joy you bring to everyone is
invaluable. Thanks for all you've done
for me and others. Finger guns forever.
Yo, Eevee on the TV, you are an OG and I
appreciate you so much.
Um, I worldrenowned. I think you missed
my last super about Best Buy bundles. I
am so sorry about
that. I'm kicking myself.
Um, I've added you as a mod
temporarily. Um, so you can reask that
question.
Worldrenowned. Uh, Bangao. So, just so
you know, guys, I I'm not like saying
you have to donate more, but if you
donate uh less than $5, it doesn't pop
up. See how like the $5 donations are on
the chat so I can click them and go
back. But the blue ones, which I think
are the ones that are less than five,
they don't pop up there. So, I miss
those sometimes, and I don't mean to.
Um, is it okay to do virtual machines
with different accounts for Walmart?
Also, should I have both Walmart pages
open for the system in the Mario Kart
bundle? Good question, Angababanga. So,
that is something you can do. Uh, if you
create multiple accounts for Walmart,
this is very cumbersome, but if you
create multiple accounts for Walmart and
you're logged in to a different account
on different browsers, then yes,
technically you can get multiple places
in line that way. So, if you really are
focusing on Walmart and you're not going
for all three, that is something you
could do is create multiple accounts and
then be signed into a different one on
like Chrome,
Firefox, Edge,
whatever, and then those would all get
their own chance. But you can only have
one app open unless you have multiple
phones. So, that is the only workaround
where that would that would work for
one. Um, and that's smart of you to
think of that. So, how do I deal with
accessories at checkout? Should I just
focus on getting the main Switch bundle
first? That's what I've been saying
tonight is I think you just got to make
sure you secure the console first. Um,
and then go back. You know what I mean?
It's like if you're on an airplane and
there's a emergency, you secure your own
mask and then you help the other
passengers, right?
Uh, Wild Raven Feathers. I'll be sure to
pay um a visit to Sunflower Bakery the
next time I'm in Nshawa. Yo, thank you
so
much. Just FYI, we do not have a
storefront yet, but we will be at the
Milford, New Hampshire Farmers Market
every Saturday from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00
p.m. So, if you want to visit my bakery,
you can visit me at the Milford, New
Hampshire Farmers Market Saturdays, uh,
starting first or second week of June.
Um,
oh, Britney uh just texted me that
there's a camper at my local GameStop
already.
My fiance and I want to do both the
midnight launch at Best Buy and we live
at the same address. Will Best Buy
cancel our orders even if we're picking
up in stores? So, because you're not
getting shipping, right? You're doing
instore pickup. As long as you use
different payment methods and you're
using a different account, you're not
using the same Best Buy account, then
you should be fine because how would
Best Buy know, right?
They're not actually shipping you
anything.
Um, can we get two spots? That's a great
question though. Thank you. I'm sure
that helped other people. Can we get two
spots if we're on mobile and computer
for Walmart? Yes. And you absolutely
want to do that, Chunky. So, for
Walmart, uh, once you refresh the
website and you get put in line in the
queue, then click whatever product
you're trying to buy from Walmart on the
app as well, and you'll get a different
place in line for each of those.
Um,
what if you have multiple computers and
the same account?
Um, since it's a completely different
device, that might work as well. If
you're using completely different
devices for Walmart, you might get more
than one because that's how it works,
right? If you're on a phone and you're
on a computer, they get different
places. So, I I think that it would work
where if you're on multiple computers,
it would do the same thing. That that
was what makes sense, right? Um, thank
you, Jake. You're big help with
everything. Hope everyone gets their
system. Yo, thank you so much, Vinnie.
And that last one was Cameron Krishnner.
And then, worldrenowned. I'm I'm gonna
be looking for you in a second. Hey
Jake, can you save pay um PayPal as
payment for Best Buy
Walmart and do a separate edge and
Chrome Q on the same PC? Let's secure
the bag. You got me three PS5s in the
pack. Yo, thank you so much. Um you
can't save PayPal as a payment method
anywhere. You have to just go through
and then when you go to checkout, that's
when it lets you
use. Uh what's the best strat to
prioritize target pickup? So, one thing
that I wanted to talk about is because
it's pre-orders, I think Target's going
to have in store pickup, but they're a
little weird with pre-orders and
sometimes it can be different. So, it
might be all shipping for Target and
it's just because of the way their back
end works. They don't
have the consoles at the stores now.
They might not have it. So, I just want
to put it on your radar. I think they're
going to have in store at Target, but I
just want to put on your radar in case
you're adjusting on the fly. If you go
and it's not letting you do in store
pickup, just try to get shipping at
that.
Don't get held up. Take whatever you can
get. You know what I mean?
Best Buy won't let me update my payments
method. Um, I'm not sure why that is. I
I literally did it before stream and it
worked no problem. You just go to your
account, go to payment methods.
Um, you might have too many saved, in
which case you would want to remove some
and then add a new payment method.
That's the only thing I can think of.
Pre-orders is not all shipping. It's
already been confirmed to have instore
pickup at Best Buy. As a matter of fact,
Best Buy might not be doing
um GameStop is doing shipping. Walmart
is doing shipping. GameStop is doing in
store only if you pre-order in person.
So, Target is the only one that also
might do instore pickup. GameStop is
conf I mean, Best Buy is confirmed to do
in store
pickup. If I get it uh in the cart on my
computer at Walmart or Best Buy, can I
open my app and check out there instead?
Ah, you were watching my videos. Thank
you, Mario Carter. Yes. So, that is the
other trick. If you're trying, if the
websites are being really bad and not
loading and somehow you manage to get it
in your cart, either on the app or on
the website, either one of them, but
then it stops working, you can go to
just your cart. Like say I just added
this, I just added a switch to my cart
on Target,
right? Instead of trying to add it to my
cart on the website, I know I got it in
my cart on the app. I just click the
little cart icon and it will be there
and then I check out. So that is
absolutely a trick that can come in
clutch. And again, when it comes time
for pre-orders, if a little trick like
that is working, I'm going to let you
know. I'm going to be like, "Okay, guys,
try this if you're struggling here,
right?" So these little tricks, it's
good to know ahead of time. I'm glad
we're talking about it, but I'll also
let you know so we can adapt on the fly.
Um,
but yeah, Mario, great great quick great
great question. If you guys have time,
if you want to go and watch my videos
that actually bring up the the web pages
and show you the step-by-step guide,
they're about six minutes each. I have
one for GameStop, I have one for
Walmart, um, I have one for Best Buy,
and I have one for Target. They were
made when the PS5 was hard to get, so
they're a little dated, but the tips
still work really well. And they're
linked in the description of this live
stream, so you have some time if you
want to check those out and come back. I
wouldn't blame
you. I think the Mario Kart bundle will
be easier to get because stores have
twice as many Mario Kart bundles as they
do standalone consoles.
All right. So, let me um let me just
check Twitter X real quick. See what's
been going on there since I've been
ignoring
it. Oh, nice. Elvot's been sharing to
tips which
uh which I
love. So,
um tip to save time at Walmart, add
everything you want to your wish list.
Hold on. I I'm going to show you guys
by clicking um the heart icon. You can
do this
now. And then if you go to your
favorites page, you can add anything
that's available to the cart with one
button when things are live. So you're
going to click this little heart and
then if you go to your favorites when it
comes time, you can add stuff to your
cart there. And that's something you can
do
um if the queue isn't loading or we've
gotten past the
queue. You can do the same for target.
And target is going to be a lot more
helpful because there's no queue.
So yeah, let me show you on target cuz
that's that's a really clutch tip for
target.
Uh the heart is harder to find. It's
right here.
And then if you're not able to get the
add to cart to show here, just go to
your favorites and then click add to
cart from
there. Yeah, it's all right to use two
devices for the same site and I I
recommend
it. So, you will get charged a pending
authorization now. So, if you don't have
the full amount in your bank account
right now, you'll your pre-order will
get
blocked, but they're not actually
charging you. They'll give you the money
back. Oh, World Renowned, I I see you
now. That could actually
work. Uh, if you want to ask your
question again, World Renowned, I'm I'm
looking for
you. They are leading the pack once
more. I'm I'm trying.
Welcome all the new subscribers in
addition to all the returning OGs
because we've I think we've gotten like
a thousand subscribers on stream
tonight. 1 th00and new
subscribers. Uh so welcome welcome to
the
madness. It's crazy. So I started
streaming almost two hours ago. Now we
only have an hour and a half to
go. This is crazy.
What? What's
up? All right, we are halfway to our
like goal of 5,000 likes
tonight. I know I'm kind of annoying and
I and I ask you to like the stream
sometimes, so I try not to do it too
often,
but maybe. All right, that is annoying.
Um, for Best Buy, do you suggest picking
up one of the more obscure bundles? Oh,
I I think I did read your question.
Maybe you didn't hear me. I' I've
answered this a few times. Um, but it's
about time for a reminder. I'm sure
there's a lot of people that that didn't
hear my answer. Um, yes. So, the obscure
bundles, I literally ran a poll in chat
to see who's going for just the Switch,
who's going for the Mario Kart, and
who's going for one of the obscure
bundles. And very few people are going
for the obscure bundles. So, you want to
go for one of
those. Um, I like I might go for this
one to be honest. Who the heck is going
to want to get the wheels? It's an extra
25
bucks and no one's going to be going for
this. You know what I mean? So, yeah, I
think that'll give you an advantage. Uh,
Soul Wielder, thank you so much for the
two.
Jake, help me get the PS5 Spider-Man 2
limited edition. Hey, what's up? Welcome
back. Thank you for becoming a member as
well, soul wielder. And then storm mage.
Should I wait in the item page to
refresh or wait? You you do have to
refresh. I think I've settled on one of
the bundles. Uh that's why I'm making
sure. Elbot. I'm going for the bundle
with Madden 21 and Far
Cry. Best Buy just had Far Cry 6 on sale
for like five bucks the other day. So I
bought three of them. I don't even know
why that is a game that you can play
online with like with friends. So, I was
like, "All right, maybe I'll play
through this with
friends." You don't need Walmart Plus.
You don't need GameStop Pro membership.
You don't need any of that stuff for
pre-orders. Nintendo has made it very
clear to retailers that they are not to
pull that for
pre-orders. When it comes to
restocks, they'll probably pull that,
but for now, we're good. Amazon United
States is not allowed to sell any
pre-orders. They're not selling
any. That's whoever said that in the
chat. Uh Mike P, thank you for saying
that because it's been a while since I
mentioned
that. It won't refresh automatically in
the app. That's why my technique is to
refresh the websites on your computer.
And as soon as you refresh and it
updates on the computer, then you know
it's live, then you can go into the
app. That's that's a good tip. Another
tip is to have Best Buy be your longest
tab since you have to scroll down to see
the add to cart button if it's short.
And yeah, as you can see, Best Buy is my
longest tab. These ones are all square
and this is a long
boy. Uh, backup
plan ETO email if you have to camp out
GameStop. That's funny. Baby file, thank
you for that. Curtis Smith, thank you
for the five, man.
Can we order a Switch in person at
GameStop and online in the same account
for two consoles total?
Um,
honestly, you probably could if the one
that you order in person, you don't link
to the same account as the one you order
online. Can we get more finger guns? I
missed the opening hype.
All right, for those of you who are new
around here,
um, buy a separate bundle of packing
options on different windows with the
same browser for Best Buy will be a
separate queue or the same queue. Uh,
yeah, you don't want to do that. You
only you want to pick one. Don't don't
try to do that. If you try to get in the
queue line on Best Buy for more than
one, it's going to probably not let you
in either one. I know it's frustrating
and Best Buy doesn't tell you that,
which makes it twice as frustrating,
but that's that's why that's why I'm
telling you to choose the one you want
and only go for that one for
about. But uh yeah, if you guys want
some finger, we do some finger guns
around here. It's basically I do a bunch
of different camera angles and I dance,
right? Kind of what we do around
here. We did want to start the stream.
You guys want another one? I'm down to
do
it. I'm
down. I'm going to run a poll in the
chat. Finger
guns. And obviously uh we'll do finger
guns multiple times throughout the
stream. The next time we do finger guns
will be like 10 minutes before the
pre-orders
start. Yo, Mswizzle, appreciate you,
man. Britney, yeah, that's how we do it
around these parts. You're damn
right. Listen, pardon me, miss.
I don't mean to be
rude. You fart out of that thing.
Uh, my GameStop told me that for inerson
pre-orders, they're giving out pre-order
prioritization to pro members. I don't
think that's true,
Mike. Uh, I've heard that as well. I
think that's a rumor that's going
around. And I think that some GameStops
are are saying that the employees to try
to sell pro memberships, but there's no
chance if you're waiting there for six
hours, they're going to be like, "Oh,
you're not a pro member. No, none for
you."
There's no way they would get abs that
it would be horrible
PR. I can't even speak the words. It's
just so unfathomable. But thank you for
the super chat, man. And thank you for
like trying to trying to share that with
everyone. I just don't believe
it.
Um Oh, yo, Isaac, thank you. So, if you
go to an hour 1 hour and 18 minutes and
38 seconds on Jake's PS5 and Xbox
vid that's 2 hours and 38 minutes long
to see the Walmart line. You know what?
I can actually I think I can show you
guys the Walmart view. Curtis Smith. Oh,
thank you for another five, man. Um,
what do you think the resale market will
be like? What would you pay resale if
you had to? To be honest, I'm I'm not
interested. I'm just helping I'm
interested. I I hope the resell market
sucks. You know, there's always going to
be people that like FOMO. You know,
there's going to be people that try to
sell it for as much as
possible, but I say, you know
what? Like, no one can get it before
June anyways. So, don't don't buy
anything from a scalper. Don't buy
anything from
Resell until the console actually comes
out. You know what I mean? I mean, I
would say don't even buy it then, but
um there's no point like you could you
could end up getting it before June 5th.
This isn't going to be the only
pre-order. There will be multiple
chances to get it before launch day. And
it might be easier because those ones
won't be
announced.
Um,
okay. So, I think I can actually show
you how the Walmart Q works. Remember I
said I had those guides in the
description of how every retailer
works. This is kind of why uh they're
good. All right. Walmart Jake Randall.
Search that on YouTube every
day. Um, Mike, thank you for the sign.
Thanks for clarifying, Shake. I believe
you more than GameStop. You help my dad
and I get PS5s and Series X's. We're
both watching your stream right now for
the Switch 2 pre-orders. You're the
GOAT. Yo, Mike, thank you so much, dude.
I really appreciate that.
All right, guys. See See what I remember
when I said step by step? I wasn't I
wasn't joking.
Um I saw you were supposed to
refresh 3 minutes before. Should I
refresh repeatedly? Whoever said that,
don't listen to them. They don't know
what they're talking about. You want to
wait till like 30 seconds before. You
don't want to start. You'll get booted.
You'll get blocked potentially for
refreshing starting three minutes
before. Amazing help, but it's finger
gun time. Okay.
Okay. Here was the past live stream.
All right, step four. Walmart uses a Q
system at the time of the restock. Start
refreshing 30 seconds before. See, I
told you these videos were still
good. Start. That's a crazy face, by the
way. Uh, start refreshing 30 seconds
before. As soon as you were given a wait
time, stop refreshing and wait. And see
right here, you're in line for this
deal. You can click hold my spot and
keep shopping. I wouldn't. So, it says
once it's your turn, you'll have 10
minutes to check out. It's kind of hard
to see on on this screen right now, but
this is what it says. And then it gives
you an estimated wait time at the
bottom. And then you're going to see on
a past live stream what happens once you
get through
that.
Um, so right here I refresh. Boom. See
how it changed? That's what happens. So
this is kind of like what the page looks
like. See, this is why people come to my
channel. a little bit of experience. But
so this is what the page is looking like
right now, right? You're just seeing the
Switch 2 and you're seeing, you know,
this little blue bar even. This is all
what it looks like right now on Walmart.
And so 30 seconds before midnight
Eastern, you're going to start
refreshing and then boom, right there.
Once it changes to that, you're done.
That's all you have to do at that point.
You just wait.
like the stream
people.
Okay. Can't see the minimize. Okay. So,
we're going to do some finger
guns. If you want a link for this video,
it's in the description, but I'll I'll
put it in the
chat. Yeah, this is for United States
only.
But I'm going to hit you guys with an ad
because I feel like I've earned it. And
then we're going to do finger guns and
it's going to be awesome. Uh, when will
retailers combat bots? It seems they
don't care. I failed trying to get an
RT. I mean, they are trying. The Q
system gives you a random place in line.
So, even the bots that join instantly
might not get to go because they might
get a bad place in line. So, it's not
about how fast you are. It's all random.
So, that that is them trying to combat
the boss. Thank you for the time,
Joshua. But yeah, there's just not
enough product to meet the demand. So,
it's always going to be a
problem. Drink water. Thank you,
Mike. Yo, Mike, you're a you're a real
one.
Okay. All right. Real quick ad, then
we'll come back. Um, I'll show you the
Walmart queue one more time and we'll do
that hype sesh.
All right, all shout out to all the
YouTube premium people.
Oh my god, the music just started going
crazy.
Okay, there we go. That's vibes right
there. Uh, the ad just went.
Yeah, thank you guys. By the way, I I
hate It's a new thing where I I've been
putting ads in my streams at all. And
obviously when we get closer to the drop
time, there's going to be no ads. So
like as soon as we get close to
pre-orders, there's no ads for the rest
of the stream except maybe like when I'm
ending the stream. If if you guys are
homies, I'll do one. But um it is nice.
I don't really know what it does for me
in terms of monetization, but I just
assume it's good.
Um,
okay. Yo, and we're almost at 3,000
likes, by the
way. All right, let's
go. Um, hey, Elbot, could you get me the
new egg links to put in the
description? Uh, Broken 95, found out
about you from Jeff Grub's show this
morning. Thanks for all the great tips
and information. Oh, you're so
welcome. Muffin, should I two the same
site open? It really won't help
you. Just hit 3,000 likes. Let's go.
Thank you
guys. If I could give a like for every
finger
gun. What happens? You know that Mr.
Beast video where he's just like
counting to like a million or whatever
it is. What if I made a video that was
just like doing a million finger guns?
It was like me being
like, "What happens if I get it in my
cart on my phone for Walmart? Walmart,
you just go to checkout. So, what's
awesome about Walmart is it gives you 10
minutes. So, it's unlike Best Buy and
Target where it's crazy, you actually
have time to
breathe. That's that's one of the
reasons why I'm going for Walmart. I'm
going for all three, but I'm
prioritizing
one. Can Best Buy be up on a phone,
tablet, PC, and laptop? For sure, you
can do it on all
devices. Thank you, Elbot.
All right, guys. You have voted. How
many votes did we
get? 2,000 people voted and 82% of you
want the finger
guns. All right, Daniel, thank you so
much for the 10. Jake, thanks for doing
the stream and helping us out. Which
Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games are
you most looking forward to? I'm
personally looking forward to Kirby
Starcross World.
Um, looking forward. Honestly, Donkey
Kong, I love DK64. I love 3D
platformers. I'm playing through
Astrobot right now. I know I'm late. Um,
but yeah, Donkey Kong for sure for me of
what's announced so far. But I'm excited
for Mario Kart, of course. I'll be
playing that all day. I'll probably
stream it. I'll probably play with
viewers. All right, guys. So, right now,
there's a pause in the Q&A section of
the stream to do a hype sesh.
And if you don't know what that means or
what that is, well, don't worry, cuz
you're about to find
out. We will be back to regularly
scheduled programming in 5
minutes. I know it looks like I'm taking
a break, but I'm still going to be
talking. But we'll be back to regularly
stream in 5 minutes.
Uh, don't set an auto refresher till you
get to one minute before, but I would do
or like 30 seconds before, but then at
that point I would do like every two
seconds.
Everyone, we are 1 hour and 19 minutes
away.
[Music]
from the
time you are here and you are
prepared. You do not have to be anxious.
You are here to secure the bag. You are
going to confirm the switch to pre-order
with us
tonight. And if you don't, I'll stream
every single pre-order that comes
between now and June. I will stream 12
hours straight on launch day. I'm not
going anywhere. It is my job to help you
secure the
bag. So, secure these finger guns.
[Music]
Hey,
hey, hey.
[Music]
Let's go. I voted no, but I regret that.
That's what I'm talking about. Wake up.
I know it's cringe, but it's fun.
[Music]
Dude, John Morant loves my streams.
[Music]
Heat. Heat.
[Music]
Heat. Heat.
[Music]
That's what I'm talking
about. That is the Drake Randall
experience. And I'm out of breath. All
right. Water. I know.
Don't scold me,
chat. The Jarant comment was diabolical.
I didn't know if you guys could really
hear me when the music plays
almost. Press like if you're getting a
switch too tonight, baby. Hit that like
button for good luck. Not going to lie,
I get in my element when I when I do the
hype sessions.
Check me out.
Onlyfans.com/2inch
destroyer. Don't make fun of me for
that. Did you hear? It's destroyer.
Okay. It's not It's not 2 in little wimp
boy. All
right. Yo, Budapestto, thank you so
much. Jake, I'm so excited that I found
your channel. What you do is amazing and
your backstory was so touching. It
really hit home for me. Hope this helps
and keep being you. Happy to a new
subscriber also. Hello chat, dude. Thank
you so much. What a sweet message and
did not have to donate, but I really
appreciate that.
Careful, bro. My girls on the stream.
Yes, Toadar. You can join the Walmart
queue on both your phone and your
computer.
Even if the Switch 2 is a boss banger
guns for the win. I appreciate you,
Bill. And I saw you tell me to get to
the hype sesh. I appreciate you, man.
Jake, you're I got a PS5. Let's go.
Thank you, Twink.
I'm back. Just got off of work. So
ready. Let's go, Matthew
Williams. I didn't even know you left,
man.
Budapest though, that that that super
chat made my night. I don't know if
Alyssa is still here, but I'm obviously
Alyssa, I really appreciated your super
chat as
well. Oh, Billy, thank you for those
links, guys. I got to add some links to
the description. Where'd I get that nice
shirt? Thank you for the five. I get it.
I got it at
Pacson. I get all my stuff at
Pson. I don't know if that's basic or
not. Hoping to get a pre-order through
Walmart tonight. You helped me get the
30th anniversary dual sense. You rock,
dude. Hey, thank you Brandon or Braden.
Braden, sorry about that.
Can you please tell me when I can
pre-order the Nintendo Switch 2 Pacific
time and what website? So, all the links
are in the description so you can get it
at 900 p.m. tonight Pacific time at Best
Buy,
Target, or
Walmart. Why not buy it directly from
the Nintendo website? Uh to buy it
directly from Nintendo.
Um you have to
uh register and you'll maybe get
selected, but they won't email you till
May 8th. So Nintendo's not selling it
tonight. You'll get an email in two
weeks from now. Maybe buy it from
Nintendo. That that's why we're going
for the retailers tonight. What is the
siren alarm we should be listening for?
I'm about to do that. And then Aqua, can
you shout our boy Mr. Okay, Levi just
did, sir. Thank you for that. So, guys,
this is going to be a test. Um, I don't
know if I should do an alarm. I have the
alarm ready, but typically I don't do an
alarm just because when we know exactly
what the time is. It's going to be
midnight, right? But I guess for old
time sake, we can do an alarm. Um, so
this is a test. But at midnight, I guess
in case you're like drifting off or you
have me on in the background, this is
going to be the
sound. Okay, so that was the
test. Uh that's is what will happen. Um
so you'll for sure hear that.
Uh Marky, thank you for the toe, bro.
I'm scared. Is Best Buy not doing the 10
minutes?
Uh, I mean, they're doing the same queue
as always. I'm not sure what you mean by
the by the 10 minutes.
Um, I appreciate you though, Marky. And
then Cosmic Haven, is there any cues I
should look out for tonight?
Uh, not not in particular. Uh, we'll
I'll keep going over some stuff, but um,
just tune into the stream and I'll I'll
help you adjust on the fly um depending
on how the websites are responding.
And then Milton, good to see you, man.
Thank you so much for the 10. Appreciate
you,
brother. Uh, thanks for the stream,
Jake. Saw you on Giant Bomb. And this is
so much better than doing the silent and
alone. I appreciate you. Yeah. No, I
appreciate that. That's what I get from
a lot of people. Like the tips are
helpful. Like helping calm you guys
down. Uh, people find helpful, but also
just not having to do it by yourself and
just be wondering. Oh, the 10-minute
waves for Best Buy. Yeah. Yes, I did
talk about that earlier. I didn't call
them 10-minute waves, but I said that
you should be changing your store
frequently if it's telling you that it's
out of stock once you get it in your
cart at Best Buy. Just keep picking
different stores for like 10 minutes
exactly like 10 minutes after. And then
if even though it's said out of stock
for 10 minutes, if you keep changing
what store you're trying to buy it from,
when the new wave comes in, all the
stores will now all of a sudden have
stock even though it said it sold. And
again, I'm going to tell you this in the
moment when it's
happening. Um, help me get the 30th Pro.
Let's get a switch, too. Hey, thank you,
Caleb. Dash114, I really appreciated
that, by the way. And then
Iro-Avo Jake, this is my daughter Ray's
first console release. She's loving your
stream. Can you tell her hi? Hi Ray,
good
luck.
Um, kind of weird about that 2 in stuff
now. Um, I'm ready on Walmart. Uh,
waiting. I tried Best Buy, but the
website kept crashing on me. Walmart
works so much better. Walmart's been
kind of crashing tonight, too. At
midnight, no one might even buy a Switch
for like 10 to 15 minutes just because
the sites are are crashing and then
people will give up about 15 minutes
after midnight. They think it's sold out
and they were too slow and that's when
it will actually start letting people
buy them. That's something that happens
a lot. So, don't give up right away.
That's why the stream will be helpful.
If they're sold out, I'll tell you. If
I'm telling you to keep trying, keep
trying.
Um Here's to Jake, the legend who scalps
the scalpers. Thank you so much for
everything you do, both scene and on
scene, and for building this incredible
community. Thank you so much, Dave. I
don't scalp anybody. I don't rip the
heads off of anyone
except the boss.
All right, that was
corny. All right, don't clip that. My
GameStop has a 50 console 30 bundle
split. No one lined up yet. I can't
secure a pre-order online. What time do
you think I should show up? Uh, I've
been telling people 6:00 a.m. if there's
no one out. I don't want people to put
themselves in danger in camping out,
depending on where your store is. Um,
and I I'm kind of hoping that 6 a.m.
will be early.
Nerdy7, I'm I'm sorry if I I missed
something you asked. W stream Jake,
thank you so much, NJ.
Um, but yeah, I appreciate you Quint
Teddy and Dave
Pota. Um, Cosmic Haven, am I going to be
able to pre-order the accessories, too?
So, I would try to get your console
first, and if you're lucky enough to get
the console, then go back and go for
accessories.
That's that, you know, people might be
trying to get the accessories right
away. So, that might end up making it so
you don't end up with accessories. You
know, being realistic, that could
happen, but you got to secure the
console, right? What What good are the
accessories without that?
Aaron 334, I didn't I didn't see
anything from you,
man. Oh, wait. I got you. Will it charge
tax/ delivery fee immediately?
Um, well, there's no delivery fee, but
yeah, it would whatever the full amount
is plus tax is going to take out of your
account right away, but it's not really
taking it out because it gives it back
to you. It's called a pending
authorization, and they will do that.
Yes. Sorry, I missed that. The blue
super chats don't stick to the top of
the chat. So, if the chat's going fast,
um, just just be aware of that. I do
really try to get them. Um, is an
instore pre-order more guaranteed than
the web? If you get there early enough,
at least you don't have to fight the
bots and deal with all the, you know,
the crashing websites and all that.
Uh, Galdo Bonia, thank you for the five.
Go Red Sox. Too bad they lost and are
not consistent. Yeah,
I go Celtics, man. Good luck getting the
switch to everybody. I appreciate you.
Appreciate you, too, Quinn
Teddy. Yeah. So, the reason I I I don't
miss if it's five or more is because
even if it happened a long time ago, I
can just click on it. see them at the
top of the chat. So, it makes it super
easy for me and I wish YouTube did that
with the the blue ones, too. It drives
me crazy.
Um, BK Tad, watch a video but need a
refresher. Which sites need to be fresh
and how? Need to know how to handle the
refresh for the sites? Okay, that's a
great question. Uh, let's just go over
that real quick. Again, I actually had
my video that shows you what happens.
So, take a look at Walmart right here.
Uh, see how it has the console and it
has like this little thing that says
it's almost time. So, that's what it
looks like now. Right at 11:59 Eastern.
Um, oh, thank you so much, Cosmic Haven.
I appreciate you.
Um, so 11:59 you're going to wait about
30 seconds and then you'll start
refreshing. or if you have an auto
refresher, which you can get by just
googling easy autoresh extension and
then downloading it and then boom. So
you'll start refreshing every every like
2 seconds. Just type in two
start. Or if you're refreshing manually,
that's fine. You can do that, too. But
then so you're going to be refreshing
like this. You can see the auto
refresher is on. I'm going to stop I'm
going to stop that. But this is what
it's going to look like when it works.
You're going to start
refreshing. And then this is a past live
stream that I that I
had. So you can see right here, I'm
refreshing. I'm
refreshing. It's Jception right now.
Boom. It changed to you are now in line.
So it went from this, which is what we
see right now. It's going to change to
this that says you're in line.
That's what you do for Walmart and then
you're done. You just wait to get
through and then as soon as it updates
on the website, you're going to do it on
your app as well for Walmart. Um Best
Buy, same thing. You're going to
refresh. Except the difference for Best
Buy is instead of automatically saying
you're in line, this gray button will
turn yellow and you'll click add to cart
and then it will put you in line. And
then for Target, there's no queue. So,
you're just going to refresh till you
get add to cart and try to just do it
the oldfashioned
way. You cannot refresh on the app.
That's why you do it on the website and
then only go into the app after you've
seen that it updates on the
website. Best Buy to send your house.
Uh,
you think okay six. Um, Aaron, so Best
Buy might do some shipping, but they're
prioritizing into storere pickup. So, I
can't guarantee they're going to do
shipping for the pre-orders. Um, but I
think they
might. So, I'm sorry I don't have a
definitive answer, but
uh, will my roommate Powder Buffet be
able to get one? Yes, they
will. Uh, Gerald Gerardo Bonia, uh, do
you know if I can order Switch 2 from
outside the US? So, people try that,
they try that from Amazon UK. Uh, some
people haven't been cancelled yet, but
they'll probably will be. Most of them
are cancelled. And like Amazon customer
service for the
UK has said that they will cancel those.
So, if it's not canceled for certain
people yet, uh, I would expect it might
be at some point, especially because
those companies don't want to deal with
like the push like getting in trouble
because of our tariff situ, right? So,
now more than ever, you're probably
going to get cancelled. Also though, you
don't want to take stock from other
people from other countries. You know,
it's going to be hard enough in every
country. Imagine if like people in
Europe were trying to pre-order all our
stock. Maybe they are, but you know what
I mean. Uh for Best Buy, if there's
nothing showing on pickup, do you still
recommend opening a new browser or
should we just
wait? Um
you don't need to open a new browser. uh
just you're overthinking it, just
refresh a bunch of times
um at 11:59 until it changes. And then
once you get the yellow add to cart,
click yellow add to cart. And then you
don't need to open any more tabs or
anything. You just it'll say please wait
and then you just wait. One more thing I
want to mention from Best Buy that you
did remind me of though is that if it
asks you to it might be like we need to
verify you're a real person. Would you
prefer an email or a text message?
Always choose the text message cuz the
email can take like 30 minutes, which
yeah, it's going to be gone. But the
text message is always instant. So if
you get that message where it's like, we
need to send you a code to confirm your
account, choose the text message every
time. Um, thank you for helping to
secure my new Pokemon machine. Pokemon
machine. Can't wait to play Legends.
Let's go. Me, too. I'm excited for
Pokemon Legends. I still like the
mainline Pokemon games more. And I'm
most excited for Donkey Kong. But I'm
excited for
Pokemon. Uh, and by mainline Pokemon
games, I mean the ones from 20 years
ago. Just got back from work. I'm so
ready. Switch two for life. Let's go,
Matt. One hour away, you guys.
If you get in a queue uh and auto
refresh keeps going, that's fine. It It
won't hurt you uh if it keeps
going. Just turn it off when you
can. But once you're in line, you're in
line. Refreshing won't give you a worse
spot and it won't give you a better
spot. Yo, Budapesto, thank you for
becoming a Jakey Gang
member. Thank you for adding me. So, I
saw that, by the way.
What if I order to switch to Heather
says, "What if I order Switch to his
Mario Kart alongside Donkey Kong
Bonanza?" Yeah, it's a common question.
Yeah, you'll be able to get the the
Switch on launch day and then you pick
up Donkey Kong separately on its launch
day. You don't have to wait till Donkey
Kong comes out to pick
everything. Um, thanks for teaching us
to be pre-order sweats. Tweets
professionals maybe is what you meant to
say. Oh, sweats. Yeah, sweats. What am I
Yeah, you're you're welcome.
Sorry, my my brain just literally
shortcircuited.
All right.
What if Best Buy says there's no pickup
stores available once you're in cart?
just keep trying to change your store
and about 10 minutes later
um
eventually the the store it'll it'll
come back in stock in all the stores
because it's basically waiting for
people to either check out or decide
they don't want it or get declined and
then it puts that stock back in the
store which happens about every 10
minutes or so. So, if it's in your cart
on Best Buy and it says out of
stock, just keep trying to change the
store and use the stream because I'll
let you know, oh, looks like Best Buy
has another wave coming. And then you
don't want to be constantly doing it for
10 minutes cuz that is a long time. Just
wait for me to be like, oh, here comes
another wave. And that's where the
stream can
helps and helps and
help. Um, we need to worry about any
complications trying both the Best Buy
app and website at the same time. Also,
love the vibes. Makes the night less
stressful.
Uh, no, you don't really need to worry
about that. I wouldn't. Honestly though,
I if unless you're only trying to get it
from Best Buy, I wouldn't use the Best
Buy app. I would prioritize using the
app to try to go for like Walmart or
Target. Will being on multiple devices
on the same network help or hurt the
Best Buy, Walmart, Q, but multiple
devices shouldn't do anything.
It could potentially help uh Walmart
specifically, but if it's multiple
devices, it shouldn't
hurt. Guys, I I need to take two seconds
to add some links to the description for
New Egg. I don't know if New Egg's going
to go live at
midnight, but I have to have to have to
um add them.
Bring more water. Yeah, I will.
Okay.
content and live
stream.
Okay, I have to
Why are you not going with the bundle?
Because I will, but I don't know if I
should change her. I am going with the
bundle. I just I just have them all up
here. I have the non-bundles and the
bundles, but I'm going for the bundle
for
sure. Okay.
Oh, this is so annoying to have to do in
the middle of the stream. I'm sorry, you
guys. You have to pay for it in full
when you pre-order. You don't have to,
but uh if you
It will charge a pending authorization.
So, if you don't have the full amount of
money in your account, your pre-order
will get declined.
All right, I've almost got the new links
in the description.
done. All right. So, if you refresh the
stream, you should be able to find the
new links in the description. And we're
getting super close to our like goal.
We're less than 1500 likes away from
5,000 likes, which I very much
appreciate you
guys. All right, so sorry about that.
I'm back. I am going to chug some
water. Yo, Borfest, I didn't say hi to
you yet. What's up, man?
Sam's Club. We have no Sam I have the
links in the description already for
Sam's Club, but we have no idea if
they're if they're dropping at midnight,
if they're dropping today
even, but we have them. So, if they if
they do go live, we'll let you know.
Okay. Most anticipated game. It's
Metroid for me. Oh, I forgot about
Metroid Prime 4 completely. That's so
funny. Uh, for me it's Donkey Kong. so
far, I'm just on a 3D platformer kick
and Donkey Kong 64 is such a nostalgic
game for
me. Uh, so
yeah. All right, let's see.
Uh, you don't need to use multiple
browsers. No, that part's kind of nice.
You don't have to worry about trying to
have all these different browsers.
I'm just trying to put out a tweet real
quick to just have people uh get back in
the
stream. Hold
on. Oh my god.
All
right. Who's trying to pre-order a
Switch
to That's what I'm That's what I'm
tweeting. 57.
I am so excited. This is the first I've
been in a position to be able
to.
Okay. Sorry, Jacob. It's okay, Cam.
Great to see you. Killer Cam 1020 in the
chat. Uh, Matthew Williams, so excited.
is my first console launch where I've
been in a position and able to afford
it. Dame, it is nice to be able to
afford
it. All right, guys. This is kind of
common sense stuff, but just little
reminders and
checklists. Make sure you're signed in
everywhere. Make sure you've updated
your payment method. Make sure you have
your correct shipping info on Target,
Walmart, and Best Buy.
Uh Jake, thanks for doing the Lord's
work. You've helped me into the past and
it's time to show my appreciation.
Yo, Adam Mantis
1969. Wonderful year, by the way. Thank
you so much for the 10th.
Uh super important question. What's your
favorite item of the bakery? Oh my god.
I'm a macar I'm a macaron guy. Uh we
have incredible French
macarons. That That is my favorite.
All right. Hey, thanks for everyone that
just liked my tweet. By the way, I
recognize a lot of people that are in
this chat that liked the tweet. So,
thank you for that. Separate cues for
the bundles on Best Buy, right? So, join
as many as I can, plus use the app as
well. Oh my gosh. Don't do that, Lucid
Whitney. So, big shout out to everyone
in the chat. Don't try to buy all every
single bundle on Best Buy and then just,
you know, be like, "Okay, whichever one
I get, I get." Nope. Pick one and only
go for one. You try to join multiple
cues, Best Buy's website does this weird
fraud/bot protection thing that actually
doesn't stop the bots. just kind of
stops
us and they don't tell you they're doing
this cuz obviously they don't they don't
want the bots or sculpers to know. But
if you try to go for more than one,
you're basically just shooting yourself
in the foot and you shouldn't even try
Best Buy at all. What you want to do is
pick one and only
one and have that ready. And then at
11:59 Eastern, start refreshing until
the gray button turns yellow. That's
what you want to do for Best Buy. Thank
you so much for that super chat because
I bet you just saved a lot of people
that would have made that
mistake. There can only be
one. Yeah, you shouldn't really have
multiple browsers open for Best
Buy. Trust me, less is more for Best
Buy. Uh, I have two laptops. Should I
sign Walmart, Best Buy, and Target on
both? Yeah, if you have two devices, if
you have two laptops, doesn't hurt. That
was a clutch question. Um
um Elbot, is there a link for the dock
on Walmart? It appears we don't have it
in the description.
[Music]
See, someone just thanked Lucid Whitney
for that super chat. Almost got cooked.
We're at the same Best Buy. So, I don't
actually live where where I have this
Best Buy. I'm doing this for a friend um
that has to work. So, I'm trying to get
them they they live in a different
state. I'm trying to get them one so
they can pick it up on launch day.
They've already sent me the money. And
then I'm going to try to get mine from
Walmart. And if you have to get from
multiple people, like if you have kids
or, you know, a significant other,
whatever, or you're trying to help a
friend, that's what you got to do. You
can't get more than one from the same
retailer if you're buying them
online.
Um, the Mason Twin, thank you for the
five. How come you recommended being
signed into both the browser and the app
on Best Buy in your videos? So my video
those video guides are for when only
that retailer is dropping, right? So
that video guide is for if if only if
Best Buy was the only one that was
having a restock cuz once the restocks
happen, they don't all go together. But
tonight, since they're all going
together, that's why I'm saying don't be
on the Best Buy app cuz you can only
pick one to be on on your phone, right?
So, I'm just saying if all of them are
going at the same time, I would
prioritize Target or Walmart and I over
Best Buy for sure. But some people will
use the Best Buy app and get through.
You know, it's not guaranteed anyway.
The tips I'm sharing are just what gives
you the highest probability, if that
makes sense. Uh, so if I get in line on
Walmart, am I pre-order ready? Do I go
to the app?
Um, if you get in line on Walmart, then
yes, go to the app and go to the same
thing and you'll have a different place
in line on the app as the website. So,
it just kind of gives you two chances
instead of
one. I I think it's I think Target does
both shipping and pickup, but because
it's a pre-order, they might not do
instore pickup. They haven't like made
that official announcement. Uh, which is
kind of annoying.
I don't love
it. How do I get one? The links are in
the description. I mean, there's a
ticker going across the bottom here that
has key info. And don't forget that if
you scan that QR code, you can check out
my bakery on Instagram and even follow
it. So, that's it might be the most
important tip, chat.
Yes. Yes. You guys are doing great,
chat. PHK789 says, "Refresh at 11:59
Eastern time at the 30 second mark."
Yes. So, at 11:59, you'll count to 30 in
your head. Doesn't have to be exact. And
then you'll start refreshing. The only
reason I say that is because if you
refresh too much at Walmart, it can
block your IP address. It's very
unlikely, but why not be safe? I would
hate for you to start refreshing right
at 11:59 and get blocked because of
something I said. So again, I just try
to make sure we keep it safe, you
know? Is the bakery business
lucrative? Well, I hope it will be one
day. Hydrate and rest later. Yes. Yes.
Thank you, Brit. I love you.
9,000 viewers. Welcome to the stream,
chat. Drop a like. Because we're at
9,000 viewers, I'm going to I'm going to
go over all three websites again. We're
going to kind of do it quickly. And if
you have questions, I want you to pay
attention to the blue names in the chat
because they will be answering questions
while I go through this process that
obviously I can't keep up with. if I'm
trying to explain something at the same
time. So, Dr. Claw, thank you for the
five. Does PayPal, Apple, Zip require
full payment, not just pre-auth? No,
it's all pre-authorizations for
pre-orders.
Um, so that means they will you do need
to have the full amount in your account,
but they'll put it back either the same
day or within a
week. Uh, you check out on the Best Buy
or Target, but if you pre pre-order
later on, Walmart cancel the others.
Um, yeah, if you're lucky enough to get
it in more than one
place, I would wait 3 days for any of
them to cancel. And if some of them
cancel, obviously, you'll have one
still. But if none of them cancel, I
would cancel uh from anyone that's doing
shipping and keep the one that has
instore
pickup. You're not crazy for going for
the 729 bundle on Best Buy. That's
actually really smart. Not a lot of
people are going to go for
that. Thank you, Kman. Thank you, Vinnie
30s. And thank you, uh, Borius. And oh,
I said Dr. Claw. Dr. Claw's sick name.
That goes hard, bro. All
right. One at a
time. Obviously, make sure you're signed
in everywhere. have your payment method
updated and have your shipping info
updated. One more tip before I get into
the specific websites, use PayPal or
Apple Pay or Red Card or Google Pay,
anything really besides your credit or
debit card if you
can. Um, thank you Off-Road for joining.
I'm gonna get back to the super chats
after I finish this
thought because the reason you want to
do that instead of a credit or debit
card is they will process your payment
of your credit or debit card on the same
website that's getting throttled with
too much traffic, more traffic than it
can handle, right? But if you use PayPal
or one of those other payment methods,
it processes your payment on their
server. So, it gives you a huge
advantage.
Obviously, every second matters, so that
can help a lot. Now, in terms of how you
want to do this, Best Buy and Walmart
will both put you in a queue. So, right
before midnight, you just are going to
be refreshing Best Buy and Walmart, and
they'll put you in a queue, and then
you're basically just waiting, and it
will alert you when you get through if
you're lucky enough to. So, it's kind of
like a lottery. You don't have to worry
about it. So, while those are going off,
you'll be focusing on Target, trying to
check out the oldfashioned way, just
refreshing, hoping the add to cart goes,
trying to click the add to cart doesn't
work, refresh, and you're going to have
it. So, you have Target right here, and
you have these other two where they're
just waiting. And what will happen is
when you start refreshing Walmart, you
can see right here, these PS5 pages look
very similar to the Switch 2 page. So,
this is what happens when you start
refreshing, right? Refresh, refresh,
refresh, refresh. Boom. See how that one
what that one just did. You'll be put in
line in the queue. Then you don't have
to worry about it anymore. Um the only
difference with Best Buy is that you're
going to refresh, refresh, refresh, but
it won't automatically put you in the
queue. You're going to be refresh
refresh refresh and then this little
gray button will turn yellow. You'll hit
add to cart and then it will put you in
the queue. So once you're in the queue,
which is like a waiting room for Walmart
and Best Buy where if you're lucky,
they'll let you through. You'll have
Target right here and you'll be just
actively pursuing Target.
All right, that's the Cliffnotes
version.
Um, do you know if Walmart will require
a signature? I do not know that,
unfortunately.
Um,
they haven't mentioned that. had auto
refresh on too long at Walmart and got
bot notification. Did I screw myself?
That's why I was saying don't be
refreshing. Um, just use a different
browser now for Walmart and don't be
auto refreshing. Let me let me get
blocked and tell you when to start
refreshing. That's why I said wait till
11:59 and 30 seconds start refreshing.
You're worried about not having the full
amount today or the pre-opesides from
Jake methods? can try from or affirm
through Walmart now that you're ready.
Great advice, Unaware. Thank you for the
five. Uh, Gets Outdoor, thanks for doing
the stream and being transparent about
tips and tricks for normies like me that
don't know how these online pre-order
systems work. Good luck, everyone. Mario
Kart World looks good. Thank you so
much, Gets Outdoor. And I agree, it
definitely does. Brandon Hunt, what's
the vibe on accessories like the camera
and pro controller? Should we lock in
and have those, too? I would focus on
the Switch first. just worry about
getting your console and may you lose
out on accessories because of that.
Yeah, it's possible, but wouldn't you
rather secure the system? Maybe you
wouldn't. I don't know. That's that's up
for you to decide, but that's what I'm
going to try to do. Um, how exactly does
PayPal work, though? Do I have to sign
up for it? Yeah, you would have to sign
up for it. They're the company that owns
like Venmo. So, if you have Venmo, you
probably already have PayPal. You would
just need to to get it set up and
connect it to a bank account. It's
literally the same company, so it works
in a very similar way.
Uh, Gaido Gaming, so if I start
refreshing at 1159 in 30 seconds, will I
get kicked out of Walmart with auto
refreshes? No. If you wait till then,
you should be good. And thank you for
the five. And then Primal Smashers, is
it a mistake to refresh in your saved
items list rather than a product page?
Uh, well, Walmart and Best Buy put you
in a queue. So, if you're just
refreshing your saved items page, it's
not going to do that. So, you want to be
refreshing on the product page. That's a
good
question. And Off-Road SP, thank you for
gifting the 10 memberships after you
became a member yourself. I appreciate
it. And then Stuart with with row, can
you go into multiple cues for Best Buy
on different devices on different
browsers for the same login? And no, no,
don't do it. Don't do it for Best Buy.
If you try to join the queue for
multiple
items, it can detect that and it will it
basically won't ever let you through.
So, you're going to look at all the
bundles on Best Buy. You're going to
pick one that you want to try to go for
and only focus on that one. If you try
to have multiple windows or browsers and
have a different one in each one, you're
never going to get through. You might as
well just not even try. So, Best Buy
doesn't tell you that, which is super
frustrating. I learned that the hard
way. So, I did PS5 restocks for a long
time where I told people to do that and
Best Buy changed it. So, it that hurt
your chances and I got a lot of that was
one of the times in my YouTube career
where I got a lot of push back. I had to
find that out the hard way. And so, now
that I know that, I would never, you
know, recommend doing
that. Um, good question. The Best Buy
website says shipping and pickup not
available. What does that mean? That's
just default. It's just going to say
that until it actually comes into stock.
It means nothing. And then I have
Walmart, Best Buy, Target ready to go.
My GF is ready on the apps. Let's
go. Dang, you guys are coming rapid
fire. Let me breathe. No, I'm just
kidding. 4,000 likes. Amazing. We are
1,000 likes away from our like
[Music]
goal.
H. All right. If it's past 12:00 a.m.
and it still says coming soon, do we
keep refreshing until it says add to
cart or please wait? You keep refreshing
till it the gray button.
Keep refreshing till this gray button
turns yellow and says add to cart. And
then after you click add to cart, that's
when it will say please
wait. Um, good question, Mason
Twin. And then Frostbite, you're the
reason I got a 30th anniversary PS5, so
thank you for that. And due to a f up on
UPS's and I ended up with two of them.
That's
crazy. I have one. No, I'm just kidding.
Um, Poopy Duty, what's up, dude? Uh, are
we sure the bundles on Best Buy will
also be available at midnight? Just
don't want to waste
time. Yeah, I'm Yeah, it's because it
has the coming soon on them.
What does that mean? Yep. And they have
the same high demand product. This item
is expected to sell out quickly. They
have the same verbiage on all of them.
Great question, though.
Um, I I wanted to stop and think about
it for a second. Uh, can you do two
separate bundles off different
devices? I uh I wouldn't do it for Best
Buy cuz you're going to be in the same
account unless you're doing it on
different accounts.
Yep. We're about 30 minutes away, you
guys. But keep in
mind, it's very possible that no one
actually gets a pre-order like until 10
or 15 minutes after midnight because the
sites are going to get so slammed with
traffic. The United States market is
much bigger than most other countries.
So, it's going to get slammed with so
much traffic that it doesn't even work
for like 10 to 15 minutes. That is a
possibility. And I don't want you
freaking out. you're in the stream. So,
we're going to be chill. We're going to
we're going to be
waiting. The auto refresh rate for Best
Buy and Walmart. Um, you can just start
doing it every 2 seconds once we're 30
seconds away from
midnight. Uh, and Josh Tozer, thank you.
If I'm using the Target app, is there a
best way to fresh it? You cannot refresh
on the app. I'll say it one more time
for the people in the back. the apps
don't refresh. But what you want to do
is be refreshing the websites. And then
as soon as the websites start working,
you're like, "Okay, it's live now."
That's when you go in it into it on the
app. Like you can have the app loaded up
and have the Switch to thing that you
want just sitting there, but don't
actually click on it. Wait till the
website updates via refreshing and then
click on the on the product in the app.
That's how you would do it since you
can't refresh.
Now use different devices which with
different accounts on Best Buy and
Target.
So computer uh an iPhone using Wi-Fi.
Um
you you can but there's no reason to do
that for Target. Like you're not getting
put in a queue system, so it's not going
to increase your chances. You're kind of
just wasting your time. And with Best
Buy,
um, if you're using different accounts,
then you would potentially get different
places in line using different devices.
So, Best Buy might help you a little
bit. Target, that's kind of
useless.
Um, help me get my PS5. I'm hopeful for
tonight. Thank you. You're welcome,
Miguel. Everyone hydrate. The 30 second
rule for Walmart only. Nope. 30 second
rules for
everywhere. Hey Paula, good to see you.
Oh my gosh. Shake. I almost forgot to
hit the like button. I've been in the
room for almost an hour. Hey, well,
thank you for coming. It's good to see
you. Yeah, double check and make sure.
Refresh everything once and make sure
you're not logged out of any of the
websites that you're supposed to be
logged into. Is it better to buy the
Switch 2 at Best Buy in one cart or buy
the accessories in and buy the
accessories in a different cart? Uh,
thank you for the donation, Mega
Watcher. I'm I recommend just buying the
console, not even worrying about the
accessories. And if you are lucky enough
to get the console and check out,
then go back for the accessory.
That is that is a thousand% what I would
Uh, is it Oh, I I read that one.
It's still like reading chats cuz it's
so far
behind. All right, guys. This will be
the last ad I run as long as you're okay
with it.
Um, but I'm I'm going to let you vote. I
always I always always do that. Uh, if
it's okay for me to run an ad real
quick, we're like we're we're less than
30 minutes away, so I'm not going to I'm
not going to do any more after this.
You can run 10 ads. I have premium.
What will we be rushing first? Walmart
or Best Buy? So, before I run the ad,
I'll answer that because if you have
like Google Chrome, you can just Google
easy auto refresh extension and then you
literally just click on it and it
installs. And then it's this little
puzzle piece and you click on the little
puzzle piece. Click easy auto refresh
and you can type in. So, at 11:59 I can
be like, "All right, refresh every two
seconds. Go."
And
uh it'll it'll just start. Um see it's
it's going it's doing its thing. Um 30
minutes remaining. Good luck to everyone
pre-ordering. Hey, thank you so much
outright. I appreciate that. Yo, an
off-road
SP. Oh, those are the memberships you
gifted earlier, I think. But thank you.
Thank you. I saw I saw it
again. Are we sure New Egg is dropping
at midnight tonight? No, we have no idea
when new eggs dropping. It's just
because since they have the listings, I
added them. I'm I'm I want to give you
guys all the resources possible. Should
I be on multiple devices for any of the
sites? Uh the only one where I think it
would really help is just to be uh for
Walmart because if you're on the website
and also on the app, you'll get a
different place in line on each of
those.
So the strategy
guys is
to me turn this off is to refresh
Walmart and Best Buy till it puts you in
the queue. Have auto refresh on. You
don't even have to worry about Walmart
cuz if you refresh after it puts you in
line, it doesn't do anything. So just
turn an auto refresher on. Don't worry
about it. And then for Best Buy, as soon
as it
um has a yellow add to cart, it'll be
refreshing. You actually do have to
click the yellow add to cart button,
which is where the gray button is now.
And then it will put you in the queue.
And then all you can do in those is wait
and do nothing else. So while those are
waiting, you'll just spend all your time
refreshing and trying to add to cart the
oldfashioned way on target. That is the
strategy.
Um, thank you guys for saying that I can
run an ad. I will run that real quick.
Okay, ad is going
premium gang. Let's go.
So, the website is better for all of
them just because you can refresh the
website. And I would use either if
you're using your phone, if you're going
to use an app, it would be Walmart or
Target. Best Buy is so trash that I I
just it's not worth it if you have the
option of using Target or Walmart
instead for apps.
If I use the will of the app works the
same as the website. You're just going
to click the product once it's live and
it'll put you in a queue.
Um, switch to Mario Kart bundle or buy
physical later. So, there's pretty much
twice as many Mario Kart bundles as
there is just
Switches. Um, so literally double the
amount. So, you technically have better
odds to get the Mario Kart bundle. But
what it comes down to is do we think
more people are going to try to get the
Mario Kart bundle? Like if we think 90%
of people are going to try to get the
Mario Kart bundle, well then even if
there's twice as many, it would still
gives you a better chance to get the
standalone, right? So we don't really
know that. But just going if we think
it's going to be around 50/50, then
going for the bundle would be better.
I'm going to be going for the bundle.
Um, so I should or shouldn't be on
multiple devices for Best Buy for one
bundle.
I don't I don't think you need to. I
think it's
overkill for Best
Buy. So, I want to talk about Best Buy
for a second
because it's going to really
uh hard I have no other way to say this.
It's going to piss some people off. What
happens? What'll be happening at Best
Buy is you'll be refreshing, refreshing,
starting at 11:59 Eastern, right before
midnight. It'll have a yellow button
that says add to cart eventually. One of
the times you refresh, click
that. Um, the auto refreshes tool is
called easy auto refresh. Just Google
it. And thank you so much, Tech is
amazing. But once you click the add to
cart, it'll say, "Please wait. This is a
high demand item. You are in a line.
We'll let you know when it's your turn."
And it can sit like that for 10 or 15
minutes. What people do is they get
frustrated and they try refreshing and
they try exiting out of the listing and
coming back in when really the best
thing you can do is let it wait. Even if
it's taking 15 minutes, which will feel
like forever, you have to just let it
sit there. And if it never lets you
through, it's not your fault. You know,
it was just it just never let you
through. You didn't do anything wrong.
But that's what you need to do for Best
Buy. You have to just let it sit there.
So, I can't stress that enough. For Best
Buy, people try to do too
much. Just refresh till you get the ad
to cart and then wait. Now, if you get
through, if the please wait goes away,
I'll be coaching you on stream from what
to do to there. It's it's pretty
straightforward, but if you get stuck at
different points, I'll help you, but
until you get through that, just don't
touch it. Don't touch it. Um, Matthew
Williams, thank you for the 20, man.
Hey, chat. Can we get him to 5k likes
right now? Dude, thank you, dude. Been
donating all night just to hype up the
stream and I really appreciate it. Uh,
can you do a full rundown of the target
strategies for those coming in late?
Thank you for the five home slice. Uh,
for sure. So, I I just went over Best
Buy. So, rewind the stream like five
minutes or so if you need to get the
Best Buy rundown. Um, for Target.
Target's the only one that doesn't use a
Q system. So once you're in the queue
for Best Buy and Walmart, you're going
to be just be refreshing Target, waiting
for the and it's the website's already
kind of chugging, but you're going to be
waiting for the add to cart to come in.
And then you're basically going to check
out the oldfashioned way where add to
cart, it might kick it out of your cart.
Um, and you have to go back. You're
basically just going to be trying over
and over for Best Buy. It's it's like
common sense. I mean, for Target, it's
like common sense basically like what
you would do if I wasn't helping you.
just trying it over and over. But one
thing that can help if it keeps kicking
it out of your cart if the website's
chugging
um super super helpful is use
specifically for Target, use PayPal or
Apple Pay because when it gets to the
step of processing your payment, it'll
process your payment on PayPal server or
Apple server instead of the Target
server that's not working. Right? So,
that is the best advice I can give you
there. But if there's other things that
are happening at the time of the drop,
I'll keep you
posted.
Um, let's
let's and then how is the app/computer
dynamic? Will it screw my order if add
to cart on both app and chrome from the
same account, same skew, not different
bundles? Uh, that's that should not
screw you over. No, it's a limit of one.
So, if you try to add more than one to
cart, if like let's say you add it to
cart on the website and then you
accidentally add it to cart at the app
at the same time, whichever one was
second just won't add is pretty
much All right, the last one that I'm
going to go over real quick, obviously
Walmart. Walmart's the easiest. You just
start refreshing at 11:59 and 30
seconds. And then All right. So, this is
for PS5, but it's going to work the same
way. So, I'm going to show you this. So,
see these PS5 pages? This is before it
went into stock and it had the blue
message. So, right here, the Switch 2,
it's the same thing, right? Before it
went to stock, it has that blue message.
Um, GameStop is pre-orders will be
tomorrow. And auto refresh, just Google
easy auto refreshes. If you want an auto
refresher to use at
1159, that is what it's called. Easy
auto refresh. I I can't explain it any
more than that. You Google it and you
click it and it automatically adds it to
your browser. Click the little puzzle
piece and click easy auto refresh after
you've done that. You can type in every
two seconds you want it to refresh.
Um, but with Walmart, this is what it
looks like right now.
Limit of one applies to all stores.
Yeah. So, when you start refreshing for
Walmart, this is what it's going to look
like once you're in line. Once you're in
the
queue, it's refreshing. Boom. Says
you're in line. Then you don't touch it.
You can just focus on target at that
point.
20
minutes. Let's go. So, I just talked
about
everything 10 minutes ago. So, if you
need help on either Best Buy, Target, or
Walmart, rewind the stream 10 minutes
because I walked in the last 10 minutes,
I walked everyone through all
three. What store is best for Switch to
delivery?
Walmart.
Easy. So, this poll is going to help and
hurt you, but it's going to show pe show
everyone what is going to be the most
popular option. I'm I'm assuming it's
going to be Best Buy. So, if the
majority of people are going for Best
Buy, that kind of shows you that Best
Buy will be the hardest. So, where are
you trying to pre-order from? You can
vote on this poll in the
chat,
Walmart, Best
Buy. I'll throw GameStop on here even
though they're not going live tonight.
Um,
target. All right, 13,000 viewers. We're
about to hit 5,000 likes. You
guys, if you if you're going to get a
pre-order today, hit that like button.
That's what that
means. Any tips for Walgreens? Uh,
Bloomkit, I love you. I'm already losing
my voice, you guys.
sound like a
preubescent middle school
boy. That's That's pretty cool, you
know. Pretty all
right. We hit 5K likes. Thank you
guys. All
right. Uh 5K likes. Let's go. Thank you,
battle mage. Appreciate you, man. Battle
mage
15. Because we hit 5,000 likes, we're
going to do one more hype session
between the stream. If you guys are just
joining, this is going to be very
different than everything else that has
happened. It's going to be very weird.
John Morant, I know you're in the chat
and I know this is
uh your favorite thing that I that I
do. Love you, Jaw.
This one's for you,
buddy. Yeah, I'll do a poll for that.
Slammy, by the way, thank you for the
five. All right, everybody.
We are about 15 minutes
away from pure chaos. Except it's not
going to
be. Have
hope. Believe in yourself. Believe in
the
stream. You're going to do this. Your
anxiety is lying to
[Applause]
you. You are going to be okay.
So, let's secure the bag. Let's have
fun. Look at the party we have going in
here. Look at the
entertainment. This is exciting. It
makes you feel like a kid again. And
that's what this is all
about. Let's head get some finger guns.
Let's get them right
[Music]
now. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[Music]
In case you don't
know, the finger guns
which do shoot
bullets, but they shoot love
bullets. They're love bullets from my
heart to
yours of
positivity and happiness and
energy. And that's what this
is. The less secure the bad.
[Music]
Heat.
[Music]
Heat. Heat. Heat. N.
[Music]
All right, that one was for you, Jaw.
Seriously, John Morant likes that so
much he started doing it at his
games. Got in trouble for it.
Who's Yeah, it gets you gets you
hyped. Oh my gosh, guys. I'm so far
behind in the super chat.
Invite squad. What is
up? All right, let me put on some
background music.
All right, guys.
Told you not to refresh till 11:59.
That's why it does
block. Hey, refreshing too much blocks
you. Yes, I did.
I don't care if I get
blocked. Uh, this is this is for
science.
I'm not trying to pre-order on on these.
Uh I'm not going to show you like my
credit card info, you know, all my stuff
on this.
This is just
guys. I'm going to attempt to read some
of the super
chats. Senpai, thank you for the sesh.
Fire cow tipping the stream. I
appreciate
you. Double checking is it okay to have
Best
Buy website on PC open at the same
time. That's
fine. Uh you have one one on the PC and
one on your phone. That's probably fine.
But I would I would recommend doing that
for one
um 712. Good to see you. I
appreciate Michael Campa. Thank you so
much. 20 Crusher Bat 6. Uh, good thing I
use a full when I have both. I'm still
out of breath. Both Walmart and Best Buy
apps ready. Have them on
my Let's go, dude. Ready to go. Gristle.
Should I avoid the Best Buy bundle with
Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong? I
don't There's no reason to. It's not
like you have to wait for Donkey
Kong. Pick up your Switch 2 uh when that
comes out. Pick up Donkey Kong. That
comes
out. Mike is cutting
out. All right. How are we doing? How
are we doing now, chat? Are we
goated better? Okay. Sorry about that
you guys.
Yikes. Yikes.
just talk for a bit and we'll see. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay. Might be the gain setting sounds
better
now. Yeah. We We've had a lot of issues
with the chat's going
in. Mike is cutting at the end of
sentence.
Not better.
Okay. Did I bump it? Maybe
check one, two, check. Check. One, two,
check.
Okay. Absolute worst time for the mic to
be doing
this. Good luck everyone.
Better. Better.
Sounds clear right now. Your mic is
fine.
Yikes. Okay.
All right, guys. Thank you so much for
helping
me. Target link is dead.
Yeah. So, I So, I would
expect that
No one's going to be able to get one for
a few minutes when they come into stock
at midnight. I I would expect the
traffic just to be too
much. Uh good luck in the chat. Yankee
has a hookup for the Epic Switch 2
accessories. Thank you for the 20 human
things. I appreciate
that. Uh 10 minutes left. Get hyped
everyone. It's almost time. Thank you
outright and Luke the master. Just want
to double check. You can refresh every 2
to3 seconds on Best Buy and Walmart
starting at 11:59 and 30
seconds.
Yes. Uh, and I would wait uh 30 seconds
for Target as well. And thank you for
the for the super
chat. There's only one song that we can
play right now.
Chat, tell me if you know it. What song
am I about to play?
And it's not the hype session.
So this is a Walmart website even on my
phone. On your phone you can use the
Walmart
app. The only thing about the apps is
you cannot refresh the apps. That's why
it's better to have the websites up on
your computer. Be refreshing those and
as soon as they start working then go
into the app.
Chat,
we're going chat. You you know exactly
what I was going to do. Switch to
accessories.
Let's go. Is that a dog or a cat behind
you? Good
question. That is my dog. That is
Phillip. You can only see a little teeny
bit of his head.
[Music]
[Music]
Don't have a mental breakdown.
So, we're seven minutes away.
[Music]
We must make a
How should we handle getting accessories
with the free? Should we place a new
order once we confirmed that we have the
console using Walmart?
[Music]
My body is ready. Let's go.
So, yeah. So, I get pretty quiet right
when the the drop starts so I can
monitor everything that's going on and
then communicate it to you.
So, if I'm if I'm being quiet,
that just means I'm I'm assessing the
situation. I don't want to distract you.
Do what we've done, which I I'll go over
the strategy one more time. Do what
we've done. Do what we've gone over.
Someone asked me to confirm human. Does
this mean I won't be able to pre-order
it? Congratulations. You have refreshed
too much, which I've said not to do. Uh,
but what you can do is whatever browser
you're in on Walmart, use a different
one. So, if you were refreshing too much
and you were on Chrome, open up Edge.
And please, please do not refresh till
11:59 and 30 seconds. I promise I'm
saying that to try to help you.
Um, I'm ready uh to go crazy for a snag.
So, again, the strat, here's the strat.
the strategy. You want to be refreshing
only at 11:59 Eastern and you want to
wait about 30 seconds and then you want
to start refreshing Walmart and Best
Buy. Walmart will automatically put you
in a queue one of the times you refresh.
Then you don't have to worry about it.
So this is what it looks like.
So this is refresh refresh refresh
and then boom, it changed to you're in
line. So that's what it'll look like for
the Switch as
well. Best Buy, it's the same thing.
Refresh, refresh, refresh. But the
coming soon will turn to a yellow add to
cart. So there's one more step. You need
to click the yellow add to cart.
Thank you, Crunky. I appreciate that.
Um, so those two, it just puts you in a
queue and you just have to sit there and
wait. So, while those two you're sitting
there and waiting, you're going to just
refresh Target and try to add to cart
the oldfashioned way. Now, for Best Buy,
do not absolutely do not have different
bundles open in multiple tabs and be
trying to get, you know, just seeing
whichever one you can get. Like, you're
trying to get this bundle and this tab,
you're trying to get this bundle and
this tab. That will screw you over. Best
Buy's website detects picks up on that
the same activity and will just let you
not get anything. You have to look at
these, pick one. Pick one you're going
to try to go
for, have that ready, and then at 11:59
and 30 seconds, start refreshing until
the the coming soon turns to add to
cart. Now, if we're in a situation where
maybe this
bundle is in stock yet, but for whatever
reason, this bundle
isn't, I will tell you on the stream.
I'll be like, "Guys, this bundle's
working. This one isn't. Go to this one.
Go to this one." I will share the
specific link in the chat. I'll spam it.
So, I'm about to be hyperfocused, really
quiet, monitoring that kind of
stuff. Why 30 seconds and not 11:59?
Because, as you've seen in the chat,
people are getting blocked from
refreshing too much. If you start
non-stop refreshing at
11:59, they will block your IP address
and you'll have no chance potentially,
right? So, be
safe. Okay.
Okay, guys. So, here we go. Here we
go. Like the stream for good luck. This
is your last chance. I mean, you could
technically do it after, but it's your
last chance to have good luck to do it,
right?
Metal Jesus rocks. What's up, dude? Good
luck, everybody. Here we go. We're We're
in this
together. At this point, there's only so
much I can do. You have to be focused.
All right? Don't be typing in the chat.
All right? Be just trying. Don't worry
about the stream. Like, listen to me,
but don't be worrying about asking
questions or typing in the chat. Just
focus on trying to get it right
now. And keep in
mind, okay, do we have it? All right. Do
we have it? Anything at
Walmart? Let's go. Walmart's gone.
Walmart's gone. I mean, Walmart's not
gone.
It's Walmart's in
line. Let's
go. Just once you're in line, you don't
have to do anything. Just make it so it
looks like this. You'll get a random
spot. So, even if you didn't join right
away, you could still be the first one
to get through. It's going to hold that
spot in
line. Walmart does have the queue. We'll
join the queue on two just so you can
see what
happens. Don't say hold my spot and keep
shopping. Just leave it up. It doesn't
have to refresh anymore.
Now, one thing that could happen is that
the queue resets where it's like it
can't handle the traffic, so it boots us
back to the regular screen and we have
to start refreshing again. So, just stay
posted. Let me help you with that. At
this point, you can probably start
refreshing
um for Best Buy.
Best Buy slow on the
refresh. I'm going to start doing every
5second refresh on Best Buy just because
uh it is slow to refresh. It is It is
lagging. Target's gone already. Okay.
All right, guys. I told you I was going
to get
quiet. Yep. Target crashed for me,
too. That This is what I said could
happen, right? where like we don't even
get our pre-orders till 15 minutes after
midnight. You clicked on hold my spot in
line accidentally. Just go back to the
console. Just go back to
it. All right.
Target. If it says sold out, that's not
accurate. Just wait. I'm telling you,
wait like 10 5 to 10 minutes for Target.
Don't Don't give up on it
yet. Okay, people are saying Best Buy.
Do we see Best Buy?
My Best Buy won't even
load once you get in the queue. You
don't have to
refresh. Targets back up.
It is a blood
bath. That's why still saying coming
soon. One thing I'm going to do is share
different
links and see if that if that helps.
Some people are getting through on
Target. If you can get Target to go
through, guys, if the link direct link
isn't working to Target, one thing you
can do is if you had it saved to your
favorites, try to add from your
favorites or just go to the regular
Target website
um or the app. try the app as well
and just search for switch two and like
the oldfashioned way and try to get it
to add that
way. Yeah, all my target links aren't
working. But if you're if you get
through on
target, you got the bundle at
Target. 90% of people 95% of people are
not getting on target. But if you're
having trouble with the website, switch
to the app. So now is the time where if
you weren't on the stream, you would
have no idea to do this, but try
switching to the app.
Target is by far and away the best one.
Keep obviously you're staying in line at
Walmart. This is exactly what we talked
about. Um if you can get in the queue at
Best Buy, I haven't seen anyone do that
yet. So, the app is working way better,
guys. The app is working absolutely
better. So, I'm going to try and
pre-order.
If you were on the website in the app,
it should on target, it should have your
uh recently viewed.
And remember, Apple Pay is clutch for
Target.
Apple Pay or PayPal or Google
Pay. It's showing for me that it will
arrive June 11th from
Target. So far, guys, I'm monitoring
everything. So far, Target's the only
one that's really having the success. I
haven't seen anyone get through the line
at Walmart. Uh I've seen some people say
that it was live at Best Buy, and I I
haven't seen that happen
yet. So, I tried Apple Pay and got
declined from from Target, just FYI.
payment. Yeah. Keeps failing.
So now I might try I might try to switch
to a different payment method for
Target. How are people doing on the
Walmart app?
Everyone's just in line at Walmart.
Okay,
someone says they got Mario Kart on uh
on Walmart.
All right, I'm going to switch to trying
to use my my debit card on Target
instead of uh
I'm also getting a can't verify address
on Target when I I've never had that
issue before. So, I'm just trying to to
to process it. Anyways,
I timed out trying to use a debit
card. Oh,
no. Uh, okay.
Uh, got the bundle on Walmart. For those
waiting, that was the easiest for me.
Target second for me. PayPal is the best
option for both. Thank you for that
super chat.
Target was seamless and hasslefree.
Check that at Walmart and Target. So
Walmart's just random. So if you're in
line at Walmart, don't worry about it.
Uh but yeah, so Best Buy and Walmart put
you in cues, but Target's the only one
you really have control.
Target still hasn't worked for me. So,
I'm just going to try I'm just going to
try PayPal.
Yeah, Target app is in the goat for
today. Got it from Target using Apple
Pay. I' I've seen all three payment
methods people get W's with. I've seen
people saying that they use PayPal, that
they use Apple Pay, and that they use
their debit card. But either way, just
trying to go through Target is it looks
like the way the Target app
specifically. And again, being in the
stream, you would have no way of knowing
unless you were here. So, it's it's good
that we can adjust on the fly. That's
kind of what I was talking about. I'm
going to keep you updated on Walmart and
Best Buy.
Um, I haven't even seen the add to cart
come up on Best
Buy. I've seen some people get through
with Walmart.
Okay. Someone someone else got it
through Walmart.
Target app works.
Yo, everyone that's sending in super
chats right now. Obviously, I'm a little
distracted, but I appreciate you so so
so much.
Target bundle order confirmed. Let's go.
I'm happy you guys are getting it. I
don't really care if I get it on this or
not. I'll find a way.
Okay, people are getting
through on
uh on Walmart. So, if it if it looks
like this, if it says you're in line,
just keep
chilling. Yeah, Walmart checkouts are
actually starting to happen.
Target app non-bundle. It seems like
there's more successes with the
non-bundle on target than with the
bundle. So, if you've been trying for
the bundle on target, perhaps try for
the um
for just for just the console. So,
someone got their got it from Target
using their bag. Thank you for that
super chat. Um and what five dev
outright still in line at Walmart? Yeah,
you just chill and wait. Target website
worked for someone. How's the Target
website looking?
Yeah, that's that's cooked for me on my
end. Yeah, it's not sold out on Walmart.
I can confirm that.
Target. Thank you so much.
Yo, congrats to the people that are
getting it. I know a lot of
us. I got mine from KB Toys. Wait, what?
Love it.
John secured at Target 121. Apple Pay
shipped after launch is fine. I can rest
easy.
Jake, absolute goat. Let's
go, guys. We're still at the beginning
of this. There's still a lot to come.
Strap in. Best Buy hasn't gone live, I
think, for
anyone. Best Buy is just
cooked right now. The move is just wait
in line at
Walmart. And if you're lucky, you get
through. And while you're waiting, try
to go for Target.
GameStop's not live. You shouldn't be
trying for GameStop. GameStop's
tomorrow. I'll be live again for
GameStop.
It's always possible you could get
cancelled, but if it says
confirmed, that's
great. That's what you want.
All right, more and more people are
getting it through Walmart. Let's go.
[Music]
Let's go. This is crazy. 23,000 people
on the stream.
If you if you were able to secure or if
being on the stream has been helpful at
all, make sure you hit the like for me.
I keep having the address problem with
Target as well. You are not alone there.
So, one thing I'm going to try to do,
uh, which I should have done this and I
didn't realize, is turning the Wi-Fi off
on my phone and just using data to try
to check out through Target.
Yep. If you're not have if you're not
getting lucky on Target, people are
getting through on Walmart. Just make
sure you're checking your Walmart tabs
as well. And then Best Buy hasn't gone
at all. And that's where most people are
trying to
go. The Best Buy guy fell asleep.
Why does it say June 11th? Cuz that's
when that you'll get it.
Target was never guaranteed to arrive on
launch. Okay,
Walmart bag secured. Target app worked.
See, look it. This is 15 minutes after
midnight and people are still getting it
through these ways. I'll keep you
posted. I'll keep like narrating right
here. Okay, if they sell out, whatever,
if you should give up, I'll tell you.
Until then, let me be your guide of
like, yes, yes, it is worth it to keep
going.
[Music]
Amazon does is not going to sell any
ever.
Thank you guys so much for the super
chats. I'm sorry I can't shout out
everyone right now,
but I I am reading them. I just I I
can't like say them fast enough, but
they're going through my head mentally,
and I really do appreciate
it. Okay, it looks like the regular
Switch 2 nonbundle is now sold out via
Target. I would keep trying, but
obviously maybe focus on the Mario Kart
bundle now.
after many failed
attempts. Target dub Mario Kart
bundle. My Target Mario Kart bundle
still says pre-order.
Um, remind people to like check their I
got my target confirmation despite it
saying it failed in the
app. Interesting.
[Music]
That'd be crazy if I just bought like
five of them. All right, I don't have
anything in my email, thank
goodness. Well, it's limit one, so they
would get cancelled, but still.
[Music]
They just my card. Does that mean I got
it?
All right, people are still just getting
it now.
Target is working now. We're still
waiting for anything from Best
Buy.
Another person got it with their credit
card on target.
I got mine on the Target app. had to
enter my address and then my card info a
hundred
times. That is common like people that's
how many So for people that are watching
that h don't have it yet the people that
have success you're seeing oh I got it I
got it I got it. What you're not seeing
is that yeah it can take like over a
hundred times.
[Music]
[Music]
I'm seeing all three payment methods.
I'm seeing Apple Pay, I'm seeing PayPal,
and I'm seeing um debit credit
card. Yes. Persistence is everything.
[Music]
Exactly. Should I refresh on?
The website looks like it's a little
more functional for Target now, but I
don't see an add to cart. I The app is
absolutely the way to go.
Oh, mine is like going crazy right now.
All right, let's go, chat.
You know, Target was always my go-to
um for the PS5, and it looks like
they're coming in really clutch right
now with Switch pre-orders.
Okay. So, I tried to add to
cart in uh the app and then going on the
website since the website's working now
to try to place my
order because I'm not getting the
address error on the website.
Target. Okay.
Your girlfriend got it for you.
That's That is
clutch. Yeah, Best Buy. I agree. I mean,
the fact that Best Buy isn't dropping
yet is giving us hope at
least. Yeah. Don't give up on Target.
This is the struggle. I like people are
DMing me the receipts and like what time
they're coming
through and people are still getting
them. Like I can see the time stamps. I
can see it on their screenshots on their
phone. They're still getting it even
now. So this is exactly the game plan is
just keep keep persisting in Target
while you're waiting at um Walmart. As
soon as something happens with Best Buy,
I'm going to start screaming about it.
the It looks like the the website is now
working better than the app. I think
it's cuz we all jumped over to the app.
So, if you've got it if you got it in
your cart um on the app, this is the
other tip that I was telling you about.
Jump over the website now and try to
check out on there
um while you're
still also attempting on the app.
Yeah, I'm getting that same PayPal error
when I try to do it on the website.
Um, yeah, don't worry if you didn't get
a confirmation email. It might take some
time.
Basically, we're all in that same place
where right when you go to place order,
the website can't handle it. So, it's
just putting you in a loop and the
people that are getting it were lucky
enough that they slip through. So, how
do you get your order to get to slip
through on target? You just keep trying
over and over.
target web just worked for you. Yeah,
exactly. So, you would just keep
pressing place order. There's not like
anything else extra you can do at that
point.
[Music]
Best Buy has not gone live yet.
[Music]
[Music]
Finally got it on target. New Egg hasn't
I mean New Egg was never confirmed to
go.
Walmart confirmation email should mean
you're good.
[Music]
Got a Target web pre-order bundle with
debit. If you're trying to use the
website,
I would say go with your debit card. If
you're trying on the app, I would I
would say Apple Pay or Google Pay.
I didn't get it yet. It's crazy. Oh,
wait.
My Walmart's starting to uh freak out.
I don't know what's going on with my
Walmart.
See, the Walmart's not on auto refresh.
It's just going
crazy. Yeah, if you if you place a
second order, it'll let you and then
you'll get cancelled later.
Fam placed order. Yeah, that's that's
the way. I know it seems pointless
because you're you're pushing place
order like hundreds of times and it's
not working, but that is literally the
way to do it.
[Music]
Took me 20 minutes on Target's website
with credit
card. I got mine from the Target app.
Let's go. Keep trying.
I know it's stupid for me to just keep
saying the same thing, but I I just want
to provide encouragement for the people
that are in the same position as me
where it's still not
working. Cancellation is a like a
possibility right when pre-order
um
right when pre-orders go on, no matter
where you get it from.
How long?
At this point, I'm I have my debit card
selected on both
uh the Target app and the website. And
I'm just trying to get it to work. I'm
just hitting place order basically on
both.
That spy still not live is crazy. I
agree.
All right, here is
All right, here is my
uh last ditch effort that I'm going to
try right now is I'm going to try
switching from Chrome
uh to Microsoft Edge. Just seeing what
[Music]
happens. Listen to this man. No matter
how annoying it is, he's
right. I I wish I could make it easier,
but I I promise it's the persistence
that's going to be
key. Okay.
Okay, guys. I switched from Chrome to
Edge and it worked immediately. My order
is placed at Target. All I did was
switch my
browser. So, if you do that and it works
for you, please like the stream. That
That is the point is I'm in the
background trying all this crazy stuff
and then when I get something to work, I
tell you guys.
So people are saying Best Buy might be
live now.
Yep. Best Buy is live.
So click that yellow button.
[Music]
Okay, Best Buy is getting errors. It's
not putting you right in the queue. It's
like saying sold out and stuff like
that.
Thank you so much. So, so Best Buy is
working, you guys. Best Buy is now
working. Go for Best
Buy. Best Buy did not sell out in two
seconds. This is what I warned you
about. When they first launch, it
[Music]
appears. So, you're still waiting in you
should still be waiting in line for
Walmart and uh you should be trying to
navigate the Best Buy website now as
well. All
right. This is kind of This is kind of
killing me.
Target. Use the
app. All right. Best See, I told you
Best Buy. It's working for people now.
You're in line. Boom.
So, this is what it should look like
right now
uh for Best
Buy. Let's go.
My
target app worked for people. Love
that. The way I got target to work was
using my Edge browser.
Yep. I Yep. I know. I I know Target's
cancelling orders. Sorry. Apparently, I
can't
talk. The adrenaline is crazy, isn't it?
Like, you get like pretty hyped up.
That's my order placed. Love to see it.
I got the the bot thing on on Walmart
without even refreshing.
Pre-order now.
What the heck?
You'll know if Target canceled your
order because
uh because you'll get an
email.
Crazy night. Yeah, I I we're in line at
Best Buy here as well. Best Buy is now
live.
Walmart's been just like awful for me,
but I'm I'm still like giving it the old
try.
Your mom got it on Best Buy. That's
awesome.
Target and
Walmart. All right.
Granny, you're the goat. I switched to a
different browser and it worked. Let's
go. Yeah. If if you're not if your
browser is not working for Target, um
switch to a different
one. All right. People are getting it on
Best Buy. If Best Buy still says coming
soon, definitely switch your browser cuz
Best Buy is 100%
live and the pre-order button is uh lit
up. Once you're in line on Best Buy,
don't refresh. Don't mess
around. Just uh just chill.
Target website.
Best Buy just went through for you.
Let's go. Got it on Best Buy. All right,
we're starting to see some some W's of
Best Buy. Love to see it.
I'm closely watching Best Buy as well.
Nothing on my end.
[Music]
Oh, I got I got the cancellation from
Target.
I I actually did get the
cancel. So there you
go. I'm back. I'm back to square
one. Hopefully hopefully Best Buy comes
through. Although I'm not trying to get
one for me from Best Buy.
[Music]
Yeah, classic target.
Congrats to people that are getting it
for sure.
[Music]
Yep. Just stay in line for Best Buy. So,
I'm just waiting for Walmart and Best
Buy. And uh I'm just playing around with
Target while those are while those are
happening.
Confirm
[Music]
email for 15%
Yeah, if you've got it in your cart at
Target, just the website lets you just
click the place order over and over and
over again as opposed to the app where
you have to like kind of like reselect
stuff
again. So, just spam that place order
button on Target.
My theory is that they're they pause
orders on Target, they wait for certain
ones to get cancelled and then they do a
wave of stock again. So, if you're
lucky, if you're if you're non-stop
clicking the place order button, you
will when they put in their next wave,
whoever is non-stop clicking it gets
through. That's my theory.
Yo, congratulations to everyone that's
that's pulling through.
[Music]
I'm I'm just trying to get one for
myself and then I'm trying to uh
pre-order for my friend to have that
lives across the country to his Best Buy
so he can pick it up. So if my Best Buy
goes through, it's set to his
store. Yeah. Do not refresh Best Buy or
Walmart. Just let it chill.
[Music]
to add a new item to cart. Will I be
paying double or
no? This is a long
journey. Yeah, I'm in the target
cancellation boat. So, I I I feel your
pain.
It took me 20 minutes.
All right, let's see.
Wait,
I
I have an order from Target, but it
never went through on my
end from just now. I wonder if it's
going to cancel
again. Let me go check my orders.
That's crazy.
got through on Best Buy with the bundle
Chrome PayPal bank account. Thanks,
Jake. Yo, of course. Of course. All
right, let me go look at my orders on
Target and see if I I have one who knows
purchase history.
Oh, I just see the canceled one. That's
so weird.
The email saying I got it just came
through. Was that for the canceled one?
But the
confirmation. That's super confusing if
it is.
Yeah, it's the confirmation. It's the
same order number. So, the confirmation.
Oh, Walmart. What?
Hello. All right. Hold on. We're You're
coming over here for a second, buddy.
And that that goes to show you that
literally just waiting is what you need
to do for Walmart.
Even though it gave me all those errors,
all that weird stuff.
Says confirmed from Walmart.
Launch day delivery confirmed.
Oh, it's so funny. It's getting
delivered to my girlfriend's house. I
didn't even check my address. I didn't
follow my own tips. That's okay. That's
actually where I live. I'm never here
except for when I make YouTube comment
content. This is literally just my
office now.
Yo, did chat are we are we goated?
Are we goated?
Chat,
what? No way.
So, yeah, even though Target sent me a
confirmation email after the
cancellation, if you if I check my
orders, it's canled.
got Walmart. Wow, finally
42 minutes into the
restock. All
right, I'm still trying from Honestly, I
wanted to get it for my friend more than
I wanted to get it to
myself. Uh, so I'm I'm still in the same
boat as you guys.
Let's go. Okay, I'm I'm watching Best
Buy like a hawk.
Thank you guys for 9,000 likes on the
stream. Uh the the the like goal was
5,000 and I we might hit 10,000.
People are getting through. So, remember
when I said there was waves? It looks
like uh Walmart just released another
wave, and that's why I wasn't the only
one.
People are saying Target's out of stock.
I haven't seen that
confirmed. Target sold said sold out.
Okay. People are saying Target did say
sold
out. Yeah. Okay. I'm seeing out of stock
on the Mario Kart World bundle and I
think we already saw it.
Yep.
Okay. Targets looking dead 44 minutes
into this
restock. The good news is it's hands-off
approach now, right? You're just waiting
in line at Best Buy or you're waiting in
line at Target.
Just got your Walmart order. Let's go.
I'm starting to get exhausted.
Okay. All right. I'm going to do a poll
in the chat.
I want to I want to see how we're
looking overall. Have you
gotten a
pre-order
yet? So, this poll is about to get
posted
up. from people. And this is this is
also what I was saying that like it
literally gets easier the further after
the restock cuz the website starts being
able to handle the traffic better and
more and more people give up. So your
odds weirdly increase the longer the
time goes by obviously until it sells
out then your odds are are
[Music]
done. My Walmart literally pops at the
same time as
yours. Oh wow, a lot of
people over 3,000 people have gotten
their pre-order from the stream.
That's just who are actually voting. It
could it could be more. It's literally
50/50 with 7,000 votes. So 30 3,500
people have gotten it from the
stream. Guys, I'm gonna put out a tweet
tomorrow that just
says if if my YouTube videos or my live
stream helped you get a Switch tube
pre-order, like this tweet. If you see
that tweet pop
up, I would love for you to uh to to
like that tweet.
Wow. 5,000
people from this
stream. That's crazy.
Thank you guys. Everyone that voted in
the poll. It's It's so awesome to see
that.
Thank you guys.
I'm still seeing these super chats come
in and I'm I'm seeing the wins and I
appreciate you guys so so much.
I I know I've been a lot quieter since
the drop happened, but it's cuz I I
really went all out to answer every
single question I I could and I repeated
myself for the process so many times.
So, I'm getting a little tired. I am
going to be live again in the morning to
help you guys for
GameStop. So, confirmed over 6,000
people have gotten it from this live
stream so far.
I'm going to leave that poll up for a
while, I think. Yo, Off-Road SP, you've
been Someone put this dude on the cover
of Time magazine. I was on the front
page of the New York Times when I did
this for the PS5. I was on the Today's
Show. Time magazine, are you next? You
want You want some Jake
Randall? Sorry if that comes off as like
crude or cringey to to hype myself up,
but I'm I'm just a little excited that I
that I helped a lot of people, but I'm
also really motivated to help the people
that are still
struggling. Keep going, guys. I let you
know when Target was was done. I'm going
to do the same for Walmart and Best Buy.
I I am in the same boat as you guys
where I'm just like, please Best Buy at
this point. Like, yeah, Walmart would be
great, too, if you're waiting on
Walmart, but like I feel like it's going
to go through somewhere. We want that
midnight launch pickup. Might as
well. Let's go. Thank you. Thank you
guys so much.
You know what? I'm just going to do the
tweet right now.
[Music]
My YouTube videos
[Music]
or live
stream helped
you
pre-order a Switch, too.
Like like this tweet
that tweet is sent.
more a lot more Best Buys coming
through. I like that. I like that.
None for me, but I'm glad for you since
I haven't been going on the app at all.
Um, might as well just slap my Best Buy
app up and see what happens so I can let
you guys know how that's going.
It really shouldn't make any
difference. Oh, another wave of
Walmart. Everyone's coming through on
Walmart right now. Let's
go. It's almost like I should redo the
polls. I feel like a lot of the nos have
switched to yeses.
Target.
Let's go, you guys.
Wow, we've already got like 700 likes on
that tweet.
[Music]
I'm going to uh I'm pinning that tweet.
So, if you want to if you want to like
that tweet, if I helped you secure, you
can go ahead and do that. If I helped
you secure, you you actually you don't
have to like the tweet even, but if you
want to, you can. Obviously, I'd
appreciate
it. Still stuck in line at Best Buy and
Walmart. I'm right there with you,
brother.
Got yours on the first try using the
target app. That's fire.
I'm so
sweaty. And I mean that in multiple
ways. I think Jake made his goal. I I
think I did.
Just got a regular Switch to at Walmart
without a queue. Oh, let's go.
Thank you so much.
Oh, my chat stopped working for a
second. Oh, Walmart. Let's go. Walmart's
still coming through for people.
I really wouldn't give up yet, guys.
Like if Walmart's come through this many
times and it hasn't Target did a lot,
but if Best Buy hasn't gotten this as
many wins as Walmart or Target did, that
just tells me that there's still a lot
of stock left at Best Buy.
Let's go.
Oh, I got a fraud alert.
Of course, cuz Well, cuz I wasn't going
to use my card.
I got
Wow. I got like three fraud alerts on my
card. That's why PayPal's clutch. You
use PayPal, you never have to worry
about that.
Okay. Looks like there's no more queue
at Walmart. It's just like you just
click the link and you and you're there.
Just got it on
Walmart on your Xbox. That's crazy.
Oh, you got a delayed message from your
Walmart.
Still in line at Best Buy as well.
As well.
Mario.
So, I see if when I try to um
get the Mario Kart bundle on Walmart, it
puts me in line, but when I go for just
the Switch 2 console, as I will show you
guys, it works. So, I'm going to
share this link. I'm going to spam it in
the chat. Now, people are saying that
it's not confirming a June 5th launch
day anymore,
but try it out.
Yo, I appreciate you too,
Legible. I'm glad you and your mom were
able to get it.
Target got one from Target.
Let's see. Let's
see. Walmart from your direct link.
Nice. All right. So, now my phone is
just going to be living on the Best Buy
app. I'm not touching it now.
This is crazy.
I thought Target was the goat. I think
Walmart might be the goat. And I told
you guys that Walmart was going to be my
number one.
MK World.
All right. Sorry about that.
I thought I thought my friend was
struggling to get one, but he was
actually good. Um, yo, B. Jackson, are
you serious, dude?
You made Okay, this message is going to
It's not going to make me cry. I think
I'm too tired to cry. What? This is
going to make my night.
You made me super mom.
In this stressful world, the huge hug
and smile I will get is going to fuel my
soul. I need right one for me Best Buy
bundle and one for my seven-year-old
Walmart.
Jake got me batting 1,000 in the console
drop game. Love and light to you always.
You know how to get me. I'm so happy.
That's so cool that you're a gamer, too.
You and your seven-year-old are both
going to get one. You guys can play
together.
My mom is literally my superhero. I I
told you guys I have cystic fibrosis.
Uh my mom was on her own when I was born
and they told her that my life
expectancy was 10 years
old. Uh and she refused to accept that.
She got all the cutting edge treatment
for me. I made it to my 20s and they
they told me I had a few years
left. But, you know, throughout my whole
life, you know, they said they said,
"You're going to be 10." Then more
treatments came out and they're like,
"Okay, you're going to make it to your
20s." And they're like, "Okay, you only
you're getting there." And then, but my
whole life, my life expectancy always
got pushed out. So, I never really
believed it. And a huge part of that is
from my mom. And anytime I'm struggling,
I think about what it must have been
like for my mom to be alone with two
children with cystic fibrosis and
finding out that they weren't going to
be
around. And everything I try to do is to
try to like show her how grateful I am.
She is such a wonderful woman. And you
sound like a wonderful mom, too. Damn
it, I am gonna cry. But you just remind
me of my mom. And uh
much much love. You guys
remember that new medicine came out five
years ago that that saved my life that I
started doing my YouTube when the new
medicine came out.
So yeah, love to the moms.
Ah.
All right. How How are we doing on Best
Buy, you guys?
Like, like the stream if you haven't
liked the stream.
Okay, the Mario Kart bundle is also no
longer having a queue. So, if you're
stuck in line for the bundle, you can go
out and grab the Mario Kart bundle.
Here's to you and mom J. Amazing origin
story. Thank you.
Did you do the Best Buy app and the web
browser? That's what I'm trying to do.
Yeah.
I've just I've literally just had my
Best Buy app just chilling.
Dude, Walmart has been the goat so far.
Uh I I gota I got to keep it real.
So, according to the poll,
over 9,000 of you guys have gotten it.
If I helped you get a pre-order, make
sure you vote in the poll. If you don't
see the poll, just refresh the stream.
Um, I you might be able to change your
answer. Uh, if you clicked no, but then
you you actually ended up getting it,
you can switch it to a yes. I think
Walmart Mario Kart bundle is showing as
out of stock. I'm hearing
able to get one from Walmart because of
your updates. Let's go.
Someone said they just got the Mario
Kart bundle from
Walmart. But yeah, it looks like it lets
you through and then when you try to
pre-order it shows out of
stock. People are getting kicked from
Best Buy. I don't know if you guys
remember when I was talking about this
that Best Buy was going to piss a lot of
people off. This is why. Cuz you could
have been sitting there the whole time
and it just literally never worked. It
never went through. You know what I
mean? That's why I was saying Best Buy
would if if you're lucky enough to get
through, it's great. like midnight
midnight pickup on launch day.
But it's so frustrating when it doesn't
go through.
Oh, so the out of stock it looks like
people are now being able to get it
again at Walmart.
I'm seeing more and more people saying
they got kicked.
from Best Buy.
Walmart's working. Okay, awesome.
For the people that are getting Walmart
right now, what is it saying for a
shipping date? Is it still telling you
June 5th or is it giving you uh a
further out date?
I'm seeing June 5th, but I'm also seeing
June 6th, June 8th, and June 9th.
Got the console. Walmart. Let's go.
Loris, you got June 6th? That's not
right.
That is not right.
All right, we're all right in that
window though, right?
Still still that first week, that launch
week. If you get it June 9th, June 10th,
whatever, that's a
W. There's going to be people that
aren't going to be able to get this
thing for months.
Mine got just got delayed to the sixth.
Oh, maybe mine did, too. I'll have to
check. I don't mind. I wasn't even going
to order one. All right. Well, then I
guess
that kind of happens when you come to
the streams. It kind of builds up your
hype a little bit.
All right, I'm checking on my order.
It still says arrives by release date
for my Walmart order.
Guys, if I don't if like my Best Buy
goes through and I don't see it, please
let me
know. Um, yeah, it still says June 5th
for
me. Oh, I got the I didn't even remember
if I got the bundle or not. I wanted the
Mario Kart bundle. I got the Mario Kart
bundle.
So, what I'm doing is just for science.
This is probably why I'm not going to go
through is because I opened up multiple
windows for Best Buy. So, that's
probably why it's not going to work for
me. That's why I told you not to do it.
Um, but we'll we'll see what happens at
this point.
Yeah, if you got the confirmation email,
you should be good.
success after 41 minutes.
Do you guys mind if I run an ad real
quick?
I'm just going to ask you guys and I
will I'll do a hype sesh too if we want
a hype sesh.
Okay, you guys are the most supportive
chat. I mean, you guys are always cool.
I I love my community.
Um I don't know. There has been a couple
times where where I've seen like a lot
of nos and I'm like, "Okay, cool. I
won't do it." But I appreciate you guys.
I'm running it right now.
Why am I drinking this? I only took one
sip of this whole Red Bull. Britney was
so nice to bring it to me. I'll save it
for tomorrow. I'm going to need
it. All
right. Zero sugar electrolyte. Love to
see it.
Walmart keeps coming back. It won't It
won't go
down. Crazy.
Okay. All
right. I'm seeing some people are it's
their pre-order date is getting pushed
out further from Walmart. But again, if
you get it that week, for the most part,
it's not a big deal. If you're like a
content creator or something like that,
that's kind of more of an
issue.
Um, if it happens to me, it is what it
is. I'm not gonna I'm not going to freak
out about it. I have faith in myself
that I could get one to arrive anyways,
but it's still saying June 5th for me.
Let's see. Got it through Target. How do
you know if it's canceled? Okay. Uh, you
can check your email, but the the
easiest way is to go into your account,
go to my purchases, and if it's
canceled, it will tell you there.
Yo, Austin John.
I don't I don't know how many of you
guys are familiar with Austin John Plays
on YouTube, but been a big fan for a
long time since before I even did
YouTube.
got to meet him for the first time a
couple years ago at PAX and I I really
embarrassed myself because I was like,
"Oh my god,
Austin. Um, I was a total dork, but it
was still it was it was it was exciting
for me and he was a super nice guy." So,
awesome to see him in the
chat. And then I got to see him at PAX
next year. Maybe he'll be at PAX this
year. I'm not sure.
But yeah, if anyone's going to Tax East
in Boston,
uh I I will be there. And I'm also a
special guest at Southeast Game Expo in
South Carolina in
July. Yeah, Austin John Plays is in the
chat. Yes.
I want to try to mod him, but I I can't
find him again. He's got the little
check mark.
It was a long drinking night at Barcade.
Yep. It was honestly it was in a a point
in my life where I was having a lot of
mental health issues and I was very
depressed. Uh but it was still really
fun and he was he was super kind to me
despite me making a fool of
myself. But there he is in the chat. He
he's a mod now. So he has a blue name.
He's immune to slow mode. So he can he
can he can say what up to you
guys. Just got Best Buy through the app
at 113.
Thank you for all all you do. Wouldn't
have been able to get a pre-order if it
weren't for you. I appreciate that. It
looks like if my math is correct based
on the poll, over 10,000 people have
gotten the pre-order from the
stream. You were depressed before
lockdown.
No, that was that was after lockdown
that packs.
I'm pretty sure. I'll have I'll have to
double
check. No, it definitely was
because I was single at that point and I
was I was with uh a girlfriend for like
a few years all the way through
lockdown.
And then it was the person that I was
seeing next after that girlfriend that
was really unhealthy and just Yeah.
You know how it goes, guys. But it
always gets better. You just got to hang
in there.
And take care of yourself.
Does it arrive by June 6? It depends.
They'll they'll let you know uh where it
arrives when it arrives based on when
you get it or where you get it from.
Can you tell people to check their email
because my Walmart order got cancelled
like seven times? Yikes. Okay.
I want to check my
email. Yeah. No, we're we're still good
on mine, but obviously Yeah. Check
your Oh, if you guys really want to be
homies, if you want to follow uh me and
my current girlfriend, Future Wife's
Bakery, that we just started this year,
it's the QR code above my head, and it's
also uh there's a Facebook page linked
in the description.
Uh for launch day, we're going to offer
uh four packs of uh sugar
cookies that you can buy and we'll ship
it to you. So, currently don't do I
mean, we actually do do shipping if you
message us on Facebook, which is linked,
but we're going to have special ones
like just for my channel, and they're
going to be like finger gunshaped
cookies and stuff like
that. Do we want a hype sesh? That is
the question.
You got kicked at Best Buy.
Yeah, my Best
Buy. Well, I did the thing you're not
supposed to do by having multiple
windows,
but that is also something you're not
supposed to do. I kind of did it out of
frustration.
Uh, no. I'm not going to have a booth at
packs. I'm just going to be walking
around. I'll probably like post a
picture up on Twitter, be like, "Hey,
look for me. This is my
outfit." Dressed up as Luigi and uh my
girlfriend dressed up as Mario last
year. Um, we might we might dress up.
That was actually really fun.
Walmart for the win. Got one.
Let's go. I mean,
what's really nice to to see is if you
stuck with it and didn't give up, it
seems like the average consumer was able
to get some kind of pre-order from
Walmart even without my help, right?
Like, if you stayed this
long, you were pretty much good from
Walmart, which is nice to see. I think
Walmart got all of Amazon stock because
they are by far and away the largest
retailer of the ones that were
remaining. But if you're still looking
for launch day, your best bet is to go
get in line at GameStop in a few
hours cuz they'll have instore pickup on
launch day, but only for the in-person
pre-orders. If you want to get it online
from GameStop, it's shipped to home and
that is like Target, not guaranteed to
arrive on launch day.
just got through Walmart. Money is out
of my account. When is expected to go
back in? At some point tomorrow up to a
week. So, I'm not really sure, but I'm
in the same boat as you. So, um I can
try to update you on what's going on in
my situation
uh via my YouTube uh community posts. I
I I wouldn't want to like waste people's
notifications getting that on Twitter,
but I I can put in my YouTube like
community post somewhere. That would be
fine.
So, keep an eye on that and I'll I'll
keep you updated there.
So, Kyle,
um you
uh if you're worried about cancellation
for Target, check your account. Check
your purchases. Also check your emails.
Those are the places that would pop up
if you get a cancellation.
Don't forget in my pre-order guide
video, I said that Walmart would
probably be the best
place. And I don't know.
Look what happened. I thought Target was
going to take it,
but wait, what just happened with Best
Buy? Hold on. Did it just kick it out of
my No.
Yep. It kicked it out. It just kicked me
out. That's what happened to a lot of
people. I have joined the Best Buy club
of getting booted.
Cool. Get back in
line. Love that.
Yeah, if you try to order more than one
from somewhere, it'll get cancelled at
some point. So, don't try to get two
from Walmart. The It's a bad idea.
Hey, you're welcome, Cody. I appreciate
that.
Thank you to everyone that super chatted
that I I haven't read the super chats. I
I really appreciate
you. Don't tempt fate. One per store
max. Yeah, it is an official thing on
the websites for all these retailers
that the limit is
one. And trust me, it's very common for
them to
oversell and that is when they go out of
their way to look for, you know, even if
you use a different payment method, if
it's going to the same address, stuff
like that. So, just just don't risk it.
If you need more than
one, go for separate
retailers. Exactly what I'm doing here.
Here, I'm trying to get from my friend
on Best Buy. Get mine through
Walmart. That That works perfectly for
me because I wouldn't want the midnight
launch at Best Buy because I'm going to
be streaming because there's going to be
restocks on launch day
when this stream ends. Oh, we have
111 likes. Oh, it just went up by like
100. Never mind. That was that was cool
for a second. When this stream ends,
we're probably going to
be top 10 trending in gaming. Possibly
top
five. Mainly because
it's 1:00 a.m. on a what is it?
Thursday, Wednesday? Technically, it's
Thursday now. You got Best Buy?
No, you can't get one bundle and one
non-bundle skew.
Now, if they're able to pick that up, I
mean, you might get away with it, but
yeah, I don't think it's worth uh the
risk.
Thank you, Rhonda.
So, we're still waiting for Best Buy to
like go out of stock. I mean, Walmart
might just like stay and just keep
pushing out the the date that your
system arrives.
Thank you for the text message tip for
Best Buy. Would have failed without
that. Oh, you're welcome. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. If if in case anyone finds
themselves in this situation, if Best
Buy asks you to verify your human by
sending you an email or a text message,
choose a text message. Email can take 30
minutes and that's just a waste. The
text message is pretty much always
instant. Uh, so I managed to get one
Mario one base Q from Walmart. Will one
or both eventually get cancelled?
Potentially, yes. Like I said, you could
get lucky, but I would I would cancel
one of them. I really would to protect
yourself.
All right, Walmart's out of stock.
It's okay, Walmart. You had a good run.
We appreciate you.
It looks like the Pro Controller has
been pretty easy to get.
So, I like that. The only accessory I'm
interested in, which I haven't gotten
yet, is the piranha plant.
a new account on Best Buy and it worked.
I got my order. You know
what? Let's let's let's try let's let's
play with this
chat. I'm also interested in trying an
incognito mode uh on Best Buy. You know
what? Let's try that.
best buy.com. All right, I'm just
gonna kind of I kind of hate you, Best
Buy.
Okay. Oh, people are just killing it on
on Best Buy right now. It's like coming
through.
People are
saying that using the app works really
well for Best
Buy. Best Buy is finally working. People
are saying
all right, people are finally starting
to get Best Buy. I love to hear that.
Got it on the Best Buy app.
Oh, the Best Buy is definitely
responsive. You can now choose your
store
um before you hit the add to cart button
if you re-enter it. So, if you were like
me
and got absolutely screwed with the
urine line,
I just got kicked trying again.
The app is way to go for Best Buy.
That's That's what I'm I'm
seeing. It's so funny. I'm seeing just
as many people being like, "The app is
really good for Best Buy." as I am
seeing people
say, "The app is not working for me at
all." So, I'm in line on the Best Buy
app and on my phone and it's it's not
doing anything for me. Other people are
saying Best Buy web
Okay, this is definitely going to be a
huge launch.
All right.
All right. I'm I love seeing uh
persistence being rewarded.
I think it's using my location because
it keeps trying
to have me pick up here. But again, this
is for my friend that doesn't live here.
So, we'll we'll see. Got Best Buy going
again over
here. Answer my DMs. It's a little tough
for me to do that right now.
Okay.
W.
Oh, nice. Just got to check out Best
Buy. Love to see it.
Walmart's back on. Another wave. These
are the waves that I've been talking
about.
Thanks for bearing with me, chat. I know
my energy is getting a little low, but
I'm I'm trying my best.
You're in down your leg is temporary. A
switch to is forever. I have no idea
when you said that, Elbot, but I just
saw it and it kind of made my day.
All
right, let's do a hype sesh to get us
pumped up to try to overcome this last
hurdle of Best
Buy. Hype sesh incoming.
Don't get scammed on your
[Music]
mic. Okay,
everyone. Best
Buy, the final frontier.
If you don't come through here, we're
going tomorrow morning for GameStop. I
might not have a voice, but we're still
going. But get excited again. Little
more finger guns, a little more energy.
Those that haven't gotten it, don't
stop. Keep
trying. Let's get it done.
Finger
guns coming at you.
[Music]
Heat.
[Music]
Heat. Heat. Heat. N.

I think I'm

Heat. Heat.
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
Heat. Heat.
[Music]
Oh. Oh, there we go. Sorry.
Oops. Back to normal, please. Thank
you. My Best Buy is still absolutely
cooked.
Yikes.
[Music]
This is the biggest show I've ever
seen. Oh, the best I've ever seen.
Thanks for helping everyone. I hit with
both Walmart and Best Buy. Target
screwed me and triggered multiple fraud
alerts. Trying for the Pro Controller
now.
I don't even know if I want to
cry for any accessories. I just
I really just want to try to get it for
my friend.
So, people are saying to leave Best Buy
and rejoin the line, but I already tried
that a bunch of times.
triggered multiple
and it didn't really do anything for me.
Oh, Milton, I'm so glad you got one for
Braylin.
Yo, do not cross. Let's go.
People are saying targets back. No way.
Do you see like the benefit of the
stream though? Like if you were doing
this on your own, you would have no idea
that like all these retailers would be
coming back in.
That is the value of the stream is
literally everyone working together.
Okay,
target. It already has a two star
rating. I see it as out of
stock. Yo, thank you, Alex. Alex Eert,
you're such an amazing person. and your
stories inspire me to stay strong and
keep fighting in life. You have a
forever fan. Thank you so
much. Thank
you. Okay, let's There's only five star
and one star reviews and then a single
two star review.
PS5. This might be entertaining. Let's
read the two the one twostar review.
The only review that wasn't either five
stars or one star.
Oh, is it just a star rating? It's not
a
[Music]
That's not fun.
I want to know what this person was
thinking. The only person that gave it
two stars.
All right. So Target, the app has been
working better than the website
um all day.
Guys, I've been looking forward to this
live stream for months. So, thank you so
much.
I am eternally grateful. You're such an
amazing person. Your
Thank you so much.
Just got a pre-order from Walmart. The
bundle. What is the um
Oh, just donated 100 bucks. I'm not sure
how recently you did that. I'm just
seeing it now.
Um thank you so much, Jake. I've been
watching since the PS5 released. I
managed to get two for me and my
brother. You are the goat. Thank you so
much. That is incredibly
generous. Target just
worked. Yo, Hugo, $50, dude. That is
crazy. Target is working, guys. Target
is working. I can
confirm. Actually got If you haven't
gotten it yet and you've been trying all
night, you deserve it. Please try from
Target. Please. Um, got the Switch 2 at
all three retailers. I will keep Best
Buy because I had gift certificates, but
will return Walmart and Target once
delivered. You're the best. Thanks for
everything. Yo, thank you so much, Hugo.
So, I I'm checking my DMs and multiple
people are showing me that they just got
it from Target. Target just went
through. Yeah.
Thank you, Star Fox Kid 64.
got yours to the Best Buy app. Oh,
you're you are welcome, Donkey King.
That's a good name.
Target Step. Yeah, the app has been way
better. Best Buy on Edge worked. This is
actually edge right here and it just
hasn't been working. Let me play with it
for a second. Not like that. Don't clip
that.
Got one for the wife and I threw GH Best
Buy in Walmart. Thanks for all of the
help and tips, Jake.
I mean, everywhere could potentially
cancel orders.
All right. I tried changing my store at
Best Buy and just kind of seeing if that
worked.
Yo, congratulations, Ra Shock. I
appreciate
you, man. Man, it's it blows my mind
that so many people are like able to get
at Best Buy when it's just been such a
tough one. Oh, you got it through Best
Buy in a private tab.
I love to see that.
Oh, nice. Now you don't have to worry
about camping out. That's awesome.
Rebecca, I'm glad you got yours. Angela,
I've seen you in the chat. Uh,
I I hope you're starting to find some
success.
Someone's saying to not be signed in on
Best Buy when you try to pre-order. At
this point, I'm trying everything. You
know what I mean?
Together.
Okay, someone the bundle on target is
checking out.
Guys, stop spamming. Is Walmart
canceling orders? I've answered that
question like 15 times.
There's no mass cancellations from
Walmart. That's that's the last time.
Uh, let's see.
Got one from Walmart. Love to see it.
Got one from Best Buy 15 minutes ago.
Congrats, Justin.
Got yours from Best Buy.
Yeah, if you if you accidentally ordered
more than one from Walmart, but you
canceled one, you should be okay.
Yeah, target app is way better.
Hey, congratulations
outright. Just got Best Buy. Yeah, Best
Buy was the last to go, so it makes
sense that they would last the
longest.
Got it on. Thank
Stay with my
retired. If this is too hard and you
want to quit, that's no problem. I would
say get some sleep. And if this is too
difficult for you, you still can show up
to your Best Buy before they open and
just pre-order in person. So, if you've
gone through this whole process and
you're like, "Screw this. I' I've been
up, take like a little nap, get yourself
over to Best Buy at like 4:00 or 5:00
a.m. Sit in a chair. When they open,
just pre-order in
person. But if you are still going to
try, Target and Best Buy is the way to
go. And also you can try online tomorrow
at GameStop too.
If if Target's not working for you, try
this. Do the tip where you favorite it
by clicking the little heart right here
and then try to try to add it to your
cart through the favorites.
Just got it from Target after clearing
fraud alerts. Again, if you use PayPal,
you don't have to worry about the fraud
alerts. PayPal or Apple Pay.
People are saying try the controller
bundle on Best Buy.
I mean, I've in the background, I've
low-key been trying a lot, which
probably hurts my uh my best buy
chances. Got your confirmation. Thanks.
Oh, yeah, of course.
Best hang.
[Music]
got.
I don't even see the controller
bundle. Maybe that's why it was easier
to get
I don't have to go
out around 20 minutes ago.
Wilder thing. Can you help me get a PS5
5 years ago and helped me secure the
Switch 2 tonight? Hey, congrats
team. Kevin, uh, got the Walmart and the
Target bundle, but haven't seen emails
from either. Target keeps canceling me.
I got one from Walmart.
Got mine from Best Buy after two
canceled orders from Target.
Yeah, my this Best Buy has just been
garbage for me.
Oh, you went with the uh the Donkey Kong
bundle.
Should I go to bed or
after hours of trying? My fiance just
opened up the Target app and got on the
first try. Let's go.
I hate I hate Best Buy the way they do
it so much.
be patient. Stay. I mean, I'm staying in
line. I I do kind of like it when I
don't get through. So, at least you can
see that cuz sometimes when you see all
these people getting it in chat, you
feel like you're the only one. But look,
I'm the pro and I'm having the same
problems at Best Buy. So, it does it is
luck is a big part of it.
Just got in from Best Buy. Fifth time in
line.
All right, let's see.
All right, I'm trying I'm trying the uh
the Pro Controller bundle and seeing
what what happens there.
error when
Stick with it, guys. Uh, got it in Best
Buy app 3 minutes ago. Couldn't find my
wallet. Almost
almost missed out. Best Buy mobile.
Yeah, people keep saying
that. So, when you say Best Buy mobile,
you're you're saying not like the
regular Best Buy app.
Hold on. I don't want to confuse anyone
else or
myself. This is trash. I got one, but
it's still garbage. I I feel that
frustration.
Yeah. No, you just mean the Best Buy
app. Okay.
All right, we're going to put Best Buy
over here.
This is absolutely a nightmare. I agree
with you.
Yo, Matthew
Williams, like like I told you, I'll
donate a Hyundo if I got it. The main
reason I wanted this was from my younger
brother who said that he wanted it but
doesn't have any money for it. I'm so
thankful to you in the chat for keeping
me and everyone updated. Matthew
Williams, you were hyping up the stream.
You were being supportive of everyone
else in the chat all stream long, dude.
Thank you so much. You already had given
back so much. And
uh I do remember you saying that and I
and if I have to be honest, I didn't
really believe it at the time.
and uh you are certainly a man of your
word. So, shout out to Matthew Williams.
So, people are saying the Best Buy Mario
Kart bundle sold out, but I don't know
about all those random bundles it
has. Um, so I'm still kind of kind of
trying for those.
Ah, thanks
Caleb. All of the bundles that come with
Mario Kart are
gone. That's what That's what people are
saying.
All right.
So, if this is what ends up happening,
GameStop is the play tomorrow. And if
this is too much for you, get see if you
could still have time to get in line at
your local GameStop. Thank you, Off-Road
SP. Yo, I I appreciate you a lot, man.
Uh, followed your tips and got a
pre-order at
each. Oh, thank you, Santo. Yeah, I'm
I'm going to be trying for my friends
still. That's the thing is he needed it
to come from Best Buy, so
I'll have to try
at a future one.
Yeah, Best Buy says coming soon again.
When Best Buy says coming soon, that's
their version of being like, "All right,
we're really
cooked." But it's just the Mario Kart
bundle ones.
that um that have that
anything on Best Buy that had the Mario
Kart bundle
version is sold out, but the ones that
have the standalone
console are not.
Just got the controller bundle on Best
Buy. Yeah, that's what I've been in line
for and I've been having the same bad
luck.
got from Walmart.
Um, if you guys have not hit the like
button, Let's see if getting like up to
12,000 likes 12,500 likes.
Let's Let's see if that gives us a
little bit of luck. See if that just
magically makes Best Buy
work. Uh Pablo, yo, thank you for the
10. Tried to target. Got a PayPal
confirmation, but no Target email yet.
O, go to your account on Target and
check your
um check your like past purchases. It'll
be there as canled or as
pending. You got the Pro Controller
bundle on Best Buy with no
incognito/private tab.
cancelled
from the
I think we're like 52 subscribers away
from hitting 2,000 subscribers
uh ad during the stream, too, which is
crazy. So, thank you to all the new
people after 1 hour and 54 minutes of
pure stress. Thanks to you, I secured
one and incredibly grateful. Came
through a few minutes ago when Target
released more and Best Buy after being
kicked out three
times. It took an hour for me to get the
console at Best Buy. Patience would have
given up
remember the amount of people that are
still trying to get it whether it's
because people already got it or they've
given up is so much less now. So, you
know, like that that cartoon where it's
like it shows two people trying to mine
for like diamonds and it shows one
person who's like really sad and he
gives up, but you can see there's only a
little bit of dirt left to the
diamonds. And then there's the other one
who just like it decides they're not
going to give up. Yo, Matthew Williams,
congrats,
dude. Jordan, thanks for your help
tonight. Caught you with grub this
morning. Follow your advice and lock
down switches for my buddy and me. I
hope everyone can grab one. Yo, thank
you so much. Lots of people coming from
Jeff Grub.
Really cool to have like new people find
the channel. I love
Jeff. I'll be on So, I was on Jeff I was
on Giant Bomb with Jeff Grub today. I'm
going to be on the spawn cast uh on
Saturday. So, you can catch me again in
the morning for another stream. And then
if you want to see me in a more relaxed
environment, uh you can catch me on the
spawn cast which is on Spawn Waves
channel on Saturday.
People are still getting from Target,
huh?
Yo, Francisco Roblace, thank you for
joining the Jakey
Gang. Don't forget to uh like my tweet
if a pre-order did come
through. Based on the poll, it looks
like we've helped 15,000 people at least
get one so
far. Oh, you're here because of the
spawn wave shout out. Cool. Well, yeah,
I'll be I'll be on his channel, man.
I've uh he's had me on the podcast
before when the PS5 stuff was going on.
John's a great
guy. How long would it be before Target
pre-order holders don't have to worry
about cancellations anymore?
I mean, you never really know until they
ship,
unfortunately. Oh, I'm sorry about that,
Pablo.
Here comes the spawn waves. Thank cuz
you're awesome. Thank you. My voice has
taken so many turns tonight. Like when I
first started losing it, I sounded like
a little child and now I'm just I don't
even know what I sound like. Sound like
an edgy teenager
now.
Uh GB fan since 08. Didn't know about
you today. Thanks for the advice. Got a
Mario Kart bundle and a Pro Controller.
Let's
go. Best Buy logged my out, couldn't
verify my email, forced a password
reset, logged back in, checked out, and
placed my order right after. Oh, weird.
Hate Best Buy.
Um, I forget what Walmart delivers with.
Um, I would wait. Wait as long as you
can to cancel from Target. The pending
authorization should give you the money
back. So then you can just like wait cuz
it won't actually charge you until it
ships. GameStop camp out. Dude, I
am I am inclined to go to my GameStop
and take a picture after the stream cuz
uh
Britney texted me like an hour after she
left here when she dropped off the Red
Bull and stuff and she's like, "I just
was driving home and I
saw we already have campers at our
GameStop." So, I'm curious what it's
like right now. I wonder if any of them
are watching the stream
even. Dude, should I just pull up and
blast the hype sash song and just start
doing finger guns in the GameStop
parking lot?
Hey,
D, that's all. Thank you so much. I'm
glad that you got it on Target, man.
That's awesome.
That's crazy that you've been
pre-ordering since the SNES. You're a
legend, dude.
Hey, thank you, Jay.
Yeah, if you guys are were able to get
it, um, I'd love to see how many likes I
can get on that pin tweet that I have on
Twitter X, whatever the heck you want to
call
it. Twitter X. Brain dead bird app.
Brain Dead Alphabet
app. Had to restart your phone and
rejoin the line. Screw it. I'm literally
going to turn off my phone.
I'm I'm getting desperate, chat. I I
know some of you guys are there with me.
I know I'm not the only one.
Walmart's back up. Walmart just keeps on
coming.
Not like that. Don't clip that.
Let me get a PS5. Now you helped get
Nintendo Switch finger guns up. Let's
go.
Walmart keeps pushing out bundles here
and there. Let's go. But yeah, Celtics
up two two nothing,
baby. Thank you so much. Finally secured
the bag at Walmart. Oh, you're welcome,
Jeff. Let's go, dude.
All right.
Yes, exactly. Best Buy charges you the
full amount, but then it goes back into
your account either the next day or
within a few days, and it doesn't charge
you for real.
Uhoh, I got the sold out message on Best
Buy.
It charges you for real uh when it's
ready for pickup at the store. Yo,
Patwire, thank you so much. It's great
to see you.
Yo, Dragon Sword, Ethan Frederick,
Abstract Eclipse
Productions. Um, Nagato, Sashmi, Adam
Baldwin. Yeah, if you finally got it
from uh from Best Buy.
Well, I would wait I would wait a couple
days to cancel anywhere. I really would,
you guys.
[Music]
Yeah, I'm getting a sold out. Hold on.
Yep.
Best Buy, I hate you.
Yo, thank you, Jay. I appreciate that.
Thank you, Captain Salty.
Yep. Best Buy never went through for me.
All right. Can I at least get the
piranha plant
camera? I can.
I'm going to take apart the Piranha
Plant camera
and install a 1080p camera instead of
the 480p camera it comes from. It comes
with and I'm going make a video on it on
the channel. Yo, Pavlam, what's up,
dude?
Hopefully you were successful, brother.
All right, guys. The game
plan. I'm looking forward to this
project. I appreciate that,
Elbot. Here's the game plan. Let's re
Let's regroup for a second here. Okay.
Mario.
Oh, GameStop tomorrow morning for the
tradein discount.
Uh, Vexus, that means you're pretty
golden, dude. That means you're pretty
golden. All
right, let me just Oh, Jesus. All right.
uh you to prepare yourself for trying to
order from online at GameStop tomorrow.
Like I said, if you get up early, like,
you know, 600 7 a.m., you want to drive
by your local
GameStop cuz they have the amount that
there is available posted on the door.
So, you can ask the last person in line,
"Hey, what number are you? Is there any
left?" And if you want to just do it in
person, do that. But if you want to
try for
um you want to try for online at
GameStop, that is tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.
Eastern, 10:00 a.m. Central, 9:00 a.m.
Mountain time, and 800 a.m. Pacific
time.
And I have a guide on Best Buy where
after this stream ends, the next stream
I'm gonna create it for. But if you
search Jake
Randall GameStop guide, it's for the
PS5, but it shows you tips for their
website. The only thing about that one
is GameStop is the only retailer that
has drastically changed the way
um people are saying that the Mario Kart
bundle is now back at Best Buy, by the
way. So, we're going to take a look at
that.
But, so now like the standalone console
bundles are gone. Yep, you are
correct. Mario Kart bundle is back.
Crazy. I think that Best Buy hates me to
be honest.
Yeah, I got one from Walmart, but I'm
trying to get one from my
friend. Yes, it happens in waves. If you
watch my guides, you would know that.
But what I was about to say for GameStop
[Music]
um
was that that guide, it's only six
minutes, so definitely watch it still,
but just be aware that they they kind of
have a Q system they use sometimes
now. Um you haven't already, screw you.
I
mean, why should my friend not be able
to get one just because he has to work
overnight on at
midnight? Sorry for trying to help
him. Uh, all right.
Well, Walmart being a goat surprise me.
I try to help you.
But yeah, watch the GameStop guide ahead
of time. Here is a here's a tip that's
really going to help you. It's gonna
help you um for GameStop. It's gonna
give you a massive advantage
when you click the links that like you
see in my description. Of course, I'm
going to provide them, but when you use
those links or you click the links you
see on Twitter for GameStop
specifically, it sometimes won't load.
Like you see how you saw how Best Buy
wouldn't show the add to cardart for
forever. With GameStop, if you use links
that lots of people are using, it'll do
that even when it is loaded. So, what
you want to do is generate your own link
by going to
gamestop.com, searching switch to, and
then clicking the product yourself, and
bookmarking that link. So, if it's your
link that you generated
yourself, it will work way better than
the links that you just see people
posting.
Yeah, I see that the Mario Kart bundle's
gone
again. Yikes.
Yeah, I just like I cannot get Best Buy
to work.
I'm dreading having to tell my friend
that I couldn't get it for him, but
we'll we'll
see. Thank you so much for this. I got
the nom bundle from the Walmart app
without a queue. The relief I feel is
amazing. Couldn't have done it without
you. Hey, thank you so
much. Yeah, I'm in the Best Buy app.
It's sold out everywhere on the
app. At least a video proof that I never
stopped trying. That is true. That is
true. I'm going to be like, "Hey,
watch this sixhour live
stream. Just scored at Best
Buy." Crazy.
Yep. For me, it won't even populate.
Pets Smart. Let's go.
Best Buy only worked once I did a
private tab, not signed in. That's what
this one is right here.
Oh,
cool. Every single tab I have open just
minimized, including my
stream. That kind of thumbs up how I
feel about everything to be honest.
I don't know where my chat went.
All right, we got a new check on here on
my end.
All right,
guys. There are even though thousands of
people got one, there are thousands of
people that didn't get one on this
stream. So, please know I'm not
abandoning you. Like, I'm not giving up
on you.
launch day isn't for
over a month and there's going to be
more restocks sporadically coming in.
One of the best things you can do is
follow myself and Elbot on Twitter. So,
both of our Twitters are linked in the
description. Follow us
both for when restocks happen, we'll
post the links. Following both of us is
definitely preferred. Typically, Elbot
will be faster than me.
um nine times out of 10, but we'll we'll
be like within seconds of each other.
But those seconds can matter.
But then what I the value I add on
Twitter is also when I'm not streaming,
all these tips I've been telling you on
the stream, I put into the tweets. As
you might have seen if you've been
following me for a
while. Yo, I appreciate you, Tyler.
All right. It looks like
it looks like it's about
time to to hit it. I'm going to run an
ad real quick and then I'm going to I'm
going to give you my my closing speech
for the stream.
And tomorrow we're going to kick the
stream off with a hype sesh.
So here it is without Mario Kart. It's
sold out either way now. Just just so
everyone in the chat knows.
I'm telling you, Walmart's the biggest
retailer out of all these. Walmart's
bigger than all three of these combined
as a company. And because the only one
that rivals them is Amazon. And because
Amazon doesn't get any, it would make
sense that Walmart got all the
stock a thousand%.
[Music]
That is one of the reasons that I said
that Walmart was going to be my
go-to. Yeah, Sam's Club never dropped.
New Egg never dropped. So, those are
other alternatives if you didn't get it
tonight to watch out for those. And
following myself and Elbot on Twitter
will let you know when those do go
live. Thank you. I was able to get them
for my household. You are welcome,
Hannah.
Okay, the ad did not start. I'm going to
run the ad now.
All
right. Hopefully the ads coming coming
down, guys. 12,000 likes on stream is
unfathomable to me. My goal, and I
thought it was a bit of a stretch, was
to get 5,000 likes.
So obviously if you're coming to the
stream to try to get a pre-order like
you know you're that's why you're coming
but you don't have to then like the
stream. So for you to like take the time
to show the gratitude and all the super
chats absolutely
crazy. You guys know like you don't have
to ever do that but the fact that so
many of you guys have shown your
appreciation like that tonight is I'm
very grateful. It's all going to go into
my bakery to be
honest.
Um, but tomorrow morning as soon as this
live stream ends, I'm not going to go to
bed because I'm going to Thank you.
Thank you,
Kyle. Angela, you're still here. Angela.
Angela, it's my mission to help you get
one from GameStop tomorrow. Angela, you
weren't able to get it from Walmart.
Well, it's it's my mission to get it for
everyone from GameStop tomorrow that
didn't get it.
Going to do another bakery giveaway
soon, too, once this all calms down. Oh,
you're the goat. Elot bought a bunch of
stuff from my bakery and let me give it
away to people. And it he just said he
was going to do it again at some point.
So, follow for that. We'll send you some
cookies, some
brownies. Remember, follow my bakery.
You can scan the QR code. Check the link
in the
description. Keep saying error on my
app. Okay. Um, what happens if you go
right now just on the website, not the
app? Out of stock. Okay,
fair. I I got you guys. I'm really going
to try to help you from from one of
these other retailers, especially
GameStop, tomorrow. But as soon as this
live stream ends, I'm going to be
working on setting up tomorrow's live
stream for GameStop. I'll be changing
this text. I'll be updating the
description. Um, all that stuff. Just
just getting it ready to go. So, I'm
going to get a little bit of sleep. Um,
I might drive to my GameStop just to get
a little peek. I'm super curious.
I don't want to I don't want to be out
too late, but it it could be kind of
fun. Yeah. To the people who haven't
gotten one, don't give up. I just want
to remind you guys getting the PS5 was
even harder than this. It was almost
impossible. And I got my pre-order
cancelled by one of my own
viewers. And I ended up getting my PS5
not from any of my pre-order live
streams, but on my launch day live
stream. Launch day, there'll be a huge
amount of stock. And you know what? If
you get one today or you get one on
launch day, you you all get it the same
day.
So, hang in
there. I love you guys. I appreciate you
guys. Uh check on this stream later.
You'll probably see it on trending.
So, tomorrow I'm gonna go live probably
at 8:30 a.m. So, we'll we'll have our
morning coffee together 8:30 a.m.
Eastern time, which is like 2 and a half
hours before the restock starts.
Um, maybe I'll even go live earlier. I
don't know, maybe 8 a.m.
I don't want to go crazy with it, but I
I do want to get a little bit of sleep.
Thank you, TrackMon. Thank you. Um Oh,
YouTube's not going to load. Thank you
outright again. Thank you so much,
man. And
Drear, yeah, don't cancel yet, Drear.
Give it a few days before you do any
cancelling. So, GameStop goes live
tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. Eastern. And
again, I I'm going to update the stream
to have all that, but 11:00 a.m.
Eastern,
um 8:00 a.m.
Pacific. Target doesn't take your money.
It's a pending authorization. It'll
automatically go back. It wasn't an
actual
charge. Is the bakery in Texas or
California? It is in New Hampshire.
Uh thank you, Mark. I I do know about
hottock. Yeah.
Everywhere is a limit one. If you It'll
let you order more than one. They'll
just cancel it on you later if you do
that. Been a blast as always. So glad
you got shown the appreciation you
deserve. Thank you guys. Walmart has
stock. All right, Angela, before you
go. What stock do they have? The the
bundle. Yeah, I don't I don't see it.
Thank you for that, Dr. Cly. I
appreciate
it. The app shows you Q time. Yeah, it's
completely sold out. I didn't mind
checking. I don't think people were
intentionally trying to troll, but yeah,
it's definitely sold out for now on
Walmart. Sold out Best Buy. It's sold
out Target.
GameStop is going to be the place. But
don't sleep on Sam's Club and New Egg as
well. All right, hold on. We'll play
around with this a
second. Yeah, it's it's really not
showing anything for me at Walmart.
If you're still in the queue, I
personally don't think it's possible.
GameStop is doing the midnight launch in
store, but only if you pre-order in
person, not
online. Oh, it's possible to get it from
Walmart if it's in your cart. Okay.
Yeah, that would that happens sometimes.
Okay. So, I think the way Walmart works
is if it's showing sold out for you, it
means your region. Yes, exactly. Someone
just said it in the chat. It could be
regional. So, I think it I I just had to
think about it for a second. But yeah,
it means your region like the warehouse
that's going to be shipping to
everywhere like around where you live is
out of stock. So for me, it's it's it's
gone. But if you live in a different
part of the country, a different region,
it might not be completely sold out yet.
So it is worth it to check on both the
bundle and the standalone at Walmart one
more time before you go to
bed. But if you don't see it,
that's it. And uh if you had fun
tonight, you did get your pre-order and
you want to come back and just vibe
tomorrow, you are more than welcome.
Um you would be very helpful to the
people that are still trying to get it
because while they're focusing on
getting it, you can say things in the
chat. I can read it
out. Okay.
They are doing a midnight release at
Best Buy. Yes, 100%
confirmed. Um, on launch day, every Best
Buy will be open till
midnight. Most Best
Buys. Gota got to be careful with that.
I love vibing. Let's
go. All right, guys. I
need I need
to set up the next
stream. How How long were we live for?
10 minutes and it will have
been 6 hours. Really? It felt like it
was longer than six hours. Not that six
hours is a short amount of time,
but All right. Goodbye you guys. I love
you. Thank you so much again for coming
to the stream. If you're super
frustrated, if you're upset right now, I
totally get your pain. I mean, see me
here being excited for everyone that was
able to get it, but I don't want you to
feel on scene. Uh you can totally vent
in the chat. You can You're allowed to
be
upset. You know, be upset. Come back
fresh tomorrow or take a break if you
need to. Mental health comes first. But
I'm going to do everything I can. I
still need to help out, my friend. So,
we'll figure it out. Thank you guys all

heck? It literally just came back and
everyone has given up right now.
Angela, if you're in the chat, please
try. Walmart literally just came back
from my
region. Check it out. Okay, just just

life. I think you're Yeah, I kind of
do. Thank you, Rebecca. Yeah, I've been
trying to get the piranha plant cam at
Best Buy for a while and it just Best
