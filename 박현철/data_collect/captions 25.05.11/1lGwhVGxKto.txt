Yeah, we fine. The smoke is bugged or
something. Do you see smoke? I need to
replacement. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm at
the edge. I'm outside of it, but Oh,

Look, this little motorcycle is eating
my smoke, dude. It's It's overheating.
That's all. Pretty sure that's how smoke
works. It's realistic, dude.
I I can't go down like that anymore.
Well, air drop 320 we go. It's not that
far. Yeah.
Yeah. I think we should get you that
three gear, dude. You're punching bag
this game. I
don't I don't
know. I feel like you should take it.
But you've been knocked. I haven't been
knocked. I don't think Oh, that's not
true. I've been knocked once.
These flare covers are heavy,
huh?
27. Wow, they're really heavy. In that
lowqua zing area. Uh, I don't know. I
just saw Okay. I just saw
320 airdrop. Not that far.

Should I take it? You sure? You want it?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Enjoy.
Hey, we got to go somewhere to get me

One's knocked in front of us. I know you
need sevens, but Oh, I have enough to
fight. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you do. I see a
guy. Y do I shoot? Up to
you. Nice shot. Stop at
the N by that guy. Nice trade, Bob. I
didn't have a good play there. I like
wanted to protect Bob where I parked and
also I don't know. I know. I know. No,
no. Everything's good.
Cuz I think there's still another team
somewhere. They were still fighting
someone.
You want to know the magic of that?
What? I shot at the other guy and killed
his teammate. Uh,
calculated. Great
shot. That saved the day because like,
yeah, that was a tough pull up.
Actually, if I was playing solo, I would
have driven differently, but I just had
to do that. I think nos had to just put
myself in a position where like when I
get out of the car, I'd have no cover. I
got
deleted. I have 80. There's a glider
250. Just take some shots at
it. This guy has zipline gun,
dude. Wow. Here's some sevens on my
ping. 60.
Nice. Um, oh, and even more. There's
some dead guys. More. Should be more
dead guys somewhere.
Okay, I'm I'm juiced now. Okay,
second glider.
I don't think we're in.
Okay, I hear it.
[Music]
And a
parachuter way out. 240 just slow
flying.
It's annoying that I can't apply a
default skin. He's dodging the glider.
The glider's trying to hit him.
Oh, somebody hit him. Hit him. Oh,
Nelly. We're going to crash maybe. Yep.
Two cars. I think there's just one in
each car. I knocked this
guy. This guy made a mistake. Yeah, the
the close one. The other guy's still up
there. Someone stole my kill from behind
behind us. Yep. Other car guys at the
rock on your ping.
That shot. Was that me? See, I'm looking
at yellow ping for a
second. Wonder if he hit this guy. He's
not peeking at all. There he
goes. Okay, this guy is just not
interested.
Okay, I'm going to come help look. I'm
not looking at the other guy anymore.
And to the right of yellow at on the top
of the hill, they're
out. True. This isn't a very good
peak. Backing up to check rock guy
again. I looked to the rock.
He's there. Is he? Hit him. I hit him
twice. He's at the rock. Left or right
side? He was peeking right side.
We are not in a great We have cars
though. Everything's fine. I think these
guys are moving down right. I might have
just seen one.
Okay, I'm going to move one of these
cars.
I think we just get it. Go push that guy
at the rock and kill.
He's going for tires. That rock guy.
He's dead. He's dead. Nice. I think we
just take his spot and we get these
other dudes out. Yeah, he got one of our
tires. The dossia has all of its wheels.
I think this one should have all Okay,
coming. These guys are being weird.
Where'd they
go? I'm in
Maybe they went for the water play.
There's no better way to spend six. See
those guys that were bolting? Yeah, I
don't know where they
went. Maybe they went really
wide. That might be them getting into a
fight. Oh, visions is in our game. Wow.
sniper. Yeah,
true. Where's this guy's body at? Behind
us. Right here. Close. Just lining me
up. Knocked one.
Oh, I'm getting hit from another team.
That's not
Okay. Yeah, they might be shooting me
right now. I'm by I'm healing. I'm going
to be fine. Same.
Oh, I'm getting shot from a distance
from south. Do you need emergency flare
cover or you good? No, no, no. I'm good.
I'm good. I could smush you if you want.
Not to Not this game. Okay.
These guys are on yellow. I think they
might be free kills. There's still a
glider flying
around. Okay, maybe I'll come to you.
I'm going to come to you guys from
behind. Stop shooting me. I think
they're just
rotating. Where are we going to go here?
Okay. Yeah, cuz if these guys are out
over here Oh, they're close. So, they're
dead. I still think there's someone over
by yellow.
Okay, I'm looking. Oh, yeah. I see them.
They're moving up the cliff. My thing,
two of them. They're not. I don't know.
I can't tell what they're
doing. They're running. One just one is
literally disappearing on my screen.
Like he keeps disappearing.
I see
him on the left. He's prone. He's dead.
Nice. One more there.
Is he going to beat
this? This is so awkward. He doesn't
know what to do. He's pushing a little
bit.
He's sitting still shooting. I can't hit
him. Yeah, me
neither. Jeez. Nice shot. Can I hit this
guy? That guy was There's someone
shooting an up or something in the in
the place here. How am I paying?
You want to take them? I
guess or whatever. We need to like move
along the wall. I'm going to check these
guys for some
things. Maybe it's one of the guards. I
don't think it is though.
You don't have to go in there. Just play
along the What's this? This is actually
a juicy dip. We should play yellow on
yellow. Okay. All right. I might die for
this, but
this is a juicer.
Not I just saw something else disappear.
What's going on? Are there ghosts? They
had ghosts in the last
update. Spooky ghosts. Wow, that is a
juicy dip. Oh
yeah. Fighting over here. Shots from our
right. Visions is killing everyone in
the whole
game. Oh, Visions died or got knocked.
No, that's what you get for stream
sniping.
He didn't know where we were. I was
running ads.
One's in the open on my ping. Dude, he's
in this bush.
I'm just shooting the bush.
Careful of I know.
Yeah. Being stupid right now.
Team driving up. But this guy doesn't
know that we have the anti weapon.
They're good. They're like I'm putting
emergency flare covers down near these
trees. One guy in the
car. Dead. Dead. Oh, I made a
mistake. I'm fine. I was thought I was
getting smooshed.
Is that guy still up in those smokes
over there? Uh I think there's that team
is still alive. it. I think there might
be two of them up there. They're smoking
yellow.
Yeah, there's two of them. I think that
looks like a different
dude. They're not in, are they? No,
they're out. They're way
out. There's an unknown team. Like,
there's a team on the right, but then
there's also an unknown somewhere.
Oh, I said I'm fine. Yeah. Yeah. They
could even be behind us or something,
dude. Watch out. Yellow.
Watch
out at this tree. I can't hit him.
He's running out in the street. They're
like in here in this smoke now. Okay.
I think that was the solo and he died.
Oh yeah, you might be right.
Just kidding.
Well, I think there's a duo at the road
and a duo on our
right. I just can't see anyone at the
moment. One's
knocked. One's dead to
zone. That guy's one HP running in. He's
dead to zone. Yeah, he's dead. Yep. It
was RL Stein. No.

He's in this little dip. What do we do
to this guy? I don't know. I'm throwing
a grenade. It's my only move. It's my
secret
move. I'm going to shoot the
smoke. See if I get lucky.

do something. Yeah. Yeah. Should I
weaken him? No, I'm not. I could I could
smoke him. I have a I have a C4. Hold

zone comes, I'm going to throw the C4
down and make him go in and smoke.

delay. He's He's smoking everything,

to die, Bob. I am. I'm dead.
No, no, no.
He's at the rock. Oh.
in the You think so? Yeah, he's in the
bush. Maybe.
Uh-oh. This is the end.
I swear he's in that bush straight
through the end. Okay.
No. Yeah. How do we not hear the audio
of him running away? Uh, well, he's far
from me. He's so movement. He's so
movement. He's so movement played.
