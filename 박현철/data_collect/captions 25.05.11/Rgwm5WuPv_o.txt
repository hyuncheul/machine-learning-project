Can't believe Nintendo made me wake up
this [ __ ] early in the morning, bro.
Like, who do they think they are? Who do
they think they are making me do this
[ __ ] Who do they think they are making
me do this? I'm waking up at at at I
have my alarm set at [ __ ] 755. Bro,
who do they think they are?
Hope you all are all doing well and
wonderful
today. Shay, it's 3 p.m. in my country.
Well, congratulations. I'm glad it's 3
p.m. for you. It's [ __ ] It is 8:49 in
the morning here where I'm at.
Did you hear Nintendo direct today? No,
I'm streaming for no reason today.
Clueless.
I hope it's Shay 2 by mistake. Damn. Big
fan. Yo, bud. Thank you for the 37
months. Appreciate
you. Here. I can put on some music while
we wait.
We got like 10 minutes until it starts.
So, and for once, check this. Check
this. Just one time in my whole
life. Look at Isn't it beautiful? They
used a white background so they're not
blasting my [ __ ] screen with with
with red like normal. Every time I do
one of these streams, I swear they just
blast me with a [ __ ] with a with a
dash of red. Can my camera be centered
one time? It's all I really want. There
we go. No, that's too that was too far
left. Let's find the balance. There we
go.
Beautiful. White is worse in the dark.
Yeah, but I'm not in the dark. I have
big [ __ ] lights shining on me right
now. Oh my god. Like four people just
got automoded by Twitch because they
typed white is
worse. No
[Laughter]
way. That's really
funny. Twitch Twitch thought y'all were
being racist.
That's
crazy. Oh
no. What time do you usually wake up?
Seven isn't that bad. I don't wake up at
[ __ ] the dog. I stay up until like
midnight. I ain't waking up at 7.
Hello. Been waking up at like 9:30
lately. Oh yeah. I said I would put some
music on, right? I should do that.
Nintendo donated $5. There will be no
mentions of the Nintendo Switch success.
Oh, wait. Our
[Laughter]
bad. Ah, that's loud. Holy [ __ ] [ __ ]
Calamity jump scare.
No community note must be
true. I guess I can do my TCG pocket
pulls
again. Okay, I got to show you what my
brother just texted me. I I texted him
this morning complaining about waking up
early and he [ __ ] texts me
[Laughter]
that he has to wake up at like 6:00 in
the morning every day for his job.
So that's funny.
I got hit with a wamp wamp. Yeah, for
real. All right, we got seven minutes
until it starts and I have two [ __ ]
packs to open.
Yeah. Yo, Ellie, think of the 17. Meow.
Three.
Yo, so true.
Maybe I'll finally open one of those god
packs that the kids are talking
about. Put a blue filter over yourself.
Why? Why do a blue filter when I can
simply
just Oh, hold
on. There we
go. All
right, back to
white. Nope. Nothing in these two packs.
Damn, that's crazy. I'm going to open
10. I got a [ __ ] ton of hourglasses.
So, shiny Shay.
Yeah. All right. Let's see here. Open 10
packs. Yes. I would like to use my 120
hourglasses. Let's
go. Pack one. Absolutely [ __ ]
nothing. Pack two. Oh. Oh, there's a
shiny in the back of this
one. Oh, it's No, it's real, though.
Look at that. I didn't have that one
yet. That's good.
Y I always like that I slide it to the
side to see what's at the back of the
pack so I can temper my
expectations. Yo, I got I got the guy
the bozo. No way. That's crazy.
Your ping failed in the
Discord,
huh? Yeah, it does have a lack of
reactions. Wait a minute.
What? What the heck?
Somebody made a roll call that
everyone. Okay, let me redo
that and may make sure I'm pinging the
correct at everyone this time. Notify
everyone who has permission to view this
channel. Here we
go. There. Now it should
work. Nope. Well, that's okay. Who the
[ __ ] specifically said not to ever do
this again because it [ __ ] this up. God
damn it. Hold on. I got to go find this
roll. Yeah, here we
go. I got to go delete this roll. I
specifically said, "Please never do this
again because it [ __ ] up
pings." Yes, delete the everyone roll.
Okay, third time's the charm this time
because Discord is a small indie
software
moment. There. There it gave me the
heads up for for pinging people. There
we go. It worked that time.
Yeah, see that was what happens when you
make a meme roll called at everyone. Uh,
Discord um is programmed by imbeciles
and it cannot properly distinguish the
two and we'll always prioritize the
role. This happened when we had people
with every in their
name. I remember we used to have
somebody in the community, they they
used to go by EV and I would type in at
everyone and it would auto correct to at
Eevee after I even after I had typed at
everyone and it would just ping them and
it was like a whole
thing. Oh, we got something in the back
of this one. Holy crap, it's
freaking
tattoo
goober. Kind of a boring pack opening.
I'm not going to lie. I didn't really
get that much in this
one. All right, shut up, music. It's
It's time. The time is here. The time is
upon us. Go. Desktop capture mode. Holy
crap. It's the Nintendo Switch,
too. I don't get to see this damn
thing. I now have 68 of 72 in this set.
I'm in need of a couple more goobers and
then I will be finished with
it. Though, once I finish all the other
sets, I'll probably go back to opening
this one just because it has a lot of uh
fun uh chase cards in it.
Pokemon does that really well. I wish
Yu-Gi-Oh did
that. Oh, here we go. Oh, they have a
countdown. They They That's
crazy. Look at them actually using a
YouTube
feature. I used this one time for
Calamity and I didn't know how it
worked. I thought it would just do a
countdown like before the launch. No, it
starts like if you schedule something
for 9 and have a 3minut countdown. The
3minute countdown starts at
9. Not a YouTube
feature. Well, I mean YouTube's counter
allows you it allows you to customize
it. You can make a completely custom
one. So, I assume that's what they did
here.
Holy crap. It's the Nintendo Switch,
too. Oh, we opening up with a game right
[Music]
away. Ball.
Finally, the main character
[Music]
ball. That was just their logo. Hold on.
That was a little loud. There we go.
That's better. Don't want to be too
loud. All right. What you got for me,
big
[Music]
N? Is this Mario Kart?
Let's go.
Ah, I see retro art style has infected
even [ __ ] Mario Kart. Let's
go. Thank god we're done with the noodle
limbs era and we're back to like
cartoony proportions.
Is that a snowmobile she was just
[Music]
riding? What the
Yo, bro. Think Yo, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Bro, thinky Sonic, what going on
here? They be grinding rails and doing
[ __ ] triangle jumps. What's going on
here? What?
[Music]
Hello.
[Music]
Can
way finally
cow. Mario Kart World. That looks
awesome.
Hello everyone. I'm Koichi Kamoto and
I'll be one of your guides for today's
Nintendo Direct.
I'm the producer for Nintendo Switch 2.
I'm Takuhiro Dota, the director for
Nintendo Switch 2.
And I'm Tetsia Sasaki, the hardware
design lead for Nintendo Switch 2.
Mario Kart World, launching exclusively
on Nintendo Switch 2. Now, what do you
think this brand new Mario Kart game
will be like?
A brand new entry in the Mario Kart
series is launching exclusively on the
Nintendo Switch 2 system. Welcome to
this vast
world. Cart races are held throughout
various regions that span the globe.
It looks so good, dude. Depending on the
time of day and weather
conditions, will change. Yeah, look at
him. He's he's
he's
[ __ ] has dripped out. Oh my god, look
how many [ __ ] racers there are. Mario
Kart game.
You can go off the racetrack and drive
virtually everywhere in this
world. In the classic Grand Prix, race
through four courses in a bid for first
place. I actually like that they're
physical locations on the map. That's
cool. Sleep at the wheel. You'll also
drive to the next part of the
competition, huh? With 24 drivers in
each race, the most in series history,
the competition is gearing up. They got
roads. Mario Kart World featuring the
interstate system. Knockout
tour. Race non-stop from one corner of
the world to another.
Holy crap.
We're just We're straight up [ __ ]
Forza now. Holy [ __ ] When you hit a
checkpoint, you'll be eliminated.
Can you make it all the way to the
finish line?
Oh, she's just flying.
Why did that render give me like drive
around this vast world in free roam?
There's a free roam. We actually just
Forza now
are so drive wherever your heart takes
you. And we have boats. This is great.
You can also go for scenic drives with
friends and even take photos together at
different locations.
Open world Mario Kart is like a fever a
pipe dream idea. This is crazy that
they're doing
this. A brand new race across the entire
world starts
here. Mario Kart World.
The game launches on the same day as
Nintendo Switch. Look at that. They're
hiding the date. Oh, more details about
this title will be shared in Oh, there's
a direct for it. Okay. World Direct, so
be on the lookout for more information
in the future.
I like they're hiding the date. That's
funny. Mario Kart World launches on the
same day as Nintendo Switch 2.
We'll share more details in the future,
so we hope you're looking forward to it.
Dino Dino Jungle spotted. Yeah, I
thought I noticed that, too.
Next, we'd like to introduce some of the
new features of Nintendo Switch
2. These are the Joycon 2 controllers
for Switch
2. And on the right Joycon 2, we've
added a new C button. Finally, we get to
know what this does. Let's take a look
at some new experiences it
offers. What does it do?
alone.
I'm still ahead of all of you guys. Holy
crap. Nintendo, sync your audio
challenge.
That was me. That was you. So quick.
Wait. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.
No.
N. I'm coming for you. No.
Introducing Game Chat, a new feature for
Nintendo Switch 2. Hey, what's up? It's
just Discord.
Hi, missed you. With this feature,
you'll be able to communicate with
friends and family while playing a game.
That's crazy.
Did he just jump?
While using the game chat feature, your
voice is recognized by a microphone
built into the system. Oh, okay. But
you're still behind me, right? All
right, let's keep going. Okay. It can
pick up your speaking voice clearly,
even from a distance. Look at this. Jump
on here.
All right, let's keep going. Let's make
a left right here. Let's make a When
it's noisy around you, your voice will
still come through, letting you chat
with ease. How did you get hit by a bow?
Okay, nice. Nice. It does look
beautiful.
And you can use this feature in handheld
mode, too, letting you easily chat with
friends and family.
If you open the chat menu, it just
Nintendo Discord. Good job. Good job.
There we go. There we go. It even has
shitty video quality just like the real
thing. Just go on top of that dinosaur.
Really? They can do that. You guys, I
just did it. What are they in Jurassic
Park? Wait, I could see that actually.
Oh, he's trying to eat me. He's trying
to eat me. Okay, I got it. I got it.
[Music]
I mean, they do have a deal with
Universal. They could have Jurassic a
Jurassic Park course. That could happen.
Chat to your heart's content. Yo, why is
Lava playing [ __ ] balloon fight, bro?
What's going on? I know that one. It's
so hard, right? It's tough. Oh, wow. I'm
like in the sky right here. I fell. I'm
falling. I'm falling. I'm falling. Okay,
we got it. Where's it? Kirby, look.
You're a star. That's so cute. Yeah,
he's got base taste.
I'm just looking at all the games
they're playing. So, somebody's like
Donkey Kong Country down there. Guys, I
lost. Like, where' you go
[Music]
or expand another friend's game screen.
You got to get above above that wall
that's to your left. I know. Lava was
chill like that.
This is where I have to do a little The
quality is so peak. Average. No, I mean,
compared to a Discord stream, this is
about normal, honestly. I think I I
think I know where you are. I think I
know where you are. Wait, wait, wait,
wait. Okay, I think we have
Okay. Oh, nice. Let's take a picture
here. Okay. Are you ready? Yeah, they're
not sugar coating. I mean, it is just
how it is. Oh, yo, that's sick. I like
your pose. On the right Joycon 2
controller, there's an additional
button. With the C button, you can pull
up a chat menu.
Oh, dang. Really? Actually, guys, uh, I
got a call coming right now, so uh, I'll
be right back. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Here you
can quickly and easily mute yourself and
more. It's just a mute button
by connecting this camera to the system.
Hey yo
yo.
Hi. How's everyone doing? That's crazy.
Wait, how was your touchdown today? It
was good. It's just Discord. It even has
the [ __ ] green screen filter that
Discord has, bro. It's crazy.
Can you wait for me? Please look forward
to games which use your camera feed like
this.
Okay, that's pretty cute.
Nintendo Nitro. No, this is cute. I like
this. I like this. This is a very
Nintendo thing to do. hang out as if you
were together in the same room. I mean,
I'll still be using alternate means, of
course, but games. This is cute for like
a family or whatever. Chat while playing
your personal favorites.
Look at them all racing Super Mario
World SS yet.
Yo honey be thank
the FPS is so funny it's just like
Discord.
What did you think? In developing Game
Chat, our goal was for you to enjoy
playing online with others more closely,
including family and friends. Almost as
if you're all playing together in the
same place.
The camera you saw in the trailer is the
Nintendo Switch 2 camera.
which will be available on the same day
as Switch 2.
A Nintendo Switch online membership will
be required to use Game
Chat. However, since we'd like as many
people as possible to experience Game
Chat, it will be available without a
membership for a limited time. We hope
you'll try it out.
Additionally, Game Chat supports the
Nintendo Switch parental controls app,
and different settings can be adjusted.
For example, whether parental permission
is always required when a child wants to
use Game Chat to play with their
friends. Yeah. You think Goomba is going
to say a slur, bro? We'd like to
introduce another new experience you can
share with family and friends.
On Nintendo Switch, even if you just
have one game, a Joy-Con controller to a
friend and play together. But on
Nintendo Switch 2, you can play together
locally on multiple systems using just
one game. With Game Share, as shown
here, even games that require multiple
screens can be played if one person owns
a compatible game. With Game Share, you
can temporarily share compatible games
with others. Oh my god, they brought
back DS download play. Wait, this is
great.
That was like an incredible thing to
have.
Game Share also supports online play
with other Switch 2 systems, and you can
use it with friends via Game Chat, which
we showed earlier.
Game Share can only be used with
compatible games. This feature is
planned for several titles, starting
with a free update for Clubhouse Games
51 Worldwide Classics on Nintendo
Switch. Cool. Game Share support is also
planned for select games exclusive to
Nintendo Switch 2, so we hope you'll
look forward to it. Up next,
we'd like to show you the Nintendo
Switch 2 system itself.
All right, finally we actually get to
take a damn look at this thing.
At 7.9 in, Switch 2 has a bigger
built-in screen. Here's how that
compares to Nintendo Switch. The
system's thickness remains the same.
With approximately double the pixels
compared to Switch, you can enjoy games
in greater detail on the 1080p
screen.
Okay. Oh. Oh, yes. It supports higher
frame rates. 120 frames per second.
Thank God we're saved. Play in supported
titles. Oh, sweet
Jesus. Oh,
the LCD screen is more vivid and
supports HDR. Okay, so they're still
using more. They'll probably be an OLED
model in like 2 years, I imagine.
The allnew Joycon 2 controllers connect
magnetically. Strong magnets keep the
controllers firmly attached to the
system. Detach your controller easily by
pressing the release button on the back.
Cool. SL and SR buttons are bigger for
greater comfort and control when playing
with a Joy-Con 2 held
horizontally. The left and right sticks
are now larger. Thank
god that was the whole spotlight. It's
just Oh yeah, they're bigger now. Each
Joycon 2 controller can be used as a
mouse to play with compatible games.
Both the left and right Joycon 2 support
mouse controls.
Okay, hold on a minute. They're like, by
adjusting the audio balance between the
ranges, sounds from the built-in
speakers are clearer and more natural in
handheld and tabletop modes.
Interesting.
So you can
voice. God damn it. [ __ ] There we go.
Okay.
Even if you don't have a surround sound
system, games can be enjoyed with more
immersive threedimensional sound as if
it were coming from all around
you. There we go. My my broadcast was
like offset of like unsync, so I wanted
to refresh it.
Place your Nintendo Switch 2 however you
like with a large, sturdy stand.
You can move it freely like this. This
is cool.
In addition to the USBC port found on
the bottom of the system, there's one on
top as
well. It's handy for connecting a USBC
camera or charging in tabletop mode.
Cinema
Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256 GB of
internal storage. Okay, that's pretty
good. Times that of Nintendo Switch for
storing your game downloads, save data,
and more. 256 is reading data is also
faster.
Use the Nintendo Switch 2 doc to connect
to your TV and enable up to 4K
resolution for compatible games. Hey yo,
HDR is also supported in TV
mode. This thing can output 4K. A built,
by the way, built-in Ethernet there at
the bottom. Notice
that. No more adapter. Switch to dock
has a built-in fan that keeps your
system cool. Oh, the dock actually does
something now.
Oh my god.
On Nintendo Switch 2. See, this is what
everybody thought it would do
originally. As well as compatible
Nintendo Switch games, physical and
digital games are supported.
Nice.
As you just saw, Nintendo Switch 2 isn't
simply an improved Nintendo Switch.
We redesigned Well, I mean, it is from
the ground up and packed in lots of new
gameplay features.
And to help players better understand
the Switch 2 hardware, we're currently
developing this
game. Mr. Kawamoto.
Hello.
My current location is actually inside
the game
itself. This is Nintendo Switch 2
welcome tour. Nintendo Switch 2 land. To
Nintendo Switch
2. I'm standing over
here. Okay, everyone, join me inside the
game.
[Music]
There are a lot of question mark icons
here. Let's examine
them. This sign reads, "Where are the
magnets?" The Joycon 2 controllers
attached to the system with magnets. And
those magnets are inside the
system. The SL and SR buttons on the
Joycon 2 are made of
metal. So that's how they attach to the
system. All right, we're going to switch
to uh Twitch instead of of YouTube.
Controllers have mouse controls. See if
that gets rid of the delay. With the
gyroscopes, you can even do something
like this.
You can adjust the position of the golf
club and aim for the cup by rotating the
Joy-Con. Okay, that seems better.
Yo, mouse golf. Combining the mouse
controls and gyroscopes, things like
this are
possible. There are secrets to discover
even as you're playing mini games and
tech demos. Speaking of Twitch, it's ad
time, baby. Some of the secrets range
from the knife system. Yo, now I can be
that guy on Tik Tok cleaning the grill.
There are plenty.
Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour will
launch as a paid digital game on the
same day as Nintendo Switch. So, please
check it out if you're interested.
Now, I'd like to share some more
information regarding Nintendo Switch 2.
This is the game card for Nintendo
Switch 2 titles.
It's the same shape as Nintendo Switch
game cards. Where's the little bump?
It's now red and it has much faster data
reading speeds.
Next up is additional storage.
Switch 2 will only work with micro SD
Express cards.
Okay, they're a different type of SD
card and will make highspeed data
transfers possible.
Cool.
I wonder what flavor the new cartridges
are. The regular micro SD cards used for
Nintendo Switch will not be compatible.
Oh, that's pretty ballsy of them to drop
regular SD card data from Switch to
Switch 2. You can log into your Nintendo
account to use the system transfer
feature. With this feature, you can
transfer save data, digital games, and
more. We're also releasing a new Pro
Controller. It has a C button which
launches chat. And on the back, there
are new
GL and GR. Oh my [ __ ] god, guys. Come
on. In addition, an audio jack has been
added. We've introduced a few new
features, and after today's
presentation, the official Nintendo
Switch 2 website will go live. There
will also be an Ask the Developer
article on the website. The three of us
will talk about the development of
Nintendo Switch. Looking good so far. We
hope you'll check that out as well.
And now the Nintendo Switch 2 launch
date.
Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June June
5th. All right. I was off with I thought
it was going to be like the last week of
May, so I was a week off. Please wait
just a bit longer.
I knew it was going to be soon though.
Nowintend,
broadly
speaking, on Nintendo Switch 2, you can
play three types of games.
Okay. The first type is Nintendo Switch
2 games. Uhhuh. These games take
advantage of the performance and
features of Switch 2. Three games. The
second type is compatible games that
were released on Nintendo Switch. So,
all of them basically. Nintendo Switch 2
Edition games are the third
type. Some games that were released on
Switch will receive upgraded versions
that offer things like improved visuals,
unique ways to play on Switch 2, and
more.
Now, I'd like to show you the Nintendo
Switch 2 edition of Super Mario Party
Jamberee.
Please take a look. They're going to
[ __ ] right after I go back and play
Xenolade 2, they're going to drop this
[ __ ] aren't they? God damn it. Super
Mario Party Jamberee is getting an
upgrade on Nintendo
Switch. The upgrade expands on the base
game and adds new features, including
mouse controls.
mouse controls,
more expressive rumble
and gameplay that uses a camera
accessory. All of which can be accessed
on Switch 2. See, that guy was Let's
check out new and updated modes.
First up is Mario Party mode. With a
single camera, up to four players can
join the festivities. You'll be able I
can't believe Nintendo pirated Death by
Glamour like that. Blatantly
plagiarized.
Okay, putting a camera on Mario Party is
pretty good. I got to I got to admit
that's a pretty funny thing to do. Up
next, it's Bowser
Live. Bowser will bring you on stage
two. Hit blocks to collect the most
coins.
Guide an RC car with your voice
and compete in other mini games using
full body movement and sound. Finally,
take a ride on the mouse controlled
carnival coaster with the safety bar
lowered and secured. That is not
secured.
Use mouse controls to shoot down enemies
while you feel the bumps and rumbles of
the coaster.
[Music]
When you enter a pipe, a miniame will
begin. There's a bouldering game where
two players each control an arm and one
where you shake a can of spray paint and
quickly tag
objects. Enjoy the thrill of these.
Okay, I'm checking Twitter and yeah, the
the stream just has an audio desync.
It's just it's not me. It is everybody.
That's great.
Rumble. The biggest party yet is getting
even bigger. Super Mario Party Jamberee.
Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. Plus Jamberee
TV. Small Indie. Nintendo Switch. July
24th.
Nintendo Switch 2 players who already
own Super Mario Party Jamberee can
upgrade to Nintendo Switch 2 Edition
plus Jamberee TV by purchasing an
upgrade pack. So, it's just DLC. Got it.
Please look forward to a new Mario Party
experience where you can see each
other's reactions while playing. I mean,
it basically is DLC. I bet you this will
be like a $15 thing. Switch to Edition
games. That makes sense.
Ah, of course. Nintendo Switch 2
editions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath
of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda:
Tears of the Kingdom feature enhanced
resolution. Oh my god, it's 60fps. And
also support HD, which makes the image.
Oh, it's glorious.
With smoother, higher definition
graphics. Oh my god, it looks amazing.
Plus, you can get even more out of your
adventures in Hyrule using Zelda
Notes. This new feature can be accessed
via the Nintendo Switch app on smart
devices. Okay, but is this a free update
or is this cost me money? Exclusive to
the Switch 2 editions of these titles.
They gave No way. It can help guide you
to various locations like shrines and
corals. Oh my [ __ ] god, dude.
Guidance activating.
We got we I could pull up the map on my
phone and it shows up in the game.
That's goofy.
Or you can share your creations using QR
codes and send Wait. Okay, that's really
cool. Actually, their game.
Wait, that's really
cool. Now I can send everybody my stupid
green goblin hover bike.
We hope these features will make your
adventures even more enjoyable.
It's worth it for the frame rate boost
alone. Ah, Kirby and the Forgotten Land,
you'll be able to enjoy. Wait, it's
getting it's getting DLC. Let's go.
Nintendo Switch 2 Edition along with
improved graphics and frame rates. We're
locking in.
This story takes place in the Forgotten
Land after being struck by a powerful
meteor that's causing some mysterious
changes.
We hope you're looking forward to
Kirby's new adventure.
I haven't played the original yet, so I
I guess Prime 4 Beyond the Nintendo
Switch. I knew it would launch
simultaneously.
All right. So, what does this game get?
Oh, it gets mouse controls. You can use
mouse. Oh my god. On Switch, too.
Yo,
you can explore the immersive world in
4K at 60 frames and it plays 4K 60. It
could play at 120 fps. That's it. Retro
Studios, your life is mine. From these
two modes, both of which support HDR
based on your preference, dude. [ __ ] 4K.
I'd be slapping that [ __ ] in 120 fps.
Plus, Pokemon Legends ZA. Oh, and look
at this. It's running at an acceptable
frame rate. You not only receive a
Nintendo Switch version. Miracles have
occurred. Two edition as well.
A Pokemon game running at an acceptable
frame rate. It's unbelievable. I've
never seen anything like it. City with
enhanced resolution and frame rates.
Why the [ __ ] did they show Why did they

performance upgrade. It's not like a new
DLC like [ __ ] uh

this? Nintendo, give me all three
Xenolade games at 60 FPS and my life is
yours.
