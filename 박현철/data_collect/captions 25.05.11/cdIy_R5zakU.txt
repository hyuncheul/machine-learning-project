now let's see hold on let me get let me
let me get out my big boy be right be
right back bro how how we don't have
this bro what what's going on cuz what
what is didn't drop the
price yes so your guess is four
something y'all said like
450 I'm on their site all I see is
like just their trailer all I see is the
trailer I'm about to go on Twitter hold
on let me see I'm about to go on Twitter
all I see is the trailer
oh they really not dropping the price
what
the
what what is going on what is the price
what is the
price okay I'm looking all on their all
on their thing let me see well okay we
know the launch day we know the launch
day is the 5th of June but what is the
price and where are the pre-orders
y' said maybe it's free 99 this is
Nintendo bro stop playing they was about
they made you pay for the tutorial I
know you ain't playing Nintendo is your
arm and a leg 99 that's what it is
that's what the price is your arm and a
leg
99
okay you said that price you said give
it a few months nah the price about to
be500 if they not telling us the price
about to be
$500 bro okay hold
on yes said the PID tutorial was crazy
I'm not going to lie that might might
have been the craziest thing that I've
seen on here because they like tutorial
is they were like oh this is like it's
almost like astrobot but like a
educational one to let you know like the
way around the switch and I'm thinking
that that's like free coming along with
the game they said if you want a virtual
manual tutorial you going to have to pay
for that like huh like I'm not paying
for no tutorial then uh Astro was free
too right I think
so okay we know that the Nintendo switch
2 comes out June
5th I'm looking on Best Buy I'm looking
on Nintendo I'm looking we have no price
bro we have no price how they don't not
not red what yo there's really no price
on here hold on I'm looking for y'all if
y'all are at school I know hold on hold
on hold
on bro and I'm surprised they don't have
any pre-orders yo they don't even have
any pre-orders on no sites yet what is
going on so you said they're showing a
game play tomorrow
what all I want to know is the
price they doing Mario Kart's uh whole
Presentation tomorrow right or was it
can't remember the date but they doing
that um but I want the price where's the
price at I guess we not figuring it out
and said what I play undertale soon oh
yeah fun fact y'all uh cuz somebody like
added me cuz y'all been saying I need to
play undertale for a long time and then
somebody had added me on Twitter and
said that it was like on sale for a
dollar and I went on there and bought
it cuz I want I said o was a sale but
you got me so I got it for like 99 cent
where is the price but uh I'm not here
you want to see I don't see no price bro
there's no price
so so yeah there will be undertale
soon um but y'all said April 9th is the
pre-order where' y'all hear that at
where you hear that yeah where did you
hear that where y hear that at where you
hear that from bro
be careful now don't get
scammed they it should have dropped
today pre-orders should if you're having
this big Nintendo switch 2 reveal it
only makes sense for you to drop the
pre-orders now what are we waiting on
the price and the pre-order it said
later
today you say you'll save up 500 from
Bondo income
tax bro oh Lord I'm just so surprised
they didn't have no pre-order or Price
that's
crazy now said everybody talking about
the price even content creators too cuz
some of y'all be thinking we get this
stuff for free we got to pay for this
too yeah we're not the lucky when I was
when I was uh when the when the
PlayStation 5 and and Xbox uh series X
yeah series X came out and stuff guess
who was up for like eight hours trying
to get these things okay okay like I we
got to get it too like we're not gifted
it like we got to we got to buy it we
got to stand in line for everybody to
crack ass a dawn to get
stuff and you know you know Nintendo
ain't ping nothing out so we got we got
to fight for that like I'm just I'm just
so they handing nothing out
okay so I'm so
[Music]
surprised this is crazy well all I can
say
is save your money okay save it up for
for two months because it's coming in
June you said they busy upgrading to
National Guard level security before
they drop that price T right so you said
what do I rate the direct oh the direct
was great other than them trying to make
you pay for a um for a
tutorial yeah cuz it was cute like I was
like oh that's nice and they said go
ahead a paid game I said get the get the
fudge out of here yeah so I I think
that's cool I think that the transfer
for your games from your physical switch
one to the switch 2 is good cuz you need
a whole new SD Express card because you
can't use the other one so it's not like
I could I could pop out my SD from that
one and put in the other one it's not
going to work so I would have to do it
the other way so I'm glad they did that
I kind of like the camera thing for
people that don't have discords because
now everybody uses it um I barely use it
I only use it because I'm trying to play
with my friends that's the only reason
why I have it um I wouldn't have had it
otherwise um so I think that's good uh I
think the new games they announced on
here are good um I think the backwards
compatibility with the switch one stuff
and plus having different upgrades is
all good
too but
um I really wish they included the
pre-order the price and pre-order isn't
the samee you don't even have to like
say that there's a pre-order just let me
know the price so that people could like
start budgeting if they need to you know
and try to like figure out
what so y'all saying they saying 450 who
are y'all
citing CU ain't nobody saying where
y'all just being like they said this day
they said 450 who is saying what and
where MH cuz I look for official sources
I don't listen to no rumors I don't
listen to no leaks I need the official
announcement okay I don't listen to none
of that the the sources are just trust
me
bro trust me bro.com like that's the
source trust me bro y'all saying Twitter
Twitter's not a reliable source either I
need the official people telling me need
telling me they need to tell me they
they it should have okay pre-order
should have happen we supposed to know
the price right no excuses I don't want
no Source being chat gbt I don't want
the source being you just know I don't
want the source being this person said
it I'm saying is it
official damn um I'm I'm a little upset
because we supposed to see we supposed
they supposed to have the pre-order
already the link in the description
below and and and guess what we supposed
to know the price bro most important
things all right I'm I'm good I'm going
to go back to sleep now he said guess we
just wait let me let me
check he said it's 570 your uncle told
you he said hey nothing I
know hey bro he said how do you know he
I just
know let's see
yeah you see you told your friends they
spoiled the game you're excited for this
direct you cutting them out of your life
oh my God the direct is over
baby you can you can go watch it but
it's
over you said yeah and that's another
thing I'm trying to figure out the
upgrade prices for if you already have
the game cuz they didn't say that either
like if you already have like for
instance I already have Mario party
jamere if I upgrade to the Nintendo
switch 2 Mario Party jamere how much
ises that upgrade because it better not
be another
60 like I like to upgrade a cool 15
would be fine with me like a cool
$15 pushing it at 20 for the upgrade but
a cool 15 is okay for
me pushing it at 20 but it should not be
over $20 I feel like for a upgrade
it should not be more than
20 let me
see man man where is all I know is that
whoever was in charge of this Nintendo
America um yeah um live they getting
fired today they're cooked they getting
fired today they are cooked F that's all
I know that is all I know Nintendo 2
direct was very good but we just don't
know the price it would have been it
would have been a bang out of bang 10
out of 10 if we know the price hold on
let me
see
uhuh okay
um here we go I got I might have some
news
okay so one of the video game
like he's he's he's The Insider for he's
a I would say damn near Dev at this
point almost um he's a Nintendo switch 2
will cost $449 USD when it
launches okay I thought so
so so he said it's
449 cuz everybody's like how much is is
the
price they saying 449 twed
[Music]
$449.99 let me
see bro trust me
bro okay so it's going to
be oh they're saying okay on okay so on
the UK store for
Nintendo it's saying pre-orders start
April 8th April 8th why didn't start
today h so it's starting April 8th
pre-orders and then it says that is for
450 okay so at least we have time at
least we have time cuz highy it kind of
It kind of would have been a little
crazy if they did uh now that I think
about it if they did say that the
pre-orders like were dropping right now
everybody
going you
know hey that's how you supposed to do
CR sight corre height
yeah y'all saying 3.95 in the UK but you
got you guys you got to understand the
price difference with 395 and $450 in US
dollars is that the UK money costs more
yeah don't don't get fooled bro don't be
fooled and thinking oh it's only $395 in
the UK no no no it's 3.95 euros like you
UK money not not us money that's going
to be more yeah bro like 450 is very
doable
yeah yeah different currencies it's not
the
same it's much it's much stronger I mean
it's the same it's just not the same
number visually but it's the same um
it's it's it's much the Nintendo switch
2 is much stronger V like visually and I
think just and all around it could play
I think it could play AAA titles yeah
they said pounds the way not Euros
pounds I thought it was Euros whatever
yeah I don't know they their laws over
there I don't care I'm I'm a blood
American okay I'm a good American all
right
anyway so you say it's going to cost a
lot more money in the UK yeah it is it's
going to cost more over there um I
wonder no I should just get it cuz I was
like cuz we're going to Japan MH we're
going to Japan but that's in October
that's Ms so I was like nah because I
was thinking of getting it in Japan but
I was like never mind we should might as
well just get it now
so never mind um it says makes sense
they giv us six days to self SM and get
our get our funs together look oh my God
they said do what you got to do hey
honey do what you got to do some fo feet
pcks you know know what I'm saying do
what you got to do bro go go on that day
bro he said don't they have special
editions in Japan in Japan it was like
like my switch here right my switch my
switch here that I got here right um I
got it in Japan even though I already
had one I just wanted one in from Japan
and they had customizable like colors
that I could make for my switch so like
the colors that I have here would not be
able for me to get if I was here in
America I would have to buy like two
different like packs in order to get
this combination but over there they let
me choose the combination I want and
then they boxed it up all nice and like
even the things that like go on top of
like this like the little black part
that's usually black that you could put
on this I chose it as a different color
as well made that pink so they have a
lot more uh customizations so I'm
definitely still keeping this switch um
cuz that's a relic for me but this new
one is definitely definitely I wonder if
they have Customs out there we'll find
out when we get there I'm excited but
I'm excited
everybody save your money up and if
you're in
class do your work okay do your homework
