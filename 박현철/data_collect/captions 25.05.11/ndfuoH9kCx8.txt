The Nintendo Switch has been one of the
most popular consoles since its launch.
With a library that's only gotten better
over time. From massive AAA titles to
incredible indie games, the Switch has
something for everyone. If you're
looking to add some must-play games to
your collection, here are the 20 best
games you can play on the Switch right
now. Few games embody the magic of video
games like Super Mario Odyssey. It's a
platformer that isn't just about
reaching the goal. It's about movement,
exploration, and playful discovery.
Every world is packed with secrets,
rewarding curiosity in a way that feels
almost endless. The addition of Cappy
fundamentally changes how you interact
with the game, letting you possess
enemies, objects, and even inanimate
objects like electricity to traverse
levels in completely unexpected ways.
Woohoo!
The pacing is impeccable. Whether you're
solving quick platform challenges or
just running around New Donk City,
everything feels fluid and responsive,
and the variety unreal. One moment
you're bouncing off a T-Rex's back, and
the next you're rolling through the
desert sands of Toast Arena. It's a
masterclass in creativity, effortlessly
mixing nostalgia with new ideas. If you
have a Switch, Super Mario Odyssey isn't
optional, it's essential.
When Metroid Prime first released, it
redefined what a firstp person adventure
could be. Metroid Prime Remaster doesn't
just update it, it perfects it. The
visual overhaul is fantastic. But more
importantly, the controls have been
fine-tuned to feel natural on modern
hardware. Whether you go with dual stick
aiming or the classic lock-on system, it
plays like a dream.
The brilliance of Metroid Prime lies in
its atmosphere. You're alone on Talon 4,
piecing together the planet's history
through environmental storytelling,
scanning ancient ruins, and slowly
growing more powerful as you collect
upgrades. The world unfolds seamlessly
with no intrusive way points, just your
own intuition guiding you forward. It's
eerie, immersive, and timelessly
brilliant. If you've never played
Metroid Prime, this is the best way to
experience it. And if you have, it's
worth another trip.

There's nothing quite like Outer Wilds.
It's a game that respects your
intelligence, throwing you into a
handcrafted solar system and letting you
unravel its mysteries entirely on your
own terms. The premise is simple. You're
an astronaut trapped in a time loop,
reliving the same 22 minutes before the
sun explodes. Every loop is a chance to
learn something new, piece together
ancient secrets, and slowly build an
understanding of what's really going
on. There's no combat, no leveling up,
just raw discovery. You could spend
hours just flying around, deciphering
alien languages or trying to land on a
planet that crumbles beneath your feet.
Every revelation feels personal because
the game never spells things out for
you. It's just you, your ship, and the
vast unknown. It's one of the most
rewarding games you'll ever play and an
absolute must on Switch. Let us know
what you think of this one down in the
comments
below. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the
Kingdom takes everything that made
Breath of the Wild great and cranks it
up to 11. The game expands on the open
world of Hyrule with new mechanics like
building your own vehicles and creating
contraptions to solve puzzles. You play
as Link, who once again has to save
Hyrule from an ancient evil. But this
time, there's even more freedom to
explore. The world is massive, filled
with floating islands, mysterious caves,
and hidden temples. The shrines and
puzzles are as fun as ever, and the new
powers at your disposal open up even
more ways to approach situations.
Whether you're gliding across vast
landscapes or diving into the depths,
Tears of the Kingdom is an exhilarating
adventure full of surprises and moments
of awe.
Revalry, people having a good time.
Well, sure then. In Hades, failure isn't
just an option. It's the point. Every
time you fall, you're rewarded with a
little more story, a little more
context, and maybe even a wink from
Duca. It's a game that makes death feel
meaningful, which is fitting for
something set in the
underworld. The game is a rogike, but
it's not just about the runs. It's about
the story you uncover each time you fail
and try again. Each death brings you
back to the house of Hades, where you
will chat with gods, bond with your
frenemies, and pet Cberus, the best
three-headed boy in all of mythology.
Combat is lightning fast and endlessly
customizable. With a mix of weapons and
blessings from Olympian gods like Zeus,
Athena, and Dian Isis, the boons are
like party favors from your relatives,
except they make you ridiculously
powerful. Want a build where your shield
ricochets like Captain America on
caffeine? Done. Prefer to turn your foes
into walking poison bombs? Easy. The
combat is flawless. The real magic is in
relationships you build as you crawl
your way out of hell, one attempt at a
time. JRPGs have come a long way, but
Octopath Traveler proves that old school
design can still feel fresh. Its HD 2D
art style is gorgeous, blending pixel
art with modern lighting and effects to
create something truly unique. But it's
not just about looks. The game has one
of the most engaging turn-based combat
systems in the genre. Thinking time. The
breakin boost system encourages
strategic play, forcing you to analyze
enemy weaknesses and time your strongest
attacks just right. It's not just about
mindlessly grinding. It's about
precision, planning, and exploiting
every opportunity. And while the eight
character structure might seem
disconnected at first, each protagonist
journey is filled with personal stakes.
From revenge quests to tales of
redemption, it's a love letter to
classic JRPGs, but refined for modern
players. If you ever loved a turn-based
RPG, this is one you can't miss.
Moa Stray is one of those games that
almost feels like a hidden secret, an
overlooked sci-fi platformer with a ton
of heart, eerie atmosphere, and some of
the best puzzle mechanics I've played in
an indie game. And on the Switch, it
feels like it truly found its home. The
game puts you in control of Mo, a small
gelatinous creature that can jump, cling
to walls, and take over the minds of
enemies. At first, it seems like a
simple platformer, but as you progress,
the game reveals layers of storytelling,
environmental puzzles, and action
sequences that feel incredibly
rewarding. And the game storytelling
completely unique rather than spoon
feeding you a plot. Mow astray lets you
uncover what happened through
environmental details, flashbacks, and
the memories of the creatures you
possess. It's a method that rewards
players for paying attention, making the
world feel lived in and mysterious. If
you're looking for something unique,
something that blends platforming,
puzzles, and storytelling in a way that
few games do, Mo is a perfect pickup on
Switch. It's an underrated indie that
deserves way more
attention. Next up, we have the quiet
descent into the unknown that is Hollow
Knight. You're not guided. You're
dropped. Left to figure out the world
and its secrets on your own. The beauty
lies in its restraint. You feel the
loneliness of the hollow nest, the
weight of its history, and the hope
buried beneath the decay. It's the kind
of game that doesn't tell you what to
feel, but lets the silence between notes
of its haunting soundtrack do the
talking. As Tiny Hollow Knight, you'll
explore sprawling caves, ancient cities,
and eerie temples, uncovering the tragic
history of the kingdom and its
insect-like inhabitants. The game's
handdrawn art style is mesmerizing with
every area feeling
distinct. Combat and exploration are
perfectly balanced with just enough
challenge to make every victory feel
hardearned. And let's not forget the
soundtrack. Each note feels like it was
plucked straight from the soul of the
kingdom itself.
When I played Super Mario RPG, I was
expecting a charming old school Mario
adventure. What I wasn't expecting was
how much personality and humor this game
has. It's classic Mario, but with an RPG
twist. Turn-based battles, a
surprisingly deep story, and some of the
wildest and weirdest and most lovable
characters in the entire franchise. The
combat system keeps things engaging with
timed hits, which adds a layer of skill
to the usual turn-based formula, and the
writing absolutely delightful. It's one
of those games where you're constantly
grinning, whether it's from a clever
joke or a nostalgic callback. If you
love RPGs, platformers, or just games
that make you smile, Super Mario RPG is
a mustplay.
The ultimate party game, Super Smash
Bros. Ultimate, is what happens when you
throw every video game character ever
into an arena and let chaos ensue.
Mario, Link, Samos, SephaRoth, Steve
from Minecraft, a potted plant, yes,
really. They're all here and they're all
ready to throw
hands. The beauty of Smash Ultimate is
that it works for everyone. Want a deep
competitive fighter with frame perfect
combos? It's here. Just want to button
mash and throw your friends off the
stage with a giant hammer? Also here
with an enormous roster, endless game
modes, and some of the best multiplayer
fun you can have on the Switch, Smash
Ultimate is a must own. Just be warned,
friendships will be tested, controllers
will be thrown, and there will be that
one person who only plays as Kirby and
spams the downbeat move.
There's a specific kind of joy in
planting seeds, watering them, and
watching them grow into something
beautiful. Stardew Valley isn't just
about farming. It's about reclaiming
something simple and pure in a world
that often feels too fast. It's a game
where nothing is rushed, where
friendship matters, and where even rainy
days feel like a blessing. It's
wholesome escapism at its finest.
Whether it's fishing, farming, or
befriending your grumpy neighbor, the
game is a warm hug that makes every
little achievement feel monumental. Play
it long enough and you'll forget why you
ever wanted to leave the
farm. No tutorials, no handholding.
Super Meat Boy throws you straight into
the fire and dares you to come out
alive. Every level is a gauntlet of
spikes, saws, and split-second
decisions. And when you finally nail it,
the feeling is electric. It's a game
that doesn't care about your comfort. It
cares about your determination. Fun
fact, each level replay shows every
failed attempt simultaneously, turning
your screen into a massacre of past
mistakes. The blood smeared replays of
your attempts, that's just the game
mocking you, and you love it anyway.

When I first played Children of Morta, I
expected a fun pixel art action RPG.
What I didn't expect was a deeply
emotional story about family, loss, and
resilience. This game is like if Diablo
had a heart and also made you want to
call your relatives just to tell them
you appreciate them. Each member of the
Burkson family has their own unique
combat style. Whether it's slashing
through hordes of monsters with a sword
or raining arrows from afar, the rogike
elements keep things fresh. But it's the
narrative that really hits hard. The
game constantly reminds you that while
individual strength is important, it's
the bonds we share that truly make us
powerful. Plus, it plays like an
absolute
dream. By now, Undertale doesn't really
need an introduction. It's an indie
classic. A game that took the gaming
world by storm with its incredible
storytelling, unique combat system, and
unforgettable
characters. But what makes the Switch
version so special? For one, Undertale
is a deeply personal game, and there's
something about playing it in handheld
mode that makes the experience even more
intimate. Sitting with the switch in
your hands, staring into the pixel art
world of the underground, you feel like
you're being directly spoken to. Whether
it's the goofy jokes of Sans and
Papyrus, the eerie encounters with
Flowey, or the deeply emotional moments
that hit unexpectedly hard, it all feels
more personal when the screen is right
in front of you. Personally, playing
Undertale on Switch feels like
revisiting an old friend, but in a way
that felt fresh. The game runs
flawlessly. The portability adds an
extra layer of connection, and whether
you're playing for the first time or
replaying to get a different ending,
it's just as magical. If you haven't
played Undertale yet, the Switch version
is the way to go. And if you have played
it, well, it's always worth the
experience
again. At first glance, Celeste looks
like a simple pixel art platformer, but
anyone who's played it knows it's so
much more than that. It's an emotional
journey wrapped in a brutally precise
challenge. And the Switch might just be
the perfect place to play it. The game
follows Meline as she climbs the
treacherous Celeste Mountain, not just
fighting against the environment, but
also against her own doubts, fears, and
mental struggles. The story is
surprisingly deep with a raw look at
anxiety and self-doubt. But what makes
Celeste so special is how it translates
all of that into gameplay. Every jump,
dash, and wall grab feels tight and
deliberate, which is crucial when you're
navigating levels filled with spikes,
moving platforms, and sections that
require absolute perfection. And let's
talk about that soundtrack. Lena Rain's
music is an absolute masterpiece, mixing
soft piano melodies with intense
electronic beats that evolve as you push
further up the mountain. With headphones
on, the experience is even more
immersive, making it easy to get lost in
the rhythm of the game.
Whether you're up for a challenge or
just in it for the story, this is a
mustplay. If you're looking for an RPG
that'll consume your life, Xenolade
Chronicles 3 has you covered. It's
massive, emotional, and packed with more
lore than a fantasy author's oversted
notebook. The world of Anos is
stunningly vast, filled with massive
landscapes, hidden secrets, and
creatures that range from manageable to
why is that level 90 monster just
casually walking around in my tutorial
area. The combat system blends real-time
action with tactical depth, keeping
every fight engaging, even when you're
just grinding to avoid getting stomped
by said level 90 monster. But what truly
sets Xenolade Chronicles 3 apart is its
story. It's a heartfelt existential tale
of war, identity, and the meaning of
life. Featuring some of the best
character writing in the series, it's a
game that'll make you laugh, cry, and
scream at your screen when the plot
twist hits. An absolute gem for RPG
fans. No way.

Next up, a game for the anime fans.
Persona 5 Royal is the pinnacle of
turnbased RPGs thanks to its intricate
systems and unmatched style.
Gaining levels isn't just about grinding
battles. It's about balancing school
life, friendships, and dungeon crawling.
The confidant system adds depth,
allowing you to form bonds that enhance
your abilities and unlock unique perks.
What makes Persona 5 Royals so special
is how it intertwines mechanics with
narrative. Every decision you make in
and out of combat affects the world
around
you. The game's themes of rebellion and
self-discovery resonate on a personal
level, making every hour spent in its
vibrant world feel meaningful. He's not
alone. Find them and kill them all.
There's a level in Ory in the Will of
the Wisps where you're running for your
life, narrowly dodging collapsing
platforms and relentless enemies. While
the music builds to an emotional
crescendo, then it ends and you just sit
there stunned. That's what this game
does. It overwhelms you with beauty,
challenge, and emotion, then leaves you
speechless. Every frame of this game
looks like it could be a painting hung
in a gallery. The emotional highs and
lows hit harder because you're so
connected to Ary's world. Plus, the
platforming is buttery smooth. This
one's a mustplay for the platformer
fans. Nothing brings people together or
tears them apart quite like Mario Kart 8
Deluxe. It's the perfect mix of skills,
chaos, and sheer luck. could be
dominating the race, perfectly drifting
through every corner until someone
launches a blue shell at you and
suddenly you're at eighth place,
wondering where it all went wrong. The
track selection is incredible, ranging
from old school favorites to creative
new courses. The controls are tight, the
visuals are crisp, and the item system
ensures that no lead is ever
safe. Plus, the DLC keeps adding even
more content, making sure Mario Kart 8
Deluxe never gets old.
Darkness if it returns night. Ever
wanted to play Dark Souls but as a rat
with a sword? Tales of Iron 2: Whiskers
of Winter deliver brutal weighty combat
in a beautifully handdrawn world. The
sequel builds on everything that made
the original great. Tight combat,
challenging boss fights, and an
impressive, grim atmosphere that somehow
makes a game about a rodent feel deeply
emotional.
You play as a warrior rat fighting for
survival against deadly foes. And the
game doesn't hold your hand. Every
battle is a dance of precision dodging,
welltimed parries, and sheer willpower.
It's challenging but fair. And every
victory feels like an earned triumph.
Plus, the narrator's deep, grally voice
makes everything sound 10 times more
epic. The very weapons of legend. If you
love challenging combat, this one is a
no-brainer. Just prepare to die a lot.
The darker the shadow. I went into
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet with cautious
optimism. Openw world Pokémon cool.
Performance issues less cool. But
despite the janky frame rates and
occasional glitches, I had an absolute
blast exploring Palia. The freedom to go
anywhere right from the start is a
breath of fresh air for the series. Want
to challenge gyms in any order? Go for
it. For to hunt down Titan Pokémon
first, that's an option, too. and the
new Pokémon designs. Some of the best
we've had in years. Sure, it's not
perfect, but underneath the technical
hiccups, it's one of the most ambitious
and fun Pokémon experiences to date.
Plus, Corodon and Marodon might be the
best ridable Pokémon
ever. That's it, folks. Let us know your
favorite in the comment section down

I'll see you in the next one.
