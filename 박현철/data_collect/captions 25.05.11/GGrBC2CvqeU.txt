this might work I hello hello hello
hi okay maybe possibly
[Music]
hi it is 6:10
a.m. I'm not going to lie my alarm did
not go off and it it and and and we
missed a little bit uh so I'm very sorry
um thank you thank you thank you for uh
en en enjoying hello hi uh good morning
guys uh so we're going to get right into
it um and just just ASAP and and then
we'll be all good here we go okay cool
awesome thank you a Nintendo switch
online membership will be required to
use game
chat however since we'd like as many
people as possible to missed game chat I
missed a switch to camera we'll go back
Mario Kart World okay we're going to go
back and then we're going to do that
okay additionally game chat supports the
Nintendo switch parental controls app
and different settings can be adjusted
for example whether parental permission
is always required when a child wants to
use game chat to play with their friends
so there's Discord added there's a
camera we like to introduce another new
experience you family and
friends on Nintendo switch even if you
just have one game you can pass a
joy-con controller friend and play
together but on Nintendo switch 2 you
can play together locally on multiple
systems using just one game with game
share as shown here even games that
require multiple screens can be played
if one person owns a compatible game
that's share you can temporarily share
games with others who also have Nintendo
switch too or a Nintendo switch system
wait actually three other systems at a
time oh my
God game share also supports online play
with other switch 2 systems and you can
use it with friends via game chat
Discord thing we're going to go back by
the way can only
this feature for several titles starting
with a free update for Clubhouse games 5
Classics on Nintendo
switch game share support is also
planned for select games exclusive to
Nintendo switch 2 so we hope you'll look
forward to it up
next oh so they did go with the yeah
yeah yeah we'd like to show you the
Nintendo switch 2 system itself
okay please what we're here for
at 7.9 in switch 2 has a bigger built-in
screen here's how that compares to
Nintendo switch the system's thickness
Remains the
Same where is ey delayed with
approximately double
the 80P
screen
okay w W screen supports up to 120
frames per second allowing for smoother
gameplay and supported titles huh we
skipped
60 LCD is crazy HDR is also czy more and
supports HDR providing more contrast
between light and dark
areas I'm hoping it's 120 like on the
actual like TV cuz we have hand 2
controllers connect
magnetically strong magnets keep the
control is firmly attached to the system
detach your controller easily by
pressing the release button on the back
okay the andr buttons are bigger greater
comfort and control yeah I don't know if
you ever tried to play without one of
those like attachments but that was like
[Music]
horrid the left and right sticks are now
larger I swear if this drift I swear I
swear I'm going to actually going to
lose it e joy-con 2 controller can be
used as a mouse to play with compatible
games both the left and right joy-con 2
support Mouse
controls that's awesome by adjusting the
audio balance between the ranges sounds
from the built-in speakers are clearer
and more natural in handheld and
tabletop
modes it has a built-in microphone so
you can voice chat with friends anytime
via game chat just also caning
technology to filter sounds so your
voice will come through clear I
Nintendo's not known for great audio uh
even if don't have a surround sound
system games can be enjoyed with more
immersive threedimensional sound as if
it were coming from all around you
[Music]
place your Nintendo switch 2 however you
like with a large sturdy stand they had
that on the ol you can move it freely
like
this in addition to the USBC Port found
on the bottom of the system there's one
on top as
well it's handy for connecting a the reg
camera or charging in tabletop mode
that's nice that's actually really
really
nice cuzz the it used to be on the
bottom that it's like the same thing as
the Apple Mouse like it didn't make
sense6 GB of internal storage eight
times that of Nintendo switch for
storing your game downloads save data
finally I can have like two games on my
regular switch without a DD card it's
crazy like you get like fire Swit to do
connect to your TV and enable up to 4K
resolution for comptible games hdr
isps on the bottom 60 FPS you see that
4K 60 FPS
crazy okay actually I'm this is actually
so hyp Nintendo switch 2 doc has a
built-in fan that keeps your system cool
this helps keep performance stable okay
so it's an actual that's wow wow okay
this is everything we
wanted on Nintendo switch 2 you can play
Nintendo switch 2 games as well as
compatible Nintendo switch games
physical and digital games
supported like nintend dogs right
right yeah we can play Nintendo dogs in
4k actually
genuinely wait actually I'm getting hyp
for this it's actually
possible why you would do it
we redesigned the system from the ground
up and packed in lots of new gameplay
features and to help players better
understand the switch 2 Hardware we're
currently developing this
game Mr
kaoto hello this is Nintendo H my
current location is actually inside the
game
itself whoa this is Nintendo switch 2
Welcome tour exclusive to Nintendo
switch
2 wa this looks cool okay I'm standing
over
here okay everyone join MEC uh 2D
3D there are a lot of question mark
icons here let's examine them 1 2 3
switch to this sign reads where are the
magnets the joycon 2 controllers attach
to the system with magnets and those
magnets are inside the system okay so
it's just like an in SL and Sr buttons
on the joyon 2 are made of metal
so that's how they ATT system
okay a magnetic circuit is formed
between them so they won't easily
detach honestly yeah if the Nintendo
switch is like these you s of secrets
about Nintendo switch 2 another example
the joycon 2 controllers have Mouse
controls and when combined with the
gyroscopes you can even do something
like
this you can I'm
byting The
Joy it adds to the uh whole Nintendo has
to have something new with the system
things like this
kind there are secrets to even as you're
playing mini games and Tech
demos some of the secrets range from the
unique features of the system to Tiny
details you might not notice until
they're pointed out there are plenty
there are
plenty Nintendo switch 2 Welcome tour
will launch as a a paid digital game on
the same day as Nintendo switch 2 so
please check it out if you're interested
okay the first thing I'm not really much
of a fan of paid game for something like
that no I'm not I'm not paying to get a
tutorial on my yeah
that's for Nintendo switch two
titles it's the same shape comp game
cards but it's now red and it has much
faster data reading speeds okay
nice next up is additional storage
switch 2 will only work with micro SD
Express
cards they're a different type of SD
card and will make high dat possible be
pretty confusing for the average
consumer I think please note that
regular micro SD cards used for Nintendo
switch will not be compatible uh I know
it's because it's like faster
additionally to transfer data from
switch to switch 2 you can log into your
Nintendo account to use the system
transfer
feature can transfer save data digital
games and more that's nice yeah but like
we're also releasing a new Pro
Controller hell yeah it has a c button
which launches game chat and on the back
there are new GL and gr buttons which
you can use to assign existing button
controls like
turbo okay in addition an a yeah there's
like I built in turbo button programable
that's actually really cool new features
today's presentation the official
Nintendo switch 2 website will go live
also be an ask the developer article on
the website where the three of the SD
card thing is going to be like a pretty
big problem I think for the average
consumer but I think it's necessary if
you actually want to have like faster
technology for your actual game so
understandable but
like uh Launches on June
5th we're very much looking forward to
the day when you all get to experience
it so please wait just a bit
longer that's 2 months excuse me
nowly
speaking on Nintendo switch 2 you can
play three types of
games the first type is Nintendo switch
2 games yeah exclusive games for
nintendoage of the performance and
features of switch
2 the second type is compatible games
that were released on Nintendo switch
the kingom links okay Nintendo switch 2
Edition games are the third
type some games that were released on
switch will receive upgraded versions
that offer things like improved visuals
unique ways to play on switch 2 and more
okay okay so it's a it's it's a switch
one game that is basically made
exclusively for the switch 2 it's kind
of confusing but it's an upgraded switch
regular game that's what that
is Super Mario Party jamere is getting
an upgrade on Nintendo okay so this is a
switch 2 edition of Super Mario Party
and features this is a cool way to
revitalize games that are released for
the switch it's just a little weird to
do it with a game that audio
recognition more expressive
Rumble and gameplay that uses a camera
accessory okay all of which can be
accessed on switch
2 let's check out three new I don't know
if anybody's going to be using the caram
first up but I have to with a single
camera up to four players can join the
festivities you'll be able to see each
other's faces as you play so you
can reaction and emotions in real time
oh that's going crazy friends can take
the party
online uh it's not like online camera
right though like it's only friends
allowed aeer team wins Bowser will bring
you on stage to hit blocks to collect
the most
Coins guide an RC car with your voice go
no one's going to say go they're just
going to scream Min the mic full body
movement and sound that's kind of cool
though finally take a ride on the mouse
controlled Carnival coaster with the
safety bar lowered and
secured you're off okay so so the camera
is like connect use Mouse controls to
shoot down enemies while you feel the
bumps and rumbles of the coaster
when you enter a pipe a mini game will
begin there's a b so it's like a an arm
seem to be mini game where you shake a
can of spray paint the you can play with
uh all these different things that's
pretty cool enjoy the thrill of these
intuitive mini gamess how quickly can
you reach the
station from mini games that use a
camera the built-in
microphone Mouse controls and Rumble the
biggest party yet is get getting even
bigger Super Mario Party jamere Nintendo
switch 2 Edition plus jamere TV Launches
on Nintendo switch 2 wait sorry I
thought it was Mario jambur switch
Nintendo switch 2 players who already
own Super Mario Party jamere can upgrade
to Nintendo switch 2 Edition plus jamere
TV by purchasing I'm sorry did I
misunderstand that what the switch 2
Edition or something was the switch 2
Edition is the upgraded version of the
thing and
is now an addon it's like a DLC for
Mario party jamere which is different
from Mario Party jamere
okay Nintendo switch 2 editions of The
Legend of Zelda breath of the Wild and
the Legend of Zelda tears of the
Kingdom feature enhanced resolution and
frame rates we're actually getting 60
FPS and also support
HDR speed more vibrant so you can play
with smoother higher defition graphics
what plus you can get even more out of
your adventures in hyru using Zelda
notes
okay this new feature can be accessed
via the Nintendo Switch app on smart
device we're getting actually 60fps on
both the tears of the kingdom and breath
of the wild Swit editions of these oh my
God that's amazing for example it can
help guide you to various locations like
shrines and cororo you haven't found yet
guidance activating
please turn left at the near it
literally is please turn left at the
nearest tree take the one uh uh take the
one Creations using
codes to create in their game actually
High real GPS that's really cool that
tracks you in game and then you can
actually have like schematics with
autobuild that's really neat
wow time save in speedruns we hope these
features will make your adventures even
more enjoyable you can you can have Auto
built wait I wonder if you can have
pre-saved Auto Builds on your dude
Kirby's eating too K forgotten land
you'll be able to preed Auto additional
story exclusive to the Nintendo switch 2
Edition along with improved Graphics
insane Zelda
update uh no no new content besides that
for the zeldas But like after being
struck by a powerful meteor eating right
now with Kirby theat land
forward to Kirby's new
adventure uh no I don't think the Zelda
update will be free I think it's
probably something new that you have to
buy cuz it was similar to that of Mario
Party J and a Nintendo switch 2
Edition this is a great way to
revitalize your old games that are
currently on the Nintendo switch along
with having switch 2 exclusives for
launch in two months I'm actually like a
huge fan of this you can use Mouse
controls for intuitive gameplay I think
a little confusing to the average
consumer initially and I only say that
because I'm
at0 I guess I was confused full HD at
120 choose from these two modes both of
which support HDR based on your
preference and play Style 10 AP 120fps
all right we got Legend Za this is
probably Legends Za which is scheduled
to launch later this year will not only
receive a Nintendo switch version but a
Nintendo switch 2 Edition as well okay
by taking advantage of the power of
switch 2 you can enjoy your adventure in
lumio city with enhanced resolution and
frame
rates okay so this is better than what
they were showing in the trailers cuz
they didn't want to leak it that was a
higher frame rate okay will be available
as both physical and digital
versions dude imagine doing like oh I
have idea you already own the Nintendo
switch version of a game you can play
the Nintendo switch 2 Edition by
purchasing an upgrade pack yeah I wonder
if you could do blindfold run with the
Zelda GPS
gam chat we're doing that by the way I'd
like to introduce a brand new game we're
doing a blindfold run of breath of the
wild but like only with the GPS I know
I've already beaten tears of the Kingdom
blindfolded but like
still i' be just really
funny okay so we didn't get a price for
that but we can't buy the upgraded pack
for the Nintendo switch too this is
going to be really cool you have audio
sliders what whoa wait what
okay this is
cool
kobby dragon Drive oh hell
yeah what a cool way to do the uh the
the mouse as well like how to do it cuz
you're you're actively like rolling like
that that's cool love the representation

with like a button or
something it seems

noisy around you your voice will still
come through
clearly how did you get hit by a
boat okay nice nice it does look

like in the sky right here I I always
love
that
huh I'm sorry Nintendo what did you
do they privated their video
what oh they're probably they're
probably fixing the audio they're
probably fixing the audio right
now
well I didn't think we go back to the UK
version guys we go back to the UK

[Laughter]
the that wall That's to your left yo
shout out to the British if she gets

sure here you canly and easily and more
that's it and there's this I just yeah
the Nintendo dude also connect this
camera to the console Nintendo switch 2
camera
that's okay with an auto green screen
interesting no okay hi how's every it's
just Discord this is just Discord you
can appear on screen and video chat

between
families all together anytime
anywhere game chat game chat yeah
exclusively over game
chat Chad I can't I can't wait to like
you know like I can't wait to be like
hey guys I can't wait to be
like I like game CH I no I I'm taking
the
kids no I don't love you
anymore new star in Mario
Party he's going
left yeah nice cool
accessory I think like as much as I'm
meing on it I think it's cool that they
are
doing because you don't because you know
you don't want to rely on a third party
program
in order for you to communicate and
everything you want an all first party
they're taking the Apple approach I
think pretty
um um I think it's like similar to uh
twitch and YouTube where YouTube's
building out the things all by
themselves twitch is like hey you want a
VOD uh VOD system on Twitch no just use
YouTube like YouTube's doing the best uh
the great thing I think twitch is not so
I like whatt
doing I caught up all right so I entered
in around here okay I did not miss much
it was just the announcement of that all
right hell yeah so I missed I missed uh
when I I did it I just missed the Mario
World uh and Al like Mario Kart World
and then also just like the switch
camera and microphone that's pretty good
okay cool um shout outs to uh uh all
that that's great all right so uh let's
watch enter the gungeon 2 because uh
that was missed during the actual thing
here
um let's see
uh and then also um nailed it uh okay so
it's confirmed by the way that the
Nintendo switch 2 will be
$450
us uh by the way which is pricier uh
than that of the switch at the $300
price point except um I'm not mad about
it uh 450 is a uh a huge price uh
increase from 300 um but with uh
inflation uh plus the fact that uh we're
getting 4K
120 um uh this might be coming from a
place uh a place of uh privilege and
stuff uh being able to do this um just
like as a heads up so I'm a little bit
bied on that um but it seems like that's
it seems a little it seems reasonable um
considering that it has been like seven
eight years since the switch is come out
um if you compare it to like let's say
the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox series
SX
box uh project Scarlet I don't know what
that one's called nobody does um it's
insane so yeah um it seems expensive for
the average consumer just in general um
considering that wages are lower but
then prices are higher for things uh but
taking to inflation plus the actual
increase of quality of a bunch of things
it seems like it might be fair so I'm
actually not mad about that one all
right so we missed enter the gun we
missed
this uh oh games will be uh
$80 we still okay what the [ __ ] okay uh
games will be $80 each looks like uh
what it was um $80 on uh for Mario Kart
World $80 is a price increase for
General AAA games it looks like
um it's it's it's a lot you know $80 is
getting crazy um it's a similar thing to
a Nintendo switch
2 uh where games have been $60 for years
now um so the increase isn't out of this
world uh or like unexpected um it is
expected to go up with everything else
the unfortunate part about that though
is once
again wages aren't increasing but prices
are so $80 is a lot comparatively to
what $60 is relative to you know average
income so uh that's unfortunate but yeah
uh so it it's it's a lot more
money uh yeah just heads
up hi I'm the
enter the gun that dude this is going to
be sick this is going to be
sick here's the first look enter Theon
I've never played enter the gungeon I
watched a ton of it though Dodge
countless bullets and aim for the
gungeon's deps in our Rog likee shooter
sequel now reloaded in a new this looks
insane you can expect some fan favorite
elements to return we're still working
on the game and we're excited to share
more with you in the future
what is
[Music]
[Music]
this there's so many players in this
game oh my
God guys it's outer Wilds 2o

Adam badowski from SRE thread we are
delighted to bring the immersive W of
the dark future to Nintendo players for
