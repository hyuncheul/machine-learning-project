Hey everyone. Today we're going to be
checking out Quarantine Zone: The Last
Check. This is a brand new game that's
coming out in quarter 2 of
2025. Um, the developers of the game
sent me a code to check out the the demo
for the game. I'm not too sure when that
the demo is going to be released, but
you can actually request access to the
play test right now on the Steam page if
you want. But yeah, this game it's very
similar to games that we usually play
like data checking games like uh
Contraband Police and that's not my
neighbor. But in this game, you play as
uh somebody that works at a border and
you're looking for people that are
infected with a zombie virus. So, you're
inspecting survivors and I guess if
they're infected, you have to quarantine
them or dispatch them or I'm not sure
what you have to do,
but very interesting take on a
border patrol type game. But yeah, I
thought it looks really cool. So, I
thought I'd check it out for you guys
today. And uh yeah, let's just check it
out. Quarantine Zone.
Ah, finally awake, commander. Thought
you were dreaming of a vacation on some
sunny beach. Not the best fantasy these
days,
huh? Anyway, welcome back to reality.
We're almost there. Checkpoint Alpha.
They've been holding out, but they need
reinforcements. That means
us. All right, get ready. You're
dropping in 20. And commander, watch
your step out there. It's not just the
dead you got to worry about.
Dropped in in a from a helicopter.
You are all aware of this situation. The
city is overrun by a zombie virus. It's
nicer than a contraband. Everyone has
turned into a zombie and we need to try
to save them.
But at the same time, make sure the
infected don't get into the zone. That's
your job. Let's hurry to the checkpoint
and start examining the survivors. You
want us to go over
here? Let's hurry up to the checkpoint
and start examining survivors.
Right. Let's do this.
Just shout next and the soldiers will
let the survivor in. Next.
The first survivor approach. Buddy, why
is your Take a close look. Head so red.
Are there any symptoms that immediately
catch your eye? Of course there are.
Just look at how red his head is. Yeah,
you absolutely must record this symptom
on the symptom
map. Okay, buddy's got a red head.
Are all the known symptoms that
probability of infection? Mark the
detected symptoms to decide where to
allocate the
survivor. Be careful. There may be
multiple symptoms. Survivors may try to
hide them, but later you will have tools
to detect them more easily. All right.
So, he's got red skin
to assign the survivor further. Use the
distribution map.
Okay.
After you have identified and marked all
the symptoms, you must decide on the
survivor's location.
There we go. Subject only shows one
symptom, but it's unclear. Send him to
quarantine so we can monitor him for a
while. All right, buddy. You're going to
quarantine symptoms. Don't do this. Mark
them and classify them. And good luck.
Next. Next person. All right. Next.
How you doing, sir? Out there. Look, no
bites. Why? He's got red hair. Send him
to the
quarantine for
liquidation. Wait, hold up. We'll take a
look at
him. Um, symptoms. What nice is I like
that there's like a little picture right
here so you don't have to keep going
back and
forth. Let's take a look at your eyes,
buddy. They look good. The red skin. The
red hair
though. Green
skin.
Herpes. What? Do you got herpes? No.
Take a look behind
you. He's got some like something's up
with the skin on the back of his neck.
What is
that?
Freckles. Bruises. Yeah, he's got
bruises.
Red bruises. I don't know. Discharge. No
discharge. Nose
puss. It's weird that your your mustache
has like little red hairs on
it. I guess I can't I can't determine
the his temperature because I don't have
that tool
yet. Sneezing. Virus breath. What the
hell is virus? Virus breath.
Oh,
like
that. All right. So, I guess we only
have just the
bruises. Um, inspection. I'm going to
have to send you to quarantine, buddy.
I'm not sick. I swear he's got bruises
on his neck next.
How you doing, ma'am? You can trust me.
What is up with your skin on your
face? Take a look.
Skin cuts. There we go. That's the
symptoms. Possible sign of infection.
Your eyes are good, so that's fine. I'm
going to send you to quarantine. Wait.
Have a good day, lady. I'm fine.
Have a good day. That's it for today.
Hit the bunks. We've got another long
day tomorrow. That wasn't too
bad. Supposed to be a tutorial, though.
So, I wonder if uh we'll find out if we
get them
incorrect. They had some symptoms, so I
guess sending them to quarantine was a
good idea. Let's get some
sleep.
750 quarantine maintenance, too. Wait,
so I I lose money if I send them to
quarantine? Does that mean I I it's
easier just to eliminate them if I just
It's cheaper to eliminate.
Jeez. Guess we'll have to decide that in
the future. Check out everyone in
quarantine. All right, we might have to
eliminate some of these
people. Let's take a
look. Quarantine. Re-examine the
survivors you sent to quarantine. Those
whose symptoms have disappeared can be
sent to the block. A survivor is
infected and you leave them in a
quarantine for two days, they will turn
into a zombie and kill everybody in the
cell. Cleansing kills everyone in
quarantine.
He's still alive.
Go over to him and call him in for a
rech.
All right. She looks Yeah, she looks
worse. Look at her skin. These
two skin kind of darkened a little bit.
Let me talk to her though. I'm forever
in your debt. I don't have any symptoms.
Yeah, right here, guys. So, he can be
moved to the block.
No, she she for sure has some symptoms.
What are you talking
about? She's got the red eyes.
Her skin is normal. Wait, not not
red. She's got
some. I don't even know what that is.
Oh, that's like Okay, now that I I'm
closer, I can see it. That's a
necrosis. All
right. I'm sorry,
lady. We're sending you to uh
liquidation.
help you spot symptoms faster.
Grab the scanner.
Grab the
scanner. So, we're sending over to
liquidation. Buddy, is Buddy going to go
finish her off? Let's
see. Oh,
yeah. She did. They did. God
damn. Guess we didn't tell her that we
were liquidating her.
All right, I'm going to take the
scanner. Breakthrough technology for
human inspection that shines through
tissue like clothdif.
All right,
buddy. I'm going to have to scan you,
buddy. Use the scanner to detect
external symptoms under
clothing. Have to detect hidden symptoms
that are not visible by the naked eye.
All right. Now, call in the next one and
use the new tool on him. Yeah. Hold
on. I got to have to scan this
guy. Not seeing anything on him. All
right. So, I think he's good. I'm pretty
sure he's
good. Uh, survivor block red
skin. Yeah, he's he's all clear.
You serious? Another guy. He's grow his
hair, guys. Look, he's got grown even
more red
hair. A little
concerning. Nice abs, buddy. Besides the
red hair, I think he's good. I did say
something about the bruising, but yeah,
it's gone
away. A little concerned about the
growth, the hair growth,
but yeah, get out of here.
Identification.
All right. Next.
I feel okay. I promise. How you doing,
sir? I'm going to have to be the judge
of that. You scan
you.
Um, anything on the UV?
Oh, got to check behind
you.
Oh, here we go,
guys. What is that? Those are skin
scratches or skin
cuts. So, we are going to have
to quarantine him. Plus, he's got some
bruising on his face and bruises.
quarantine. I was healthy yesterday.
Just check again. Next.
How you doing, sir?
Okay. He's got some bruising.
Oh, his eyes, guys. Look.
His eyes are a little red, too.
Um, nothing behind him to hold up. So,
he's
got
injectivitis plus some some
bruising, quarantine them. This has to
be a mistake. Next.
I don't have any nice outfit, buddy.
What kind of hat is that? Oh, it's like
a army army hat. So, he's got some
discharge from his mouth. I can I can
tell right away it's mouth
blood.
Um, anything else? Some bruising on his
[Music]
shoulder, on his back, too. Let's say
that's like red bruising, but it's hard
to tell. Take off your hat, please,
sir.
Good.
Um, you can check the the shoes, too. I
didn't even know
that. Just
bruises. So, he's got
two of the symptoms. Three of the
symptoms.
We know too. Quarantine them. Wait, why?
Everybody's been quarantined so far.
Next. Ma'am, how are you doing, ma'am?
You have to believe me. I will believe
you.
Oh,
guys, you liar. You got to
bite. That's really bad.
Anything else? Anything
else?
No. Oh, she's got bruising on her back
and neck. Ne
necrosis.
Necrosis.
Bruises.
Bam. That's bad.
Going to have to liquidate you. I'm
sorry, ma'am. And wait for your turn.
Prepare your belongings. Liquidation.
Hey, just go over there. You'll be fine.
You'll be
fine. Do they kill her right right
away? I don't
know. Yeah, they do. That's It's
brutal. All right, so we're done with
the checkpoints today. Killing an
infected plus 900
bucks. Here we go, guys.
Let's get some
sleep. But we do make a lot of money.
Valid eliminations. Successful block
assignment. All right. Everyone, you've
checked. Open the base management screen
to check the status of survivor. And
until the evacuation happens, you need
to keep an eye on them.
Make sure there's enough food in space.
Enough food in space. Let's focus on the
base today.
Here you can track numbers of survivors,
their condition, quantity of the of
required and available resources per
day, the status, and the level of
current buildings. Nice. So, it's just
like police where you can buy and
upgrade buildings. Well, in this game,
it's
tents. Number of places in all tents.
Number of survivors at the
base. Okay. Generators amount of
buildings in the
block.
Goose
one generators supply energy to your
buildings to produce one unit of energy.
A generator requires one full one unit
of fuel. Fuel must be brought from the
warehouse if there are more buildings
than generator can supply energy for.
Only those buildings that have
sufficient energy will operate. As you
can see, there's no food or fuel for
today. They need to be brought in from
the
warehouse. But first, you have to buy
these
resources. Restock the
warehouse. Buy supplies and fuel for
everyone in the block. $290 for all
this. It's not bad. It's not too bad.
Now that the warehouse is loaded with
supplies and fuel, you need to deliver
them to the block. Head over to the
warehouse.
Oh, I got to do it by by
hand. Here you go. Load the supplies and
fuel onto the cart.
Take the required resources from the
shelf and
pressing.
Okay. Make sure they're stacked
good. Wait, how many do I should I grab?
Should I just grab all of
it? A lot of jerry cans.
Now deliver supplies. Send fuel to the
block.
This thing's like, this thing drifts
like
crazy. The supplies need to go to the
dining hall and the fuel to the
generator. All right, that's kind of
cool. You have to do it. There's these
specific
places. All right.
Let's go
to Where's the medical supplies first?
Small
barracks.
Oh, there you
go. Some fresh food for
you. There you go.
some some
fuel. Wonder if we can like hire people
to do this for
us. Eventually, we'll hire I'll have
some people that we
can we'll restock and refuel everything.
Well, I don't mind doing it,
but probably get to the point where
I'm doing it every day and I get it kind
of annoying or just tedious.
Excellent. Everyone's fat today. Go get
some sleep. We're not checking any new
survivors today. Oh, damn. There are
reports of large zombie clusters in
nearby areas, so we need to be ready.
Zombie
clusters. We going to work the the
towers. Start shooting some zombies from
the
tower.
Go. I'll leave that there. I didn't need
to grab it.
Where you go? Yeah. Look. Bomb bite. Air
strike. To protect the base from zombie
clusters, you need to take control of a
combat drone. That's sick. Space is up.
Shift is
down. Bomb bite and air
strike. I don't have any of these
upgraded.
That's
awesome. They explode like crazy. Like
instantly
explode. It's a lot of them. Jeez.
Hell, he's trying to juke me. You see
that? Just
zigzagging. I got this.
Easy. Hey, we got it. According to our
data, survivors have developed new
breathing related symptoms. To check
them, use this
stethoscope. Pick it up from the table.
Stethoscope instrument for listening to
and analyzing. There we go.
Use a stethoscope to determine infected
breathing. The amplitude of the
breathing waves significantly higher.
Also in indirect sign of infected
breathing may be
coughing. All right. All right.
Next. How you doing, sir? Please just
check. You'll see I'm fine. Looks like
you got some mouth blood. I'm going to
have to check your breathing.
Yeah, he's coughing too,
guys. So, um, he's got a
cough. It's Wood's virus
breath. I got to check again.
Yeah, I think
that's Yeah, that's definitely a sick
breath. Um, he's also
got mouth
blood. I have to scan him
now. No bruising at least.
I think he's good besides
that. It's a pretty slick
outfit. All right, sir. I'm
sorry. I'm going to have
to needs cleaning. What the
hell? Oh, identification verified.
Quarantine status unstable. Incident
detected. What the
hell? Who did this? That wasn't
me. We have to clear
this. Just light them all. Light them
up. Light them
up. Yeah, just set them on fire. All
right, sir.
I'm going to have to send you the
quarantine. I'm pretty sick, so I don't
have high hopes for you.
Next.
Are you sure? What are you Why are you
wearing
sandals? It's raining out. Something
wrong with you. To check your breathing.
Okay, definitely have some
um sick breath and I think he's coughing
as
well. I'm going to have to scan you as
well.
Um can't believe you're wearing flip
flops. Oh, here we go.
He's got
some skin cuts on his
back. Anything up with his eyes?
No. Bruising on his neck? No, he's
good. All right. So, he's got skin cuts
on his back as well. So, I'm going to
have to send him to quarantine. I have
kids in there, please.
Next.
What you doing, ma'am? Why is everybody
wearing flip flops? I'm not a zombie.
I'll be the judge of
that. All right, I think that's
good. What's a healthy breath, though?
Yeah, she's I don't hear any like
bubbles, so she's good for
uh breathing. Got to check rest of her
symptoms
out.
Um I think she's good actually, guys.
Yeah,
guys, take off your glasses,
ma'am. Her eyes are good,
guys. I don't see any bites. She is
healthy
breathing.
Um, yeah, you're good. You're the first
person I'm going to send to survivor
block. Have a good day,
ma'am. Next. Take me away.
How you doing,
sir? All right. That's That's a healthy
breathing. You got some What's up with
your face? Take your glasses off. I
think that's like Are those freckles?
Yeah, he's got freckies. They're called
freckies. But I think that's
good. That's all right. That's not a
symptom of zombie
zombieism. This is though skin
cuts. Got some skin
cuts on his back,
too. I think you're good. Or I got to
quarantine you, sir.
I was healthy yesterday. Just check
again.
There we
go. We're good. Let's get some
rest. Maybe I should buy some of this.
You guys, everyone gonna eat
tonight? I think we're good on food.
Wait, might I have to bring
this? Just make sure everybody can eat.
Wonder if I just leave it here, it'll
teleport back to the storage
area.
Oh. All right. Now, let's get some
sleep.
Today is the evacuation day, and you'll
get a reward for the first batch of
survivors.
Survivors have developed new symptoms
related to their poles and temperature.
To check them, use the thermal
pulseometer. There we go. Pick it up
from the table. New
one. Use a thermal pulseometer to
determine the pulse temperature reading.
An indirect sign of a high pulse may be
hiccups and of high temperature
sneezing.
That's going to be interesting. has some
luggage. We allowed them to bring their
own stuff. But now you need to carefully
inspect the luggage for weapons or
horse. Zombie body parts.
Zombie body parts. Identification
verified. Quarantine status stable. No
incidents reported.
Okay. All right. We'll do the these
first.
Um, he's still
sick. Let's check his thump, his
pulse. It's good. I think he's still
sick,
guys. Um, so that means that I got
to I got to send him to
liquidation. You're sick, buddy. Another
checkpoint. Yeah, it's just another
checkpoint, buddy. You'll be all right.
Just go to the room over there, sir.
Finally, I'm safe. I don't have any
symptoms. See,
I'll be the judge. Survivor sent for
liquidation. Oh, what? He was
uninfected.
Minus300. I thought if he wasn't better
in a couple days, maybe I should leave
these guys
here. Damn it. I just lost 1,300
bucks. I think he's good now, too.
Yeah,
buddy. Survivor block.
This guy is sick.
Okay, so he's got blood still.
Yeah. Necrosis. Necrosis, guys.
necrosis. Yeah, he's done for. I'm
sorry,
sir. Go
to liquidation. You guys seem nervous.
Is everything okay? You'll be all right,
sir. You'll be all right. Just go to the
the room over there. There's
puppies and candy in
there. All right. Next.
How you doing, sir?
What are you doing? I have to check your
bag.
First, I'm going to check your
temperature. Normal. Normal. Take off
those glasses,
[Music]
sir.
Um, got a healthy breathing to scan
you. Um, no scratches.
on your
back. You're
good. All right. You have to check your
luggage
now. Some survivors may
have have baggage with them. Inspect it.
Especially if you hear signals from the
metal detector
frame. You see or ordinary items in the
baggage that the survivor can be let go.
Do not confiscate personal items.
Penalty will follow. If you see weapons
in the baggage, it is contraband and
must be confiscated. You'll be rewarded.
After confiscation, the survivor can be
let
go. Don't forget to illuminate items
with the UV flashlight. You may they may
show signs of infection. In that case,
the survivor must be eliminated. Jeez.
Elimination is also mand mandatory if a
survivor attempts to smuggle parts of
zombie bodies. They are intended to be
used as biological weapons, but any
contact with them results in 100%
infection. Oops. All right, let's
see. All right. Well, he's got some body
parts in
here. Let me
see. Confiscate. Confiscate. No, it's
good. We're going to confiscate the
[Music]
golden bat. That's my father's watch.
Confiscate. We close
this. And
sir, I got to send you to liquidation.
You're scaring me. He's trying to bring
in some infected
parts. See if we were correct about
that. Survivor send for
liquidation. Killing an infected. Yeah,
here we go.
Come on.
Next. M. How are you doing? Put your
luggage there. Please. I have children.
They're waiting for me. So, your pulse
and temperature is
elevated. 155.
So, that's
elevated pulse. And then what's the
temperature?
For inspection. Remove your outer
clothing, hats, glasses, and gloves.
Temperature is
40.2. So that's the highest. So just
below what is considered high
temperature. Still alarming though.
She's she's
coughing. Have to do
the stethoscope.
All
right. Uh, she is coughing, but that's a
healthy well, not
infected breathing or sick breath. It's
not sick breath, so it's
fine. Now, I'm going to have to scan
her, see if she has any bite
marks. Oh.
Nothing.
Nothing on her
back.
Nope. We have to check her baggage
now. She's got some
apples. Those are fine if they're not
infected. So, let's
see. It's hard to tell. I guess it'll
it'll let us know.
So that's fine, but I'm I am going to
have to put her in
quarantine. Inspection
quarantine. Have a good day, ma'am.
I was healthy yesterday. Just check
again.
How you doing, sir? I feel okay. I
promise. Let me be the judge of that
high temperature, guys. 235
237. Well, no, that's the high
pulse. It's high
pulse and high temperature, too.
Look. So, that's both of these. So,
we're going to have to send them to
liquidation. I still haven't seen
anything with the the UV light,
guys. He's definitely has mouth mouth
blood. Yeah, we're just going to send
him to liquidation. Sorry, sir. So,
where am I going now? Hey, don't worry.
There's uh you'll be fine, buddy. Next.
How you doing,
ma'am? Let's scan you and make sure you
have any don't have any bite
marks.
Nothing
good. Red
hair.
[Music]
temperature
normal. You got to watch out too cuz
sneezing and and coughing does affect
the temperature a little bit. You got to
make sure you do like
a a medium pulse in temperature. I just
realized I forgot to check the breathing
on that
guy. She's
good. Hey, you're all good, ma'am.
the survivor
block. There we
go. I can't believe I killed that one
dude. That was my fault,
guys. Yeah, we found this earlier. Said
this morning, today's
evacuation. Head to the block to assign
survivors for evacuation.
But now we can send people
to to
evacuate. Distribute the survivors from
the block by trucks according to the
rules of sorting. Confirmation sends the
survivor to the truck without
possibility return if you finish the
evacuation.
Right. All right. Patrick
Davis. We got a couple of
them. She was good.
Uh, how do we do
this? Red
skin. She was 100%
good. Wait,
what? This guy had skin
cuts. She was good, too.
[Music]
Um,
bruises, red
skin. Very good,
buddy. It's between these two. He just
had
bruises. What? He had skin cuts and
freckies. I'm going to I'm going to say
bruises is fine is
better. So, I guess we're finished. We
can't we can only send four at a time.
So, buddy's going to have to wait.
Sorry,
buddy. Upgrades. Use upgrades to improve
your inspection and
defense. There we go. M 100 102
soldiers 750.
This might be really
good. I'll upgrade
that. Get some of that,
too. Wonder how crazy it
gets.
Generators, small
tents,
clinic. I maybe I should buy clinic,
1300.
Yeah, look, if people are
sick, send them there and then they'll
get better, I
guess. Hold up. Do we have enough? Five
out of five. So, I got to buy another
generator. There we
go. Towers. What are towers
for? Jeez, I'm spending all my money.
So, right now we
have all the the small tents are being
powered. The dining room is being
powered. So, I need
to put more fuel here or to
get
clinic. What's that blue stuff? Why Why
does it do
that? I might be getting ahead of myself
here, guys. Maybe I should just go to
bed. Let's just go to bed. See what
happens
[Music]
tomorrow. Oh, we got
another. Oh, we're watching them,
guys.
Jeez, they're fast.
Got to make sure that they don't get
overrun. And we got to make sure we're
not to shoot our own guys,
too. Oh, did we lose a truck?
[Music]
It's a pretty cool mini
game. I bet it gets pretty crazy. Oh,
it's repairing.
I do wish there was a little bit more
weight to it. There we
go. Feels very arcadey. New symptoms
have appeared and one of them is
aggression. So they might attack you.
Grab the pistol from the table. Also
pick up the analyzer. Our scientists
built it and it accurately detects
infection,
but it's very expensive and there aren't
many, so use it. Personal weapon for
self-defense. Ell now start the
inspection.
We worry about these people.
Identification verified. Quarantine
status stable. No incidents reported.
Her skin's changed color, guys. Look.
How you doing, M? I was helping others
out there. Look, no bites. Yeah, look.
She's gotten worse from yesterday.
She's gotten worse.
[Music]
Um her
eyes. Yeah, her eyes
conjectivitis and she's got mouth blood.
Her
skin has turned green. So for 100% she's
infected. Guys, we're going to have to
liquidate
her. Are they in
here? All right. I'm sorry,
ma'am. Liquidation,
you're scaring me. You'll be all right,
ma'am. Going.
You'll be all
right. All right. Next.
Pink jeans, buddy. And see, and flip
flops. What's all right? Something
something up with you. Normal pulse
temperature is
good. Just you got some something up
with your skin. I think that's
bruising. It's
good. Yeah.
Look. Is
that It's bruising.
I think it's necrosis,
right? I don't know why you have pink
jeans with flip flops in
winter. Something wrong with you.
Stethoscope. I'm going to test this cuz
I'm not sure. Stay calm and wait for
your turn. The subject is infected and
must be eliminated. Okay, there we go.
That must be necrosis then around his
neck. Yeah, just doesn't look like how I
I I've seen it
before. Sorry,
sir. Liquidation. I'm still fine. Right.
Right.
Next. me away.
All right.
Put your back back there. Have to take
your temperature.
M 114 and
36. It's
good.
Stethoscope is
good. Scan. No
bites,
bruising. It's
good. She might be good, guys. This
might be a legit
survivor. All right. What's in your
bag?
Okay. You got a giant truck here. I'm
going to confiscate
that. And you got a V. Yeah. Look, guys.
A gun.
But it's also
infected. Same with the
wrench. All right, I'm going to have to
send you for liquidation.
Is this another Everything was good, but
but that guys
warning massive zombie attack. Here we
go. Is she attacking?
I got her.
I got her.
What are you doing? She just died right
there.

little paranoid here.
Maybe I'll give him this.
The subject is not infected. All right.
That cost me I don't even know how much
money that cost me, but you're good,

breath.
Yeah. Liquidation.
Am I next? I thought I was safe.
Whoa, buddy. I was bitten by by a dog.
Not not a zombie. What the hell? Oh, why
are you so
pale? All right, I don't have high hopes
for this guy. Got some food in here,
too. Coffee, a baguette, and some
cheese. Okay, right off the bat, his
skin
is hella
white. Um, pale
skin. I think I heard him
hiccup as
well. Yeah, there it is. What's your
temperature, sir? It's
elevated. His eyes are red, too,
guys. Not looking good.
Pulse.
Um, elevated
pulse. Got the hiccups already. And
then red eyes. Yeah, this guy's for sure
infected.
Just double check everything
else. His breathing is
fine. See if he has any bite marks.
Let's double just make
sure. Could be it could be just like

Yeah. Liquidation. Is this another
checkpoint?
Next. Warning. Massive zombie attack
again. I got him. I feel okay. I
promise.
Oh, no.
No, guys.
Guys, I did not mean to do
that. Was she infected? I think she was
infected. Anyways,
guys. All
right. Well, we're
good. Let's get some
sleep. There's not enough food in the
block. Oh, yeah. Here we go.
We got you
guys. You know what? We might as
well. Well, we'll get I got the extra
generator. I'll
do the
food. There we
go.
Here we go. Hey, look. There's two of
them
now. Energy reserves. Yeah.
That's five and five. So now I can buy
the
clinic. Can I send Buddy to the clinic
now? the one that I have in the
quarantine or do I need to hire a
doctor. Here's the
clinic. Med kits. I have to go get some
med
kits. If I knew I was going to do that,
I should have bought should have brought
some. I actually really like this like
the simulation part of this. Like having
to refuel
and feed everybody, make sure
everybody's
okay. Forces you to take care of people.
Any attempt to leave the zone without
authorization will result in immediate
consequences.
There we
go. Energy consumption four. So it uses
Yeah. Decent
amount. How much does a tower
use? Is it a
thousand? Oh crap.
We're going have to buy another one of
these.
Um, damn it. I got to go
back. But you can go faster if you hold
shift. There's no stamina,
too. I guess I could have upgraded the
generators that we do have.
I should have told us too how much
energy tower was going to
use. I didn't I had no idea unless I
didn't didn't read
it. Right.
Oh, I got I think I got to restart it.
There we go. There we go. I bet it told
me that, too. Just forgot about that.
Still, it says it's out of power. Oh,
here we go. Connect authorization will
result in immediate consequences. Okay,
there we
go. My bad,
guys. All right.
Building operates as usual. I even need
to need this
one. Can I put somebody
there? 12 out of
19. Have nobody over here.
Yeah. Here. Let me see if I can send
buddy to the
clinic.
Identifically stable. No incidents
reported.
All right. Inspection. Send him to I'll
wait one more day. I think we're allowed
to have him here for two
days. So, back to quarantine. Sir, I
feel fine. Please don't do this.
All right. Now, let's get some
sleep. Spent a lot of money today.
Let's get some sleep. Another one. All
right, I'll take it.
They're juking
us. Oh, damn.
I think I did a lot of damage to the the
wall. Oh, I died. There's the end of the
demo,
guys. Thank you for playing the demo
version of our
game. All right. Well, that was the
quarantine zone. The last check,
guys. I got to say, it's a pretty cool
game. I'm excited for this
one. I do wonder though if there's going
to be a campaign mode or some some sort
of story mode or if it's just going to
be pure
simulation. I do wonder. But we'll see
when when the game fully comes out. But
yeah, I love the the resource management
stuff, the inspection stuff. I do wish
the
trying to like finding the contraband
was a little harder. Like it was super
easy. You just had to open up
the the bag and it's right there.
But you don't really do anything unless
unless it has like it's
infected. You don't really do anything
besides confiscate
it. But yeah, it's a great game. I like
the little mini game too of protecting
the the border with the the
drones. You can see that getting kind of
crazy. But yeah, that was a quarantine
zone the last check,
