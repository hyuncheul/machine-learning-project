well underway once more and it's going
to be fascinating to see what
developments occur in this second half
[Applause]
just unable to get his cross beyond the
first
Defender green has
it Bice and out for a throw in just
missfire firing with the
pass
Shin what an
[Applause]
ABI
Park showing good defensive
judgment
it leads an accurate cross well it did
look promising but no threat in the
[Applause]
end oh that's a super piece of Defending
being egged on by the
[Applause]
crowd good looking cross oh a very fine
header but it wouldn't go in for him
well just listen to these fans they're
urging their team to score here and take
the lead playing it in well you can't
really had them any better than that but
the goalkeeper was up to the task well
behind for another
Corner high class defending right on the
goal
line clears it
away
and back now with Park had a chance to
whip it in here defensive roadblock in
the way of that cross counter attacking
chance looks as though he's alone in the
center and the flag has gone up not
really showing the game knowhow that we
tend to associate with him well he's got
to have a look around him there that's a
waste of a great opportunity is blocking
up the emergency exit please return to
your vehicle and move it as soon as
possible on attacking
possibilities
Shin well the host have had so much of
the ball in the last 15 minutes they're
creating plenty of chances and looking a
constant threat you feel they have to
take the lead at some point with this
sort of
domination well let's see if they can
win the ball back and create something
else not smooth in
[Applause]
possession Joe
St
Shin Park cross fired
over and it goes he scored on his debut
and his fans are loving
[Applause]
that well here we can see it again just
look how he plays this ball between the
Defenders and the goalkeeper It's a
Wonderful cross and then what a strike
that's hit with such ferocity certainly
no stopping that that's a great
[Applause]
goal Green and very nicely positioned to
win it
back in a position from which they could
potentially do a bit of damage
here using space on the opposite flank
now
[Applause]
there's credit for winning the ball
[Applause]
back
[Applause]
Shin the referee allowing advantage to
acrw to them oh just miss time his run
and the flag go going
up and unable to keep
possession just 15 minutes
remaining well they could have been in
but that's wonderful
defending into the advanced
position firing it in simple save
[Applause]
really
[Applause]
promising attack this a fine reading of
the
situation opportunity to deliver the
[Applause]
cross bad Challenge and now it's up to
the referee in terms of what to do
[Applause]
next 10 minutes to
go so almost at full time and the homide
on course to eek out a narrow win Stuart
your thoughts well their attacking play
has been excellent today however by
throwing so many players forward they've
looked vulnerable at the back which is
why this will be a nervy finish they
just need to hold on
here and space to cross
it and cleared
away
chance to do damage well it came to
nothing in the
end bodies forward and the break looks
on well that is how to break up a
Counterattack giving it their All In
Search of an
equalizer and he clears it out of Harm's
[Applause]
Way Green has it really good challenge
and the referee blows for a
[Applause]
foul
[Applause]
giving it a try and still danger here
well clattered
away and there it is the final whistle
the home fans are going to be happy with
[Applause]
this
[Applause]
me
everyone on tenter hooks you can feel
the tension because there's so much on
the line if they win they make it
through to the promotion
it is that simple do they have the
mental fortitude
necessary stay with us we have live
action coming up for you every kick of
the ball on EA
TV and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be in trolling
my name is Derek Ray and my commentary
partner as usual is Stuart Robson and if
things go well for them they can qualify
for a promotion match what might we see
today Stuart well thanks Derek what a
game we have in store here the
motivation couldn't be any higher a win
here and they'll get themselves a
promotion match it should be
exciting chech well they're moving it
around with three real purpose here but
they dealt with the threat
[Applause]
posed Gomez with
it and that was a very fine
read
Park it's a weighted
pass could be and a goal just what the
fans wanted to see the ideal way to
begin so the ball rolling again with the
score line standing at 1
n that's a very fine piece of
tackling
really well played
[Applause]
pass what to like about that
pass they couldn't maintain
[Applause]
possession a very effective play and
they might be on to
something well it wasn't a great header
in all fairness and a goal kick it is
[Applause]
Gomez
now well couldn't find a teammate
unfortunately and a throw in to
come they've won back
possession
Park
Stam plenty of
options
well nothing for them to worry about in
the end good
defending
check
stum
[Applause]
Shin oh lovely weighted ball they might
be
in and a crisp effort just over the
[Applause]
top
roach and they will be awarded a free
kick for
[Applause]
that roach and options in the center
well no problems
defensively Now options are plenty a
really good pass it has to be well the
post got in the
way and the attack fizzling
out well had that gone in the game was
firmly in their hands now though they've
got to make sure they don't let this
slip
[Applause]
and he read it
superbly and scope for them to produce
something exciting but quick thinking
defensively it's with Victor
Rodriguez
Johan well cleared away but at the
expense of a
corner corner kick played in No Nonsense
clearance Happ to take on the shot well
for p well that's a foul and it sets up
a free kick in a dangerous
position
and the keeper takes charge and dealing
with the free
[Applause]
kick and now their turn to have the
ball Rodriguez hanging onto the ball in
this fashion suits
them he continues his
run but the danger averted for
now oh might be a decisive clearance it
[Applause]
was
Stam well there it is the visitors have
completely dominated the game in the
last 15 minutes and their passing
patterns have created numerous chances
they surely must extend their lead
soon indeed perhaps they can cash in
again let's see
fired in there quickly and still
[Applause]
dangerous well nothing un to
[Applause]
happened
David well nicely cut out now what can
they do with the
ball that's a good ball could be off the
post some fact second
play well defensive Brazilians
there they do like to press whenever
they can Splendid tackle and a throw in
coming
up and just one minute of time added on
for stoppages well that's Splendid play
well you've got to give him credit for
that piece of Defending well clattered
away and the whistle is sounded for
halime in this game
[Applause]
L
[Applause]

[Applause]
we
[Applause]
so the two teams have switched around
and the second half is
[Applause]
underway
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
and crossed in the direction of the back
post but goalkeepers ball
disappointingly for
them and back now with
[Applause]
park now can they make something happen
and a good looking ball clearance left a
bit to be
desired and the attack fizzling
out really good
challenge oh the keeper made it look
routine it was anything
but but he took care of it
defensively can they take advantage it
could be up for
grabs that's what you call defending
from the front possibilities here L into
the box and a goal to really bolster
things for them two in front
Kare Advantage
played
wil and so 30 minutes left for play in
this
[Applause]
one and Gomez in
possession
oh really commanding
[Applause]
goalkeeping playing it in half-hearted
[Applause]
clearance oh and a perfect ball now how
about this not too fussy in clearing his
lines good looking ball there could be a
chance
now takes the shot he's blocked
it quick kick awarded then by the
[Applause]
referee eror from The Keeper will they
seize on
it pressure
applied and played the pass
well
very effective pass wonderful chance
good piece of
Defending well we have 20 minutes left
in this
game perfect
[Applause]
challenge well good run and good ball
control and intelligent threaded pass
here but into the Keeper's
gloves and back with
Rodriguez and nicely over the top Trine
cross into the
middle well nothing comes of
it
Shin Gomez now and they did have the
ball but not
anymore passes like that very much in
his
repertoire options in the middle it
comes to absolutely
nothing well this has to be their way
back into the game the crowd are
certainly playing their
[Applause]
part let's see about the delivery and
stopping the
Danger trying to open them up a matter
of keeping his composure and a goal it
was served up on a silver platter for
him it's a massive lead and it's very
hard to imagine them losing it
[Applause]
now
wil nice ball to switch the point of
attack and they have possession again
decent looking
pass laid to the center he does have
pressure to deal with and able to get a
body in the
[Applause]
way and support available oh surely and
still an
opportunity he cuts it back
really getting stuck in and what a
magical save it
[Applause]
was trying to pick out a teammate well
he'd love to have that header Back In
fairness he was being closely
[Applause]
watched
the referee knew that was Foul Play but
Advantage it
is and a simple clearance a good
one and the electronic Bo showing one
additional
minute a very effective play and they
might be on to something well there was
impending danger but good defending and
so the final whistle here the visitors
come out on top Stewart well Derek what
a good performance that was they did
most things right and their attacking
play was inventive and had a real
Cutting Edge that was a really dominant
display
[Applause]
from
that
I
