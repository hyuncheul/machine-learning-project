what a game we have in store here the
motivation couldn't be well the keeper
had a lot to do well it's a great piece
of goalkeeping so quick off his
line
Modric
Woods they've given it
[Applause]
away
seamons and passing it
[Music]
through Corner coming
up
now sending his in not too fussy in
clearing his
lines now room to roam on the wing for
the old
boys and block
there
gallager a really single-minded piece of
Defending to make sure nothing un to
happened
Anthony
now real attacking intent shown by the
old boys that's a nice looking ball and
the keeper really reacted brilliantly
well from that sort of range it's a
great save I have to
say and deciding to go short with this
one and it's played into the
center well nothing comes of
it
really fine piece of Defending play to
break us up on a clear foul but the
referee letting the play
Flow Modric well the referee allowing
the play to flow oh nice ball over the
[Applause]
top oh that's a super piece of
Defending King
[Applause]

challenge sight of
pass well she was up to the task
remarkable save yet again
inspirational and the goal kick is the
outcomes are in action tomorrow if you

office for more
information and that is
offside promising
pass defensive Brazilians to shut them
down
Modric
Anthony
ball played
[Applause]
nicely how about the
cross just the challenge that was
required
seamons oh surely tremendous defending
to Stonewall him
plenty of supports
here he's in with a
chance and there it is the Breakthrough
that will do
nicely and the ball moving again what
sort of response will we see from them
now
seamons and it's with
gun well read to win possession
back
[Applause]
can he put it in they've only gone and
grabed another one two goals in quick
succession now they have the lead no
wonder they
celebrating
gun getting the ball forward a good
Vision
there really good buildup but no end
product under real pressure here oh off
the post still alive and thwarting his
opponent in the nick of time and a good
take under duress
there well it's been a frustrating game
for them so far and that shot off the
woodwork just about summed up their
game and in the perfect position to read
it the cross is
on this looks more than decent time
intervention
seamons but he could run onto it here No
Nonsense
clearance Crossing into the middle well
but claimed by the goalkeeper and the
referee blows for a
foul
man and given
[Applause]
away woods with
it
Anthony and a tidy
tackle and passing it through
crucial piece of
Defending being pressed
[Applause]
here and there it is the half time
whistle
let's
see got
well underway once more and it's going
to be fascinating to see what
developments occur in this second
half can he finish this and that is
[Applause]
offside that's a very fine piece of
tackling and pull back and pure Instinct
from The Keeper well a top class
reaction from a top class goalkeeper
brilliant
stuff now sending his in it's still
alive and a goal it is but in all
honesty the keeper should have done much
much
[Applause]
better
tremendously strong in the
tackle oh nice ball over the top to
[Applause]
chase well the last touch came off the
defender so a corner
now now how about the short
Corner well far from the cross he had in
mind goal kick it
is
gun
Seamans this looks
promising but it Fizzles out thanks to
that piece of Defending chance maybe to
use the counterattacking ability to good
effect
looked like an effective Counterattack
but brilliantly
read and space here on the
flank and nothing comes of this
attack and over the by line goal kick
coming
up
Anthony what can the old boys do from
this position
[Applause]
and making his move inside but nothing
comes of
it nice looking
pass 30 minutes to go then working so
hard to win back
possession
Modric released it nicely and No
Nonsense defensive
clearance Distributing it well and this
situation could be
[Applause]
dangerous
Modric over the touch line for a throw
in we saw the situation developing
[Applause]
that's a good
ball oh that's a super piece of
Defending oh genuine chance textbook
defending inside the
[Applause]
box and cross into the middle excellent
block and into the last 20
minutes marvelous
anticipation woods with
it dicing with a bit of danger here it's
there for him oh tremendous save well I
have to say that's a magnificent piece
of goalkeeping that's a great
stop who can they pick out clearance
needed to be
better well threat avert
it not a clear foul but well it was a
promising Avenue of attack but the
momentum has been halted you wouldn't be
surprised to see they card handed
out
and played in not a very complicated
catch for the
keeper and trouble is
brewing has a
[Applause]
go
seamons well he stopped them in their
tracks
[Applause]
realizing that it might be opening up on
the opposite
[Applause]
flank well the old boys have the
advantage they're closing in on Victory
here Stuart well it's been a really good
contest you have to say but overall I
think they've just about deserve to in
the lead here can they now just see this
game through for what will be an
excellent
win this might be the perfect
counterattacking
opportunity it has gone over the touch
line for what'll be a throw
in now who can she pick
[Applause]
out that's a good looking pass is this
the moment crucial piece of
Defending
seamons well just listen to the
atmosphere in here the fans doing every
bit to try and spur their team on for
this
equalizer really fine piece of Defending
play to break us
up
[Applause]
gallager it has to be and that a piece
of goalkeeping you're going to see again
and again again and
again and the short option preferred in
a dangerous
position it hasn't come to very much
well having been awarded the corner
they'll no doubt look to put the issue
beyond all
[Applause]
doubt it's a short one now L the cross
work out for them oh but claimed by the
goalkeeper
seamons superb looking
pass well there was impending danger but
good
defending and so the final whistle here
the visitors come out on top
Stewart chances at both ends but they
probably just about edged it overall and
deserve the result in the
end
