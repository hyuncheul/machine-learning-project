advantage that's a good ball it comes to
nothing in the
end
firing it towards goal well good clean
catch by The

Keeper can they create something from
here timely
[Applause]
intervention what a brilliant pass now
what can they do from
here must take the lead here oh he's
been denied and they remain locked
together well that's a good save but
really he should have scored from there
that's a big
chance oh cleared away superb defending
massive
[Applause]
credit
excellent ball towards the front post
well not cleared away
completely on the Keeper's eyes well
that's a foul and it will be a
potentially dangerous free
[Applause]
kick well tremendous
[Applause]
block it has gone over the touch line
for what'll be a throw
going could be
dangerous good through
[Applause]
ball couldn't keep the
[Applause]
ball
[Applause]
matsuda
Sam they might be able to get in now and
Beyond the last Defender
[Applause]
offside deserves credit for winning the
ball
back
Alvarado has
it Alvarado an important
interception Al O'Neal please meet your
off this thank you
feni well that one has promise and coly
done the spite the mounting
pressure
[Applause]
alexe you can sense the threat is there
they try to take their time but not
enough Care on the ball
Mor feni on attacking
possibilities but really sticking to
their task
defensively brilliant
[Applause]
pass and there at breaks down but credit
to the
defense well doesn't have to do it on
her own
oh great
vision and players waiting on the
[Applause]
center now the pass not finding its
[Applause]
Target it is a decent looking attack
here with the game level let's see what
they can do with this corner well they
haven't created too much lately but the
fans know this is a chance to take the
lead
here playing it
short and Crossing towards the far post
and there it is the opening goal 1 n and
they'll feel they deserve
[Applause]
it Schumaker and given
[Applause]
away felini
[Applause]
they won't complain about having won the
corner and maybe an opportunity to
increase their
advantage and taken
short delivering it into the box
terrific block
there running with the ball confidently
[Applause]
he has time to play it over superb block
on the back of the ball from the flank
will spot on with that
challenge and we will have just one
additional
[Applause]
minute oh big opportunity and it's a
goal level again what a match this is
turning out to be
well that's going to be all for the
first half here at the home of
[Applause]
Arsenal
let
see yeah it's not the
best
so the two teams have switched around
and the second half is
[Applause]
underway oh good work by The
[Applause]
Keeper
over it comes well that's not a good
clearance well threat over for now now
perhaps they can counter from
here must be oh yes it's gone in and now
a chance for them to Rebel in the
moment well here it is again and it's
all about the pace on the Counterattack
they were so quick to break out from
their defensive positions and then the
Finish is fairly simple in the end
that's a good
goal corner kick awarded and let's see
if this will help them add to their
[Applause]
lead who can they pick
out emphasis on the clearance a good one
in a decent position now and fed
forward oh a goal and a known goal at
that well not part of the script was
it well as you can see it came off him
last and as a result it will be an own
goal so
[Applause]
unfortunate and both hands on it good
[Applause]
goalkeeping you saw the situation
developing could P one back here
marvelous anticipation
[Applause]
and over it comes the clearance wasn't
decisive well they can't quite take
advantage in the end racing forward
trying trying to catch them
[Applause]
out he'll be delighted to have won the
ball having made that difficult
Challenge and TI he
play and a decent
delivery oh you don't want to lose the
ball in that position well the keeper
reacted
magnificently
nice ball to switch the point of
attack oh no stopping
him well it came to nothing in the
end a really committed Challenge and
it's gone out for a throw
in well there you have it the a away
team have had so much of the possession
and they've made good use of it they
really have played some good attacking
football and they look like scoring
more
[Applause]
Mor
feni and the decision is one of offside
[Applause]
here and Crossing towards the far post
the save was a good one
[Applause]
can they take
[Applause]
advantage possession lost
[Applause]
intercepted just knocked it out of
there
faini can he get one
back that is how to keep it out of the
net and F
goalkeeping Well could this be the
Turning Point the fans are certainly
hoping
[Applause]
so favoring the short
one
it did look on for them but not to
[Applause]
be
wall putting all their energies into
winning back
possession a very effective
clearance now counterattacking
possibilities excellent ball over the
[Applause]
top sends it back and a goal is is just
what she was hoping to
contribute well we can see it again now
and it all starts with the pass over the
top it takes out so many Defenders and
then the Finish is fairly simple in the
end that's a good
goal well not too much defending going
on in the grand scheme of things
4-1
cleared
away exploting the wide
area well nothing comes of it it looked
promising well har and are losing the
ball really effective
[Applause]
pressing and the cross not quite
accurate
enough
feni and there it breaks down but credit
to the
defense the pressure was high and they
could be in here well misfiring without
any shadow of a
doubt so on the cust of the final
whistle and the visitors very much in
man Stuart well what an excellent
performance this has been they've had
complete control for most of the game
their movement clever passing and energy
have been a joy to watch oh Stewarts
they might be on to something well that
looked to be quite dangerous but just a
fraction
[Applause]
off but a good place to win it back and
let's see what it leans
to
Shaka and unable to pick out a teammate
and that'll be a
throw pressure applied can they make
something of
[Applause]
it well there was impending danger but
good
defending great
opportunity and this time it's in
fabulous goal and just look at the
celebrations well here's the goal again
and what a wonderfully weighted pass
this is and when through on goal she
makes no mistake she just hits it so
cleanly and with power that's a great
finish so 3 minutes of stoppage time
coming
[Applause]
up Advantage play
did well to win the ball
back room to maneuver on the wing real
chance oh that's a fine
[Applause]
save and over comes the
corner and so the referee blows for full
time and it goes down as a victory for
the visitors
well Derek what a good performance that
was
