I
it is a time for hoping for dreaming but
at the same time for believing the first
game of a new campaign and the
importance of getting it right on this
occasion isn't lost on The
[Applause]
Players there's only one place to enjoy
the action and it's right here with us
on EA
[Applause]
TV and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be enrolling I'm
Derek Ray and sharing commentary with me
as usual is Stuart Robson and ushering
in an exciting new season of clubs
action how's it going to go Stuart well
as always a quick start to the season is
absolutely vital therefore I'm looking
forward to a really good contest today
let's hope we get one
[Applause]
mialik
seamons and meat and drink pushing
forward with options available well
diving magnificently to make sure he got
[Applause]
there play over good piece of
[Applause]
Defending beautiful pass
well let's see about the cross it comes
to nothing in the
end well she must have plenty of
motivation because the next goal she
Nets will see her equal the CL D big
chance here and able to close down the
shots and the danger still
on well they can't quite take advantage
in the
end read that pass all the way cutting
it out
Onan couldn't keep
it danger here as he runs that in it
goes an early goal no wonder they're
[Applause]
celebrating so the match has restarted
One n
here
Onan good
movement oh it's a superb challenge very
[Applause]
timely
Stelling
khib
[Applause]
Park well nicely cut out now what can
they do with the
ball this could be
Troublesome and it goes that will
greatly help the cause now they only
need to keep concentration levels
High well here it is again the through
ball is absolutely inch perfect but
should the keeper be beaten at his near
post I don't think so he really needs to
do better in those
situations
nice wait on the pass but it looked as
though he might be on to something but
his timing left a bit to be desired yeah
that's frustrating cuz he's just been
too impatient there he doesn't need to
make his movement quite so
early was it a great
clearance very alert defending to put a
stop to the
chance what a brilliant pass
and that's destined to run all the way
through to the
keeper
seamons released it
nicely must
[Applause]
score cleared away
comprehensively
antoan can he get one back he can he's
given his team a real opportunity and
momentum is with
them and the ball is moving again
anyone's guess how this is going to
finish 2-1
currently
seamons
lamb
Sakai Swift ball into the area well
thumps
clear
stering
seamons a tremendous
Vision fed over towards the B post oh a
goal how about that for degree of
difficulty simply off the
charts well as you can see they don't
come much better than this it's a goal
of the highest quality wonderful piece
of
skilt
decent looking
pass oh that's a super piece of
Defending well no problems
defensively getting
forward and it took a little Nick before
it went over the touch line so a throw
in
here timely
[Applause]
intervention
well that one has
promise chance to make a game of it
here and he's gone into an illegal
position
[Applause]
unfortunately meat and drink unable to
retain possession real chance oh and
turned onto the
woodwork and a confident
[Applause]
clearance
Onan chances
on and defensive play to be
applauded
a lot of space to
attack well in terms of added time a
minimum of one
[Applause]
minute a chance then for the respective
managers to address their charges it is
[Music]
H
[Applause]
Mo let
see
so the two teams have switched around
and the second half is
underway he has time to play it
over corner kick fourth
coming well these fans can sense an
opportunity here they need to make the
most of this corner relatively
straightforward to mop up
defensively can he convert oh a powerful
effort
close
khabib now with
rasmusen
well moving the ball around nicely as
they try to get themselves back within a
goal must
be and the danger
cleared and the referee blows for a
[Applause]
[Music]
foul
seamons meet and drink exploiting the
space on the flank
that's a good looking ball well putting
all their energies into winning back
possession now he's got to stay
calm can they put it away so now a
[Applause]
corner who can they pick
out and stopping the danger here
Crossing into the middle under no real
pressure he has thinking
time can he take advantage well they're
going to be very crossed with themselves
because that was a wasted
[Applause]
opportunity
[Applause]
mialik seamons well that's one for them
to
pursue
well able to put it behind for what will
be a corner
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
here let's see about the
delivery and played the pass well oh the
flag has gone up and that's one that's
going to need a bit more practice on the
training ground well that must drive
everybody mad particularly those players
players in the
Box nice looking
pass nicely tying
tackle registration
SM one please return to your vehicle
immediately thank
you and the referee is quite rightly
letting it go good wait on that pass and
the No Nonsense
clearance
seamons that's a good
pass element of risk there but he's won
the
[Applause]
ball trying to really get at the
opposition
here well didn't seem to be in complete
control of the ball and a corner has
been
awarded well I take my hat off to her
because that was superb
defending and an astute piece of
[Applause]
Defending chance to cross and the cross
not quite imaginative
enough Corner
[Applause]
awarded
[Applause]
and over it comes no trouble at all as
far as the keeper was
concerned Onan can he find the right
pass and there's the feed into the box
oh it comes to nothing in the end really
should have made more of
that
[Applause]
stering just 15 minutes
remaining and passing it
through and quite simply wide of the
[Applause]
[Music]
Target and back now with
Park and just failed to keep the ball in
play that
[Applause]
[Music]
time could be
Troublesome well that's the sign of a
well organized defense the referee
allowing advantage to ACR to
them plenty of supports
here well well nothing comes of it it
looked
promising just 10 minutes remaining
[Applause]
here so the final whistle almost upon us
and this is not exactly what the home
fans had in mind when they arrived at
the ground today Stuart well there are
two main reasons why they're losing this
game firstly they've not shown enough
desire to close the opposition down and
secondly they haven't defended their box
well enough oh Stuart they've got to
score what a vital
[Applause]
intervention short Corner
taken now will the cross work out for
them taking care of business defensively
[Applause]
here could pull one back here W she does
and maybe just maybe there's enough time
for an equalizer it would be quite the
fenetic
turnaround released it
nicely textbook defending Inside the
Box well they might be able to launch a
Counterattack well they seem to be on to
something positive but it faded
away well the referee has instructed the
fourth official to put two minutes on
the
board well a successful intervention
winning the ball
back the referee spotted the
infringement and it will be a free kick
in a position of genuine
[Applause]
Menace
moving forward effectively well that
cross was more than acceptable but they
couldn't fire at
home leting to cross into the
center and there goes the final whistle
