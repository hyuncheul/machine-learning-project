there can be no denying it this is
crunch time the first promotion match
and no margin for error the players have
simply got to get it right out there on
the
[Applause]
pitch it's next on
[Applause]
eatv
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be in draing my name
is Derek Ray and sitting alongside me
ready to provide all the analysis is
Stuart Robson and a new experience for
them as they make their promotion match
debut Stuart tell us about your
pre-match thoughts yeah it's certainly a
big game today up to now they've been
really good can they just go that little
bit further and put in an excellent
performance here
[Applause]
promising attack
[Applause]
this
King well couldn't quite find his
teammate
Stam effective
press well it works like this breaking
the club's goal scoring record brings
you attention yeah what a great
achievement but he won't want to stop
there he loves scoring goals and I'm
sure there's a lot more to come from him
including a couple more today they might
score oh the keeper made it look routine
it was anything
but
so the corner played into the box good
well to clear it
away electing to cross into the center
and that was goalkeeping right out of
the top draw it's absolutely remarkable
his reflexes were brilliant
[Applause]
[Applause]
there who's going to get on the end of
it
oh a fine
block
Shin Stam No Nonsense
[Applause]
clearance and back now with
[Applause]
Park putting so much effort into winning
back
possession could be qued by the
[Applause]
post and problem solved for
now good play it
in well nothing comes of the attack when
all is said and done a good Vision there
might be a chance here
he'll be delighted to have won the ball
having made that difficult
challenge
Marcel still pushing for the goal that
would put them ahead but not forcing
it and the referee has given them a
[Applause]
corner
played
over and fling his opponent in the nick
of
time beading it
through and the Keeper's technical
skills there for all to see well from
that close in that's a really good save
such good
reflexes and over comes the
corner well a topn piece of defensive J
judgement delivered into the area
here well they can keep possession of it
now King not a poor touch and unable to
keep it in play throw in to
[Applause]
come
Marcel wonderful
tackle free kicker War Ed then by the
[Applause]
referee
Shin Stam retaining possession proving
difficult well that'll be a free
kick
[Applause]
possibilities Inside the
Box textbook closing down and now
they're on the
attack element of risk there but he's
won the
ball and a throw in it's going to
be
oh he's lost
possession oh what a topnotch pass but
mistimed his run well he's got the
timing all wrong there he just needs to
bite his
time they've lost
it
Shin Stam and stopping the
danger
defensive Brazilians to shut them down
bodies forward and the break looks
on just clarify the injury situation our
man on the side of the pitch is Jeff
shres feeling down here is that he
twisted his knee when turning he's been
testing out ever since but at the moment
he's carrying on she's
Jeff
Marcel Cuts in from the flank electing
to cross into the center and it goes the
opening goal in this
contest so underway again here 1 n the
score Distributing it
well well there's a living breathing
example of positional sense and coolly
done in the
end
the referee has decided that will be
just one minute of added
time and options in the
[Applause]
center the cut
back not away
completely well they can keep possession
now
so the whistle then we're up the halfway
stage in this
[Applause]
match
well they've got things going again here
and I wonder what kind of second half we
have in store for
[Applause]
us and players waiting in the
center well the flag has gone up here
offside it
is Stam pressing like that will help the
cause he has teammates around
[Applause]
him well showing good
Vision PS it
back able to deal with the
[Applause]
threat and that's an important
intervention
and he takes on the shot oh dealt with
by the
[Applause]
goalkeeper and over it comes and swept
out of
[Applause]
there that's a good
ball they need to get tier here chance
for the
leveler it might be was an important
piece of
defending and the counter looks on here
options
available can they keep it going and the
cross goes in pretty comfortable piece
of Defending they won't complain about
having won the corner and maybe an
opportunity to increase their
advantage and taken
short teammates in the middle well I
suspected that might be difficult for
the keeper but I was
wrong
not a decent idea but just slightly
overcooked
Marcel well we have 30 minutes to
go well they kept their Shake
defensively job done for now thank
you and nicely over the top oh genuine
chance oh that is a wonderful piece of
[Applause]
challenging unable to keep the ball that
time decent looking
[Applause]
pass the verdict is offside
[Applause]
here now the pass not finding its Target
nice waight on the pass and there it is
a two goal cushion now and they just
need to keep the
[Applause]
concentration so back underway with the
lead standing at
2-0
[Applause]
Stam
King could be
[Applause]
threatening chance here shot block but
still alive it's offside and perhaps he
should have been a bit more alert and
maybe a little bit more aware in the Box
he was just too
static Distributing it well can he get
one back but I think In fairness the
keeper was expecting to be worked a bit
more I can't believe he didn't score
there mind you nor can heat
just failing to hit the target with this
pass and it'll be a throw
in good use of
Advantage well this looks really
productive what can they do from this
position and tidy defensive
play and it cross the touch line so a
throw in here
[Applause]
High pressing and good high
pressing a quarter of an hour remaining
here good ball over the
top oh the threat is
there tinely
[Applause]
intervention
well I take my hat off to him because
that was superb
[Applause]
defending and intercepts again incisive
pass let's see if something comes to
this oh goodness me meat and drink for
the keeper well you expect him to score
from there but he just got it all wrong
didn't
he
and back now with
Park well that's good defending well
organized at the
back not giving him a moment's pece and
the danger is
averted moving forward effectively a
good and fair
[Applause]
challenge
plenty of support here and the ball in
behind the
Defenders and snuffed out the danger
immediately chance to
[Applause]
cross
[Applause]
shin and back now with
Park play to to the Box in
position oh it's in and a goal on his
debut no less what a way to endear
yourself to the
fans so on with the match 2-1 is the
score line what's going to happen
next and we will have just one
additional
[Applause]
minute and there goes the final whistle
much to the disappointment of their
supporters well Derek it was a poor
result but it was a really tight contest
both sides had their chances could have
gone either way but in the end they will
be
[Applause]
disappointed
there's more tension in the air than
usual and you can understand why if they
get the victory today they'll be assured
of a place in the promotion match and
that is nothing to be sniffed
[Applause]
at
stay tuned for all the live action next

TV and welcome to a game that really

Chance is on for them to reserve for
themselves a promotion match play

victory will give them access to a
promotion match it should be an
interesting
game really vital
interception Splendid defending and
collected tidy he had plenty to think
about
gun
Sans a successful intervention winning
the ball
back well it works like this breaking
the club's goal scoring record brings
you attention well he's got the record
but he's such a good goal scorer I'd
expect him to add a lot more to his
tally starting today what a talent he is
that's a good
[Applause]
ball well Time
Tackle can they take advantage oh she's
made the move played in low that ball
was put into the right area but no one
able to
capitalize
[Music]
Advantage

pass chance to finish oh great
[Music]
block and unable to keep possession
could be
threatening and a goal to give them the
lead they have their
reward now back underway and one n it is
let's see what happens
next and back with
Rodriguez
Shin Gomez with it
committed challenge good
idea and
K they've only gone and grabbed another
one two goals in quick succession now
they have the lead no wonder they
celebrating
Shin now they have possession in a good
area of the
pitch and it's opening up the POS gets
in the way not to
be
Johan it leads an accurate
[Applause]
cross on go is in possession can she
pick the right
[Applause]
option man well this looks really
productive what can they do from this
position could play it
[Applause]
in teamwork and passing in
evidence and just like that that they
don't have the ball anymore and the goal
kick will be
next
Johan Rodriguez with
it a tremendous
[Applause]
vision and a tidy ball and the challenge
hals them in their
[Applause]
tracks
Johan will he play it
in a really good
pass let's see about the cross well I
suspected that might might be difficult
for the keeper but I was
[Applause]
wrong
Sans and giving it
away can he find the right pass couldn't
keep the
ball in position sound piece of goal
[Applause]
keeping
Rodriguez No Nonsense
clearance and intercepts
again and passing it
[Applause]
through
there to win it
[Applause]
back the first half here comes to an
[Applause]
[Applause]
end
okay
[Applause]
so back underway and an intriguing
second half in
Prospect Distributing it well he can't
hold on to it we dealt with that ball
comfortably and the pass defly cut
out
counterattacking
chance and passing it well well it
fizzled
[Applause]
out
Rodriguez well they couldn't keep hold
of
it well Advantage coming into play and
rightly so and the flag has been raised
here well there can't have been a lot in
[Applause]
that an inability to keep hold of the
ball there moving into the advanced
position oh might
be it's gone in and well he might
celebrate on the back of
that three goals without reply
Shin it's with Victor
Rodriguez and easily intercepted with
tackling like that the onus is on the
referee to take action
potentially
and it's with
gun
King
man
Sans vital interception the danger was
very
real and into the last 30 minutes
now they've won back possession
well they might be able to launch a
counter
attack a good Vision
there now she could do a bit of
damage and a goal to seal the hatrick a
master class in finishing just can't
stop him
today a lot sided contest
[Applause]
40 really well played
pass
[Applause]
Sans possession
[Applause]
one and the ball in behind the
Defenders well there was impending
danger but good
defending and back with Rodriguez
good
distribution and there it breaks down
but credit to the
[Applause]
defense oh that's a really good
pass that's a very fine flame under
pressure
[Music]
they've given it
away
Rodriguez in behind for him to Chase and
an effect of clearance
just 15 minutes
remaining and the ruling is offside
here really getting stuck in a move of
promise on the
flank oh could
[Applause]
be chutting in what could he do from
this position a fine reading of the
[Applause]
situation
Stam and it's Gomez on the
ball well that is how to nullify the
opposition and giving them too much
space on the
flank
and that's an important intervention oh
big chance a goal here giving his team
precisely what they were looking for now
he deserves to celebrate
it
Park good waight on that pass
could be
threatening brilliantly
[Applause]
blocked and passing it through just
needs to stay calm and the goalkeeper
has outdone himself with that
save can someone get on the end of this
oh yes a goal exactly what they were
looking for and he's come up with
[Applause]
it well it's an out and out pacting 6
nil
Shin but on you go says the referee
Advantage now
Gomez a tremendous
Vision oh denied by the post
and that is going to be that well a tale
of Woe in terms of the score line as far
as the visitors are concerned here well
oh
dear well he was brilliant today every
time he touched the ball he looked like
scoring no wonder he's got a smile on
his
[Applause]
face
what
for
