okay chat today we're going to
react to the new cinematics of League of
Legends tomorrow is a
hope never I'm not sure they did for the
last few seasons I think they did is
that
trendir it is
is that who I think it
is the
sisters good night Agy thank you

oh my
God holy
[ __ ] what is that
Kayla's so
pretty oh it's the
ulti oh my God that is so
beautiful
[Music]
that came out of
nowhere
[Music]
is this
Yas yeah it
is what does it look
old it looks like ink Shadow
Yasuo uh he looks kind of older in the
ink shadow
Shadow oh that looks so
good Ash finally are we getting
something for the two of
them why he kind
of why he kind of o I'm sorry Ash I know
I love you I I have maned you before but
God
[Music]
dang oh
Kindred oh my God they finally gave love
to
Kindred
oh my God wait wait wait wait wait look
look look at look at the little motion
that that Kindra does
the look at the little motion of the
head
look I don't know why I love that so
much I love that so
much yeah get it get him get him on the
neck
is that
[Music]
Ash sorry I didn't mean anything about
stealing your
mans take him
oh she looks so good
oh I love that so much can I do it again
there's a lot of um ultimate
that was shown in the Cinematic and I
love that moronas um Tren deir with the
rage uh the undying there was a lot of
um skills from Ash I love the thing
about cinematics that I love so much is
when the skills in the game get
translated into the video and also you
don't often see the people here in the
cinematics I really do love that because
I think that when you kill trendir in
the game that is really how he dies or
am I seeing things oh that was future yo
he kind of bad though oh he look kind of
oh sorry I never appreciated
trendir in the game because he looked so
janky also I hated playing against a
Tren ofir you know I hated playing
against a good Trend ofir
um so this
cinematic love it love it oh love it you
know
what usually people say that Kale did
not love
Morana I know she did there's some
interactions that they have why you know
they both care for each other it's just
like they went through different paths
but but I love Morana Mo doesn't Kindra
just outright lose to
yasu look the only problem that I see in
this fight is kale has not reached level
16 look at what he did to my
Mor [ __ ] grab them face and you're
like I love her face so
much I love her face she looks so
pretty
oh the old again she looks so pretty but
you forgot your zus that's why you're
dying look at this [ __ ] her
sister is like giving her all and she's
like I'm going to do a thing that's
called
steel look at her that's the face of a
Kale man thinking yeah I carried the
game I thought it was going to be like
Jax or something like wow actually Jax
is a human
before and he was doing all this and
then he
that that'll be funny though right I
thought it was Jack right I thought too
I wasn't
alone and then I saw the hair I was like
yeah
y
oh
oh yo you're getting a little
rusty oh that's wolf I was I was
thinking it would be mlight or like
Malai in the mountains boy was I wrong I
I really thought it was something in
there imagine he because the are in the
middle like that and then he gets hit by
the splinters this is a 05 yasu
he's unlocked his full power oh that's
true why is
it that I thought it was Ash's Arrow
because there was in the mirror and I
was like Ash is actually saving y also
or maybe it's just transition yeah yeah
I know I was
joking and then like some of the subtle
details I'm
like is Brum going to come in
uh oh the
details I love
it imagine you're like if if they follow
like the lore
and then since trendir is old is like
basically undying like he's fighting 5v5
and then there's another extra which is
Kindred L be Ash what the
[ __ ] I Ash is so every time I I see Ash
enter
in Goosebumps I totally forgot tromer
exists love
it he just imagines everyone's
Kindred they look so good together like
okay here hear me out like I would never
imagin trendir and Ash had it been from
the game like from the visuals in game
but
here oh they look so good maybe it's
because in the splash art Ash looks
super young and trendir looks I don't
know he looks like something but here
though
dang oh I love that
anyway that year was
good I'm well fed
tonight
