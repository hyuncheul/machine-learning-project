can a diamond player be able to play in
a high Immortal valerin Lobby so I get a
call from this immortal friend asking me
to log into his valerin account mid game
cuz his power got cut so I quickly did
that but I was not warmed up shaking in
my boots cuz even though I can hold
myself up very well in Diamond lobbies
this was extremely high Immortal ELO in
the beginning I struggled a
little sorry a lot struggled a lot and
also got yelled at a few
[Music]
times but eventually I got a hang of
[Music]
it little by little we started moving
towards Victory and after few close
rounds we finally won it was a fun
experience and nobody was toxic except
me yo look at my Omen this B frag
Immortal 3 boosted as far
