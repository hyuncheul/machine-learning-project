Stuart Robson and looking forward to
bringing you action from the Premier
League coming right up it's Newcastle
United up against

coach I played under would always tell
us before pick off earn the right to
play if you can win your individual
battles outrun your opponent eventually

ability I'm sure that's being echoed by
the coaches here
today
so they
[Music]
start 11 for Newcastle United well it's
a 433 formation with a center board and
two Wingers so it's important that the
Midfield players give support to the
striker whenever the ball goes wide they
can't allow him to be
isolated at the starting 11 for Spurs
Dean kuski plays with teoa out wide and
the striker today is H

ninon you never quite know who's going
to emerge from the shadows and become a
match winner but this man might be a
decent shout what are you expecting to
see from him Stewart well Derek he's a
great all round player he's an ability
to run in behind Defenders that makes
him such a threat and when he gets one V
