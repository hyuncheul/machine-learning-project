the day is here the match everyone has
been talking about and with good reason
two teams of Strong pedigree rich and
Talent on the cusp of going head-to-head
in a highly significant confrontation
with so much to play for how will it ban
out it's coming up
live one of the great things about
football is that no one knows for sure
what's going to happen let's see what
unfolds here tonight my name is Derek
Ray and joining me for commentary is
Stuart Robson and the stage is set for
clubs match action Stuart what are your
expectations for today well Derek we can
talk about coaches and their methods but
it's now down to the players which ones
are going to stand out who will affect
the game and who will have the greater
desire it should be a cracking game
though the
Young
and Cristiano has it now and a goal just
what the fans wanted to see the ideal
way to
[Applause]
begin so underway again here one n to
score ESS
Campbell on the
ball Reed now and take it
away and Cristiano has it
now
Dong Well they keep the ball
moving well honestly I didn't mean to
jinx them just wasn't a very good pass
finally
well there was impending danger but good
[Applause]
defending Now options are
plenty
gr
Kell
bler Stone possession given away
unfortunately
promising attack this but it Fizzles out
thanks to that piece of
Defending got a mobile phone handed in
if you've lost your mobile phone can you
please High pressing and good high
pressing
thank a chance to whip it in that's a
cross he would rather like to airbrush
from
history
[Applause]
and that's very intelligent play to win
back
possession determined
defending
Stone
gr now the pass not finding its
Target in a position from which they
could potentially do a bit of damage
here and he favors the inside route must
score and a goal and you've got to say
they definitely took a deflection off
the
defender well here's the deflection as
you can see you can't blame the
goalkeeper he was just wrong footed
there now with D
[Applause]
young
Stone
gr
Keller
bler
Stone a very good
[Applause]
tackle and there's the feed into the box
but it's actually ended up being easy
meet for the
keeper the
young
gr
Stone
Keller
gr and space for them here on the
flank oh an incredible clearance I must
say I didn't see that
coming who can they pick
out not all that convincing
defensively and problem solved for
now a foul it most certainly was free
kick
given chance to
cross and couldn't really direct it
where he
[Applause]
wanted
GR
do they mean business on this
occasion excellent
[Applause]
defending
etto and he clears the
danger
ESO textbook defending Inside the
Box well this could really must take the
lead here and they have you've got to
say it has been
coming well here you can see it again
good run great strength and a composed
finish Under Pressure that's a top class
goal
and the ball is moving again anyone's
guess how this is going to finish 2-1
currently Keller intelligent threaded
pass here almost found its Target but
cutting it out in the
end and nicely over the
top and teammates to play it
to
and one minute of stoppage time has been
added
on well the F want to see a shot and a
strong glove on the ball from the
keeper and the whistle is sounded for
half
[Applause]
time
over
so the two teams have switched around
and the second half is
underway
ESO Reed now might be able to produce
from this
position players waiting in the
[Applause]
center is it going to end up being
productive for
them nice looking pass well they dealt
with that ball played in rather well can
they do something positive on the
counter
attack but quick thinking
defensively Campbell on the
[Applause]
ball no lck keeping possession
[Applause]
and back now with
Cristiano and passing it well it might
still be
problematic well no way through in the
end it has gone over the touch line for
what'll be a throw
in and back now with
Cristiano
Stone it did look on for them but not to
beo so a half an hour
remaining but he was in the right place
to
[Applause]
intercept
[Applause]
Keller
and danger reverse it well
read
bler
Stone
gr and that was a very fine
read the referee allowing advantage to
acrew to
them over the touch line for a throw
[Applause]
in
gr
Keller will it happen for them well a
classic example of how to
intercept
clear to see who got the last touch so a
throw in it'll
[Applause]
be but I think just lost his Focus for a
second and a throw in
conceded well that's a completely wasted
throw
in oh good Vision could be in here oh
how about that for a
tackle and the counter looks on here
options
available well possibilities in the
center well it was a terrific piece of
play that was until we got to the
finishing part well as you said great
Counterattack but a wayward finish in
the end good to watch
though putting so much effort into
winning back possession
[Applause]
appear to be in two
mins oh that's magnificent goalkeeping
and now we find out it was offside
anyway well the referee not too happy
with the challenge and blows for a free
kick
well when you can keep the ball like
this it's got to be really annoying for
the
opposition losing possession a bit
[Applause]
easily now we're inside the final 10
minutes in this
[Applause]
one ESO and a free kick awarded by the
referee
[Applause]
now who can she pick
out and there it breaks down but credit
to the
defense
Blair they've got to be really mindful
of the time situation attacking though
they might be well unable to bend his
run
offside
Cavani it's a weighted
pass he might be on to something and the
keeper making sure that was pushed well
away from
danger that leads an accurate
cross well they'll be looking to add to
their advantage from this
corner
[Applause]
played
over and a simple clearance a good
one now who can he play it to well still
pushing forward it's a matter of whether
or not they can come up with an
equalizer the save was a good one well
the corner it is and they know they've
got to be opportunistic at this stage of
the game
[Applause]
game playing it in crucial intervention
just then amid impending danger the
referee blows for full time it ends at a
victory for the home team no complaints
from the fans here well Derek it was a
really tight game but they were the
better side over the 90 minutes and they
fully deserve their Victory
today

happened
let's see about the delivery well the
keeper dealt with the
[Applause]
danger
Ru well that's the sign of a well
organized
defense
Reed
might be able to produce from this
position and the cross goes in taking
care of business defensively
here
Cavani intercepted
effortlessly
pool and the pass not quite accurate
enough and a throw in
[Applause]
[Applause]
then
Distributing it
[Applause]
well
sugu well they win the throw following
that
challenge
Reed now and a good looking
ball this looks
promising that's a good
ball well that's how to do it inside
your own penalty area so a corner here
[Applause]
over it
comes and cleared behind for what is
going to be a corner
[Applause]
kick
and taken
short
ESO great vision to switch the
play and whipped into the box that in
fact a good but straightforward claimed
by The
[Applause]
Keeper wilting under the pressure and
now they tried to go forward decent
looking pass and well positioned to
clear and a fine
[Applause]
cross and the move breaks
down well there's a really stylish piece
of
running well possibilities in the
center comfortable in dealing with the
cross
oh nice ball over the
top angles it
back well it wasn't a straightforward
save but credit to

tackle can they trouble the opposition
this time oh that's a really good
[Applause]

distribution and coly done despite the
mounting

applauded and it was turned out so a
throw in will be
[Applause]
next

opposition at
Bay
sugu good move in the making this from
snakes

play so a throw in to

now on the last touch off the defender
so a corner coming up just Len to these
fans they're urging their team to score
here and take the
lead let's see about the
delivery just wanted to get it out of
[Applause]
there and the decision is one of offside
here and the whistle is sounded for Hal
timee in this
[Applause]
game
and as the second half commences both
sides can reflect on a first half in
which they were so very evenly matched
ESO wonderfully weighted
pass can they prize them open now could
take the lead oh my goodness he's caught
that so well a goal of the highest class
fantastic technique
well as you can see here it all starts
with a perfectly weighted ball in behind
the Defenders while the movement in the
box is equal to it it's such good timing
what a
goal dangerous looking through ball now
the task is to remain focused sound
piece of
[Applause]
goalkeeping
suu
pool Ru with it and passing it well and
clears the
danger corner to the snakes what can
they do with it
well these fans have had to be patient

it in the right place to cut out the
pass he's waiting in the middle this
could have possibilities it's given him
something to
contemplate can he do it well you can't
argue with finishing like that superb
[Applause]
stuff well just look at this he couldn't
have hit it any better could he this is
the the perfect example of a bicycle

tighter not the pass he had in
mind well breaking at PACE is always a
possibility

end plenty of room for this biggest
snake's
attack crossed into the penalty
area well it comes to nothing in the end
well that is how to play
Advantage they've regained
possession
puol Ru has
it
sugu and now Radu has
it well it's looking Danger us here from
the biggest
snakes this could be it terrific piece
of
anticipation another goal from this
corner would in all likelihood secure
Victory playing it in r oh it's off the
post and efficient
defending well that would have made
short of a well-deserved Victory but
they're not quite there yet this could
Square the
game and the goalkeeper under no
[Applause]
pressure and now Radu has
it well over the last 15 minutes the
biggest snakes have had the majority of
possession as you can see from those
stats and you sense another goal is

now long way out oh terrific free kick
and how well the keeper did to Parry it
he's driven in the corner danger still
