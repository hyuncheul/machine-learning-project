and did his
job Felipe
Anderson that's a lovely ball can he
give them the lead oh my goodness he's
caught that so well a goal of the
highest class fantastic
technique and the ball moving again what
sort of response will we see from them
[Music]
now and a good challenge to bring that
attack to an
end
ruzi immobil
now promising
sequence well it came to nothing in the
end well a clear foul but the referee
letting the play
[Applause]
Flow
Martinez dearco could be
and a goal to really bolster things for
them two in
front Mato

mkhitarian Mato

turam onto barela a good Vision there
emphasis on the clearance a good
one the attack looks
promising barela well a classic example
of how to
intercept
[Applause]
Wendi alesandro
Baston from one side of the pitch to the
other
tan targets available cross comes
in and there we have it the first half
comes to an
end
[Applause]
and back in business here it was a
dominant performance from inter in the
first 45 what will the second half have
in store for
[Applause]
us it did look on for them but not to
[Applause]
be
Luis
Alberto well he has the measure of his
opponent well the fans really want him
to shoot and Crossing towards the far
post but he took care of it
defensively nicely timed
tackle Felipe
Anderson difficult to stop
him and he's broken free he can't hold
on to
it well they can keep possession
[Applause]
now good ball over the top and the flag
does go up
[Applause]
offside Anderson oh that's a fine cross
can he fin here a goal as they cut into
their advantage still plenty of life in
this
[Music]
[Applause]
match and after that fantastic effort
it's gone out for a throw
in unable to retain possession
Distributing it
[Applause]
well well there was impending danger but
good
[Applause]
defending
marusic 30 minutes to go then and they
continue to advance and a lot of options
[Applause]
here lazari chance for the leveler well
he so badly wanted to net another one
but the keeper playing his part well
maybe that should have been his second
but you can see another one coming he's
playing so well
here danger averted for
[Applause]
now and the referee takes exception to
the Challenge free
[Applause]
kick
and it cross the touch line so a throw
in
here Luis
Alberto onto
lari Felipe
Anderson more than decent passing
sequences but they need a leveler
opportunity and a decent save full
[Applause]
credit favoring the short one
cuts it back what an important piece of
[Applause]
Defending Alexandro
Baston into the final 20
minutes well as you can see in had much
less of the ball but their attacking
play has been really incisive it's been
a really good display from themselves so
far more defending for them to do here
though
Maric
imob and inches away didn't miss by very
much at
[Applause]
all
chanu
and now def
fry it's with
chalano
martinez big chance and he scored not
once but twice they simply cannot stop
him and no wonder he's enjoying
himself promising attack
this really important tackle
[Applause]
rendi and giving it
[Applause]
away Martinez well that's how to keep
the opposition at
Bay but in the closing phase and Inter
really have seen everything go to plan
for them in this match yeah clearly the
better side obviously being fantastic up
front but it's their work ethic for me
they're just not happy unless they have
the ball and they're fighting to win it
back whenever they do lose it it's been
a really great performance all
[Applause]
around not the pass he had had in
mind oh good skill and he's managed to
beat his
[Applause]
man well that's common sense refereeing
to play
advantage and very defly cut
[Applause]
out could be
dangerous well he moved into an illegal
position well he had the vision to pick
out the through Ball but he couldn't
play it quite quickly
enough
cuadrado well they stopped them in their
tracks Advantage
played
toam and the electronic board delivers
the news two minutes of stoppage
time Luis
Alberto now the good
tackle oh did well to skip through it's
there for him and there is the goal to
make it a hatrick excellent and that
will do it the referee brings this match
to an end inter entitled to be happy
about this because they picked up
maximum points from this game what did
you make of it well Derek they were the
better team all over the pitch we saw
good individual performances we saw an
attack
[Music]
I am the
one am
the am the
lock them
UPI Rocky I'm coming up they call it
 a billion plus nothing can stop me
we are the ones who come out beating the
drums we are the ones in slums with
blades in blood we are the ones who do
what they've never done we are the ones
want and we running it
[Music]
up
that special and unbeatable feeling of
match day is in the air and the
knowledge that this has all the makings
of a vibrant well nights like these are
just what you hope for as a spectator a
warm welcome I'm Derek Ray at the
microphone and joining me for match
commentary is Stuart Robson and everyone
here on tenter hooks you'd have to say
with good reason Stuart how do you see
this one going well thanks Derek this is
a big game today a win and there'll be
six points clear a loss and it'll be all
square at the top but I do think they're
the better team and as a result we'll
win this
game and a look at the inter team Yan Z
is the goalkeeper alesandro Baston plays
with Franchesco AER in central defense
Henrik mcari and starts alongside Luis
Alberto fine tackle there to prevent the
chance
[Applause]
[Applause]
now attacking possibilities for the
nurri well didn't go to plan in the
[Applause]
end mato
gendi turam
excellent
defending effective piece of
pressing Luis
Alberto now Felipe
Anderson
lazari really fine piece of Defending
play to break us
up shown inside
[Applause]
turam barela has
it he got in the way of that cross and
he's gone into an illegal position
unfortunately nikolo
casali and plenty of scope to be created
in that wide
[Applause]
position timely
[Applause]
intervention and Inter could get in
behind the
defense will it be it's still alive but
no that's the end of the move because
offside is the verdict Luis
Alberto
the ball with Luis
Alberto immobil
now Manuel
laari into recovering possession
well incisive pass and there it is 1 n
the efforts have been rewarded and look
at the
celebrations Manuel
lazari it's with
ranoli
wuzi
Zaki immobile
now
romanoli not the pass he had in
[Applause]
mind
barela
[Applause]
on the
offensive but a good piece of Defending
to bring it to an
[Applause]
end
Martinez so a throw in
[Applause]
here chiro
[Applause]
iMobile
now with
gendi moving the ball nicely trying to
carve out the equalizer I think I spoke
too soon wasn't the best of passes
[Applause]
finally
quadr barela has
it
toam
nicely timed
[Applause]
tackle
[Applause]
Anderson just wanted to get it out of
[Applause]
there Luis
Alberto and easily
intercepted
[Applause]
Mato
gendi the ball with Luis
Alberto Manuel
lazari
Wendi that's a lovely ball unable to
keep the ball and defensive play to be
applauded well nearing the halfway stage
it's so far so good for the theuri
Stuart time I think for your assessment
well it's been a tight game so far but
oh hang on Stuart big chance here oh a
stab piece of
Defending Martinez
[Applause]
mkhitaryan Martinez
Martinez it's gone in well they're
really in the moon here can they be
stopped
[Applause]
Martinez this could be
Troublesome the first half here comes to
an
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
end
well they've got things going again here
and I wonder what kind of second half we
have in store for
[Applause]
us and Inter Havoc once
[Applause]
again
IMO oh that's a super piece of
Defending
a real struggle to contain him oh great
vision he's in with a
chance and pure Instinct from The Keeper
well a top class reaction from a top
class goalkeeper brilliant
stuff and over comes the corner oh a
very fine header but it wouldn't go in
for him well they'll triy to kick the
pressure on in the form of another
corner
well it still could be
dangerous behind for another Corner can
they cash
[Applause]
in over it
comes but he took care of it
[Applause]
defensively
[Applause]
Zaki has credit for winning the ball
[Applause]
back Manuel
lazari Lera regaining
[Applause]
[Music]
possession
[Applause]
dearco Manuel Lazar
[Applause]
lazari tremendous
block Martinez but into ball
lost Alberto could reduce the deficit
brilliantly
blocked so a half an hour
remaining and that'll be
offside
[Applause]
Wendi wasted possession
[Applause]
again and danger revers it well read
well Foul Play says the
referee huge
[Applause]

Marcos

barela the final whistle has sounded and
my goodness things are going swimmingly
for them in the title race they take a
commanding lead at the summit well
they've been excellent so far and today
was no different that was a really good
display it's surely only a case of when
rather than if they win the
title but in the final analysis Laro
Martinez did his job what did you make
if what he put into the game well he was
a major reason why they won today he was
so reliable and he inspires those around
