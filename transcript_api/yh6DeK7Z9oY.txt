hello and welcome and I can tell you it
was a dry walk to the Gat Tre today no
rain in sight I'm Derek Ray at the
microphone and joining me for match
commentary is Stuart Robson and
understandable that there's a bit of
extra excitement in the air after all it
is the first match of the new campaign
Stuart how do you see this one going
well thanks Derek promoted teams often
do well at the beginning of a new season
and then fall away but I think they're a
good side so I'm expecting them to have
another good campaign and start with a
win
today the initial 11 today for the hosts
Ru Patricio is the keeper Leandro
Paredes plays with Leonardo SPO there it
is and just the ideal start
and the ball moving again what sort of
response will we see from them
[Applause]
now Crossing
possibilities it's a pu Lukaku well good
clean catch by The
[Applause]
Keeper Kim
now Harry Kane an effective
challenge deala really is obsessed with
taking the game to the opposition but
can they produce from here surely The
Equalizer oh there it is a back and
forth s of match now they're level again
the lead lasted nearly
minutes so back underway they've leveled
it at 1-1
here
Pan and the ball with alons o
Davies it's with Kingsley
colan
gab can he put them in front but it was
a wonderful chance but the goalkeeper
comes through yes Derek we have to give
credit to the keeper but surely he
should have scored there that's a big
big
chance well Bayern Munich have
possession again
[Applause]
San
San well read to ease the
pressure now can they make something
happen
San it did look on for them but not to
be
[Applause]
dybala Harry
Kane
WEA now with
Kim
Kanan still pushing for the goal that
would put them ahead but not forcing it
lost possession
Kane and kman distributing
shrewdly and a goal to reestablish their
advantage just look at the
[Applause]
celebrations well here we can see it
again he's shown outstanding Vision to
find the perfect cut back and then was a
finish
that the keeper has no time to react
it's a brilliant
strike well Bayern with the ball
[Applause]
again
meano and Kim on possession is the watch
word inside their own
territory delightful pass
[Music]
Lukaku
Lukaku and a shot from someway out and
that wasn't a Million Miles Away almost
The Equalizer well it's not a bad effort
is it but they've got to find a way back
into this
one
kman and the ball with Alonso Davies and
fed forwards
[Applause]
Jamal
musiala pass from kman might be
productive and a goal here for B it's
going to be so difficult to th them
[Applause]
now well as we can see here the pass
from kman is absolutely perfect and then
it's a top class strike from Kane his
technique is absolutely spot on just
look at the power he generates
here
San The Tackle completely mistimed and
you would expect a booking under the
[Applause]
circumstances and he does produce the
yellow card yeah and it certainly
deserved a yellow it's a poor challenge
you have to say
[Applause]
closing down
well
mazwi and it's Kim MJ
San now kimy oh opportunity oh not to be
stopping a certain goal come on and not
cleared away properly and routine for
the keeper in the end the cross far too
close to him well that could easily have
finished the game off but what an
excellent save that
was
Kim upano
usala not getting anxious when they have
the ball well after pressing like that
maybe the short route to
[Applause]
goal and nicely struck denied by the bar
back in play
here well so close to extending their
lead there just a matter of
inches Lukaku
Kim now Harry
Kane authoritative attacking play from
dybala this
time good use of Advantage by the
referee in bayern's
favor and the fourth official confirming
that we'll have one additional
minute dybala
[Applause]
the first half here comes to an
end and we're focusing on him for a
reason Stuart he's asking plenty of
questions of the Defenders well I think
he's been outstanding so far he's looked
a constant threat and he scored a very
good goal what a player he is
[Music]
and back in business here Bayern very
much bossing it in the first 45 let's
see what this half has in store for us
[Applause]
and that was a very fine
[Applause]
read Harry Kane and threading it through
he might be able to make it through and
he finds a net he could hardly
[Applause]
Miss well let's take another look yeah
he won't get an easier finish than that
the defending was all over the place
[Applause]
though intercepted effortlessly
[Applause]
kman he failed to hold
it
dybala they're not cherishing the ball
the way they usually
do
pman might really be able to trouble
them here really good buildup but no end
product
opportunity
here and a goal that's his brace they
just can't keep him
quiet well let's look at this again he's
done superbly well to pick out a
teammate here and then the Finish from
Lukaku demonstrates his ability to make
the right run at the right time what a
good
goal able to skip fast as man
[Applause]
Kane excellent assessment of the
situation at the
[Applause]
back what can they do from
here can't miss
surely a goal here giving his team
precisely what they were looking for now
he deserves to celebrate it
just look at this again the combination
play in the top third of the field was
so precise and gav's movement and
penalty Fox awareness makes this finish
look easy that's a nice
goal but he could run onto it here
San timely
intervention Brian cristante
it's with
dybala Bayern regaining possession
[Applause]
here
Kim excellent
Vision well the pressure from his
opponent was
telling now they have possession in a
good area of the pitch nice waight on
the pass and a goal he's doubled his
total for the day in superb scoring
form well here we can see it again it's
a beautifully weighted B behind the
backline and the Finish from kanate is
excellent he times his run he finds that
bit of space and he was never going to
miss that
the pressure being exerted couldn't keep
the
ball the cut back and this time it's in
fabulous goal and just look at the
celebrations well sadly we have to
conclude that this hasn't really been a
contest but all credit to any side
committed to scoring goals like this
[Applause]
mazwi well a good
tackle released it
[Applause]
nicely breaking at
PACE
mazra and the opinion of the referee
that is a penalty well that is what they
didn't need to lose a player in this
fashion well what can you say about that
what was going through his
[Applause]
mind oh and it goes now he has his
hattick a special moment for him
well let's take another look he chooses
the right way to dive but it's a good
penalty cuz it's the height that beats
him as it goes above
[Applause]
him
Kan good work from Bayern to make sure
possession changed hands
yua
Kimi
sane he must finish a goal how about
that he's put it away to make it a
[Applause]
hattick well if there were any lingering
doubts about the outcome surely they now
have been
removed 10 minutes to
go e
well the weather forecaster has promised
us an agreeable day for football and
that's exactly what we've got my name is
Derek Ray positioned here on the
commentary Gantry
and e
sitting next to me ready to give you all
the analysis is Stuart Robson and no
question this ought to be a game that
gets pulses racing it is Bayern Munich
up against inter well it was a good
start to the season wasn't it Derek
they'll be looking to repeat that today
and if they can make it six from six
they'll start to believe they have a
chance at the title let's hope we get a
good game
here here's the initial 11 for Bayern
Manuel Neer between the posts nus mazra
plays with Alonso Davies in the fullback
positions Leroy Zan plays with Kingsley
Kanan in the wide positions and the
story in attack is one of a strike
partnership and Bayern could get in
behind the defense
here the inter starting liner Yan Z is
the goalkeeper Franchesco AER plays
alongside alesandro Baston in central
defense Henrik mkhitarian starts
alongside Nicolo barela in the center of
Midfield and leading the attack today
Laro Martinez plays alongside Marcus
Duran and Bayern Munich now in
potentially a dangerous
position and Bayern the recipients of
the free kick
[Applause]
here and he's clear as lines
gabri can he make it count and the
keeper more than equal to
[Applause]
it yua Kim with the corner and fling his
opponent in the nick of
[Applause]
time well you get the feeling when you
watch Harry Kane that he dedicates
himself daily to being the best player
he can be Stuart what do you expect to
see from him in this match well the best
players can well somehow the goalkeeper
got to
[Applause]
it and play in by kimy found wanting a
bit with that
[Music]
[Applause]
delivery good technique displayed can he
put them in front oh no he's missed the
opportunity and they remain level well
he just lack composure there didn't he
they should be ahead
now real
chance can he convert oh that's an
expert piece of Defending just as it was
looking
threatening
Martinez well L couldn't have on to
[Applause]
it Jamal musala beautifully waed
ball that
be wasteful again in
possession Henrik mikitarian
[Applause]
Francesco AER
def
fry it's with a
chbe alesandro
Baston
dearco
[Applause]
mkhitaryan onto barela but a crucial
intervention Inside the Box
Alonso
Davis
colan now with
Ken Harry Kane slips it
through oh you don't want to lose the
ball in that
[Applause]
position Franchesco
AER on the ball
Stone
Martinez a chance to whip it in well it
did look promising but no threat in the
end
San
wasala got himself forward pretty well
here Harry
Kane the crowd encouraging him to take
it
on
Martinez given away by
in
lucala
gab and it's opening up and it's come
off the keeper and there it is a goal I
must say much to the annoyance of the
[Applause]
keeper well here it is again and the
striker does everything right he hits it
across the goalkeeper which makes it
difficult for him and then the player
coming in is alert for the rebound what
a good goal that is he's going to be
disappointed with that pass
[Applause]
Manuel
Noya
mazra
San gabri with
it Leroy Zan the attack looks
promising
San interception to Snuff out the danger
[Applause]
turam and Bayern doing well to win back
possession timely
intervention but he must get rid of the
[Applause]
ball and I think the has been
[Applause]
averted the first half here comes to an
end what a really committed first half
performance by Harry Kane Stewart well D
he took his goal well and was a constant
threat throughout that first half I
thought he showed a lot of skill to get
out of tight situations and he had a
real impact on the play
[Music]
so underway once again and not enough
went to plan for inter in that first
half can they address that in the second
45
gabri a goal for ban to extend their
advantage
[Music]
well here it is one V one against the
keeper and the outcome was never really
in doubt he never looked like missing
that and Bayern doing well to win it
back
San return to
gab chance here oh good work to deny the
opportunity
[Applause]
the corner from
[Applause]
Kimi spot on with that circle and a good
take under duress
there dearco well you can tell what the
fans think of that decision they're
certain it should have been a
[Applause]
penalty and boiled only by the crossb
[Applause]
far Harry
k a free kick decision going the way of
Bayern and intercepted
it we
well the supporters think it's on
wonderful block very alert defending to
put a stop to the chance and the referee
is quite rightly letting it
go and passing it through and now can he
keep calm and pure Instinct from The
Keeper well a top class reaction from a
top class goalkeeper brilliant stuff
[Applause]
Serge
gabri Zan has
it Harry
[Applause]
Kane very effective passing sequence
decent looking pass will it be Harry
Kane oh a stab piece of
Defending
Martinez
barela well L are a bit wasteful in
[Applause]
possession
Kim and
Kim
Wala and the challenge HTS them in their
tracks
kman Harry
Kane
usala and return to
Kane and defensive play to be
applauded
chanu counterattacking very much an
option
oh good
Vision a goal that's exactly what they
needed that should get them believing
again so there we have it
21 s
[Applause]
[Music]
now with
Kim
Lua can they convert and quing his
opponent in the nick of
time
barela now the quick Counterattack could
be
on well they profit from this situation
well unfortunately it fizzled out in the
end
and the ruling is offside
here it's a substitution for
Bayern well he's been forced out of play
this time
[Applause]
[Applause]
a really single-minded piece of
Defending to make sure nothing unto
[Applause]
happen enter fighting against the clock
and the score line but still they
believe well to be blunt misfiring with
the
header Kimi
Serge
gabri Kane took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
them might be a chance to
break
toam now with
Martinez and Bion able to win the ball
back and we've entered the final 5
minutes
[Music]
Martinez couldn't grab hold of
it well that's a sad end to the
attack
kman and taking it
away time and the score line against
inter but they're not out of this
[Applause]
barela Splendid defending and it needed
to
be counterattacking
chance well that is how to break up a
Counterattack
Martinez well the corner it is and they
know they've got to be opportunistic at
this stage stage of the game elects to
go
short Ching
in and reading it absolutely
superbly and there it is officially the
end of the game Bayern get the Victory
and take the three points from this game
what did you make of it well Derek they
didn't dominate the game by any means
today but overall they had the better of
the chances and just about deserve their
win
and The Shining lights for his team no
two ways about that Harry Kane well that
performance sums him up really you're
never disappointed with what he gives
you such a good
player and they kick off here
gabri can he make it
count and the keeper more than equal to
it well somehow the goalkeeper got to
it and it's opening up and it's come off
the
[Applause]
keeper and there it is a goal I must say
much to the annoyance of the
keeper a go for Bayern to extend their
advantage
[Applause]
and passing it
[Applause]
through well a top class reaction from a
top class
goalkeeper oh good
Vision a goal that's exactly what they
needed that should get them believing
again
well to be BL
[Music]

and it really is a sparkling day for
football at one of the great venues in
the world game The estadio Santiago
bernabo in Madrid I'm Derek Ray
positions here on the commentary Gantry
and alongside me at the microphone is
Stuart Robson and if this game lives up
to its billing we're in for a riveting
occasion It's Real Madrid up against
Bayern Munich well Derek as he always
the case the team that dominates
Midfield will be the team that controls
the flow of the game and that for me is
the area that's key
[Applause]
today and here's the starting 11 for
Real Madrid tibo CIS is in goal David
Alaba plays with Antonio Riga in central
defense Jude Bellingham starts alongside
Eduardo kaminga in the center of
Midfield and they line up with just the
one Striker looking to do a bit of
damage
it will be a Bayern
corner and drawing it back oh he
couldn't out with the
keeper Venus
Jr well B have come out and started this
game at a terrific pace and really
should have taken the lead there they're
only denied by a very good Save By The
Keeper well here is the Bayern side
Manuel Noya begins in goal nus Maz he
plays with Alfonso Davies in the
fullback positions Kingsley Coman starts
with Leroy Zan in the wide positions and
so many different ways to configure an
attack in this case it'll be two men up
front oh tremendous
Vision well the keeper had to intervene
under a bit of pressure
there CR to them for winning back
possession
Kane teammates
available
s looking for the right
[Applause]
angle corner for Bayern then
[Applause]
can someone get on the end of
this pressure applied can they make
something of it and the flag has gone up
here offside the
decision Eduardo
[Applause]
kaminga looking for that final pass
looking for the goal that would put them
ahead
can he convert great
defending and the challenge crisp and
[Applause]
clean he continues his
run but timely defending when it
mattered
NAB could be
dangerous that is a tackle and a
[Applause]
[Music]
half venicius
Jr
Rodrigo and he stopped them in their
tracks
and
Bellingham pivotal moment
defensively good use of Advantage by the
referee in bayern's
favor Serge gabri and support
available Kane and defensive play to be
applauded what a magnificent pass and
the flag raised offside it is
Wala they might be able to capitalize in
the wide position
Bayern fine tackle there to prevent the
chance
Bellingham and
[Applause]
Valverde
Carvajal federo valde
[Applause]
and
Bellingham to give them the
advantage Bellingham and there it is the
opening goal 1 n and they'll feel they
deserve
it yua
Kim Harry
[Applause]
K Zan has it
[Applause]
here's Kim
MJ Alonso
Davis
kman Bayern have given it
[Applause]
away aelan
Chui they find themselves in a position
of Menace well nothing comes of it it
looked promising
[Applause]
venicius
Jr well he certainly not
[Applause]
alone venicius chance to finish oh that
surely had to go in but marvelous
defending Harry Kane
[Applause]
that's a good
pass well somehow the goalkeeper got to
[Applause]
it well that's how to do it inside your
own penalty
[Applause]
area and that is that halime here in the
Spanish capital
this man will get most of the plaudits
for his contribution up to this point
Stuart well I thought he had a really
effective first half not only did he get
the goal that gave them the lead but his
General play was really good he was a
constant threat and I'm sure we'll see
more of him in the second half
[Music]
second half underway with real looking
to build Upon A positive first half
[Applause]
showing and he CS in from the
wing and roal pushing to add to their
lead it'll be a
corner just cleared away away in the
nick of
[Applause]
time
Rodrigo can't miss surely goalkeeping of
the hunt and the referee doesn't
hesitate that is a spot
kick to extend their lead here a goal
calmly taken spot
kick so two n now
well you can tell what the fans think of
that decision they're certain it should
have been a
penalty
mazra now with u
meano yua
Kimi
kman and Real Madrid have it back
now flag Rays for
offside shuami
now with
Bellingham oh nice
ball well the fans really want him to
shoot oh good defending to stop a decent
looking
[Applause]
attack opportunity terrific piece of
anticipation pressing like that will
help the
cause venicios junor
the referee spotted the infringement and
it will be a free kick in a position of
genuine
[Applause]
Menace well considering the position of
that free kick that was an outrageous
effort so close well it's a great strike
but just not quite the accuracy he was
looking
for Harry Kane
and a good challenge to bring that
attack to an
end and teammates around
[Applause]
him the crossbar got in the
[Applause]
way well the Woodworkers just denied
them a three-goal lead here but you just
can't see them throwing this one away
can you
[Applause]
just straying
[Applause]
offside
kman
musala
Kane David Alaba from awarded for that
brilliant High
Press
Kane he's in with a Chance oh superb
save massive credit to the keeper well
he's so hard to beat in these situations
it's brilliant goal
[Applause]
[Music]
keeping now with Ken
Jamal
musiala promising move this from
Bayern San onto
gabri and collected tidily he had plenty
to think
about
Carvajal Orelia
Chui
gabri reduce the deficit it could be up
for grabs and there it is but hang on
the flag has gone up and it's not going
to count well it was a close call but he
is just offside good finish mind
[Applause]
you
rudiger aelan
Chui and into the last 15 minutes of
action
well making considerable progress with
the
[Applause]
ball
[Applause]
venicius now with
Rodrigo oh could be oh that's a fine
[Applause]
save Alonso Davies
[Applause]
but he's certainly not
[Applause]
alone oh chance
perhaps well no degree of difficulty for
the
goalkeeper sloppy from
San
[Applause]
Rodrigo the free kick decision going the
way of
[Applause]
Bayern Serge
gabri and passing it
through oh good save well not so fast
the referee says penalty and maybe a
late glimour of Hope for
[Applause]
them well I think it's fair to say
angelotti doesn't agree with that
[Applause]
decision can they get one
back and the spot kick is converted as
coldly as you
[Applause]
like well here's the replay and the
goalkeeper chooses the right way but
he's a bit unlucky because the strike
goes above his body it's a good penalty
it's the height deat him on this
occasion now as they kick off again 2-1
the current state of
[Applause]
[Applause]
affairs individual
Brilliance Rodrigo
[Applause]
here's venicios J well no way
through well adding up all the stoppages
we will have two extra
[Applause]
minutes plenty of supports
here he must finish oh it's in and that
might be the goal and that is going to
be all for this game anyway a defeat but
given their previous form they still can
be thinking about the title Stewart well
that was totally out of character today
they've been really good up to now but
at least you could see a game plan and I
would say they're still a team that can
clinch the
title and in the final analysis A really
positive performance from this man
Stewart well that performance sums him
up really you'll never disappointed with
what he gives you such a good player
