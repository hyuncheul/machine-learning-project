volume a little bit higher than I'm
normally because it's is
Cinematic tomorrow is a
hope who's that never a
promise ROM

I haven't seen trir in a cinematic in a
long time I feel
like what is this kin Morana before
Morana turned
evil
e away it could all here
[Music]
this is [ __ ]
sick holy [ __ ] this is so
[Music]
[Music]
sick I didn't even know atrox could
fly it makes sense though he's wings
I don't know why I didn't think
that it is
Morana is it I don't
[Music]

though
no not the innocent
civilians is
[Music]
Ja or just a random good
[Music]
person
[Music]
oh it's
yasu you had a stick
[Music]
earlier I like that they go out of the
way not to show any like you know
decapitations or blood even though he's
literally slicing them with a
sword got to keep it PG respect
[Music]
[Music]
that
[Applause]
wa to be honest Tren should win One V
one risk Kindred like in game not in
lore like in lore Kindred has to be
stronger than
[Music]
friend
I'm still
[Music]
here it's his
[Music]
wife dude that was sick there's so many
characters that we like never seen in
the other cinematic actually Tren Ash
and Kindred that was that was
insane Kindred looks so cool and Tren
looks so buff bro like they did I mean
obviously he has to be he's [ __ ] look
at him bro this dude is
ripped you wish the wolf was that I mean
like I wish anything was that cool in
game but like the Cinematic is just
I don't know ride cinematics always hit
this one is so good maybe maybe because
of recency BU but I I rank this like
pretty highly as far as the cinematics
Go I mean the the last one
um was kind of a Miss for me
uh the pantheon one was actually very
cool I'm trying to I'm trying to
remember is this the one where they're
just um she's just
walking yeah now I will yeah this this
one was a Miss
unfortunately um there's nothing
happening it's just somebody narrating I
think it's powder from Arcane No No Cap
like actually powder from Arcane talking
the whole time th this this one is up
there with the climb you guys remember
the
climb uh not Miley Cyrus this one this
one I'm not going to play it but this
one was so good I me maybe not by
today's standards cuz it's 5 years old
maybe probably even by today's standards
then when Lucian does the
calling so
good anyways very good very good um I
think I'm just going to get into playing
now
