[Music]
oh when I get old I'll be looking back
wishing it could last forever oh yes
day seems so far away long dress no
shoes summer nights golden and blue it
feels just like we're stuck inside a
picture
frame these memories Never Fade
Away oh whisper to me we got the world
right at our feet and I just want to sit
right here and look at you
that's probably all I ever
do oh when I get old I'll be looking
back wishing it could last forever oh
yesterday seem so
far away where did it go all of the
night all the time we spend together oh
yeserday
see you
soing gling
[Music]
gling
wake up and smile cuz you're beautiful
those hazel eyes when I get off that's
all I want to think
about I probably shouldn't say the
sound loud I hope big drains the little
scared way to my they can you always be
mine and never leave my
side LIF these numers Never Say
Goodbye Oh when I get old I'll be
looking back wishing it could forever oh
yesterday see so
far way where did it go all of the night
all the time is sp together oh
yesterday see
so
far
nice
nice
