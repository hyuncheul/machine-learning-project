all right we got game two first aali
this time should be a lot more difficult
until we get snowballing again I guess I
don't know col is annoying but we're
also playing an equal annoying Champion
so they should just cancel out should
just be a even matchup
right swimming brand jungle the thing is
brand and vain I'm going to absolutely
one shot poppy support
think is going to be annoying she can
cancel my Q Dash I don't know if she can
stop my e since I go un
targetable now we strike all right I did
not get I got one
minion she doesn't have Doran Shield
second well she might have second wind
don't have a Doran Shield though I'm not
really the champ to run a Doran Shield
against cuz I don't poke
her
thanks please don't have e please don't
have e okay she got w
I should have went Doran Shield against
her with how much she's going to
poke
nice jumped over it got a nice little
trade on her I go hit that minion she
would have hit a Q on me I still got the
minion anyway
though I mean I I think I'm favored in
fights up until she presses shroud after
she does
that can't really hit anything on her I
can hit e she going to cue this
no uh hello how you
doing you lost little
guy I'm ready okay I hope you find your
way they take his oh did brand take his
blue
BR you dirty
rat you're not supposed to take that
poor mummy's blue
buff I want to go kill him but K's got
me pushed
in all right let's trade really
quick
an enemy well kind of outplayed her
pretty hard
there s she landed the E and she's 100%
going to take it so I flash under turret
takes turret shot I win the
fight what a robbery he got out with it
oh no I'll scare him I'm trying to scare
him no no oh he has flash okay he's good
let me you a well my wave's kind of
screwed I can't go get this cuz poppy
brand and vain are over here but I got
an
alternator is this the same person want
to see a
trick
not oh she doesn't push this way
I'm still ahead of her
but get less Farm looks like it's going
to slowly come to
me she flashed away right after I
brought her under turret but it wasn't
enough come on brand does massive
amounts of damage I need to make
sure all right I wasted my
you and I missed the minion with
it it's just if she's pushed or if I'm
pushed up too far I just got to be
careful because no I have to run so far
away and if Bran's here and I use my E I
don't have anything to get away and I'm
dead I'm going to try and bait out her
shroud though
nice swimming
oh no he's
good she over chased a little bit too
far oh my God I got nothing oh he's
ghosted I don't know if I can kill him
actually yes got
the he's low but like not low enough
because even if he lives with like 5% HP
he's going to kill me cuz I'm pretty low
myself
me I can start walking down maybe I
could do
something o
fruit
a where is the brand I saw him over
here oh this could be a double double
trouble let's pop you of d
yes you
do I don't even need to Al holy cow the
Fizz damage I mean they're two levels
below
me that's kind of crazy I couldn't e
after the poppy blocked my
U want to see a
trick it locks you out of movement I
think for like 2 seconds or
second
well this game's actually kind
of going faster than the last one so
maybe this might be I'll show them a
watery gra first game we'll
see
no this game as the second one but if my
Lanes lose this game I'm going to have
like 30 kills just cuz I'm going to one
shot everyone but they do have Champs
that are going to be able to kill me
back if I go in and don't make it
out cuz even though they're going to die
a lot AR I cancel this stupid auto reset
I've been noticing that this season it's
like I'm canceling auto resets like
crazy no fear I would alter but even alt
Q leaves her healthy still hello
fireman goodbye
fireman oh I didn't use my w I think I
oh well
calling
me I didn't use my w there I guess or
reset from killing brand I don't
know could have killed
her now we
St
um that gu oh good Al although Mort aled
after he aled so he just steals the
stats back but I think yeah M's going to
die to the turret that's really good
ready so we don't even have the Sor
shoes yet this game and last game we got
the Sor shoes before we even had the
storm
surge they won't catch
[Laughter]
me did I say something about twitch
Prime in the Zago video is that why all
you coming into that
an enemy
has
in yeah the nice thing about Fizz is you
can oh hang on the nice thing about f is
I'm
de I'm an enemy saying is you can trade
someone under turret and then just jump
out oh fudge he ghosted to
need to stall some time here one jump
ahead of
you think I just
execute an ally has been
slain they get XP but no
money that's
cool whool with me no money for
you
see move speed or 10 more
AP I'll don't take the move speed I got
to get
back I mean I still had flash so that AI
wasn't going to kill me there but oh
she's going leandre's first or
Rift to the feel like she's going Rift
maker
brands on grubs I have my eyes on this
Canon now I can bu up an enemy um I mean
we
can I just hope he doesn't want
me you don't like a mo if he gets too
close oh jungle's actually winning Lane
pretty hard I could have sworn he was
losing based on uh let's go that
dive I just need to not get hit by that
e if I don't get hit by the E she
doesn't really have any
damage probably wasn't expecting this
goodbye Bo
strong yeah there's aali and yon's every
other game
like sure the Champions don't have maybe
they do have high win rates I don't know
but I mean I feel like even if they Nerf
them people are still going to just play
those
Champions
so not really much we can
do until people start just playing like
counter picks into them like Nautilus
and stuff and just make their life
hell yeah those kind of Champs they make
you feel like you're a God at the game
because you're doing all these like
flashy moves and whatever even though
it's not it's really not hard to
do and even if you feed you're not out
of the game
so the ti
turns
they're good champs for noobs but the
problem
is I feel like the people who play those
Champs they rarely ever get better at
the game cuz they're stuck in this
endless loop endless play
style of learning how to just all in
with a broken champ but if they play
anything else they run it down because
they're not playing something so broken
and strong they don't know how to they
don't learn how to farm with those
Champs
shut down they won't catch me your team
has destroyed a
turret trying to teach my girlfriend how
to get better she's just hitting gold
but I noticed she's running into a point
where she's not really getting much
better it's cuz she's not really trying
she's trying new champs but she's trying
all
like hard Champs like High ELO Champs
you don't want to play High ELO Champs
when you're at low ELO
so I'm going to try and have her play
nasus cuz I played nasus when I first
started getting good and nasis I feel
like teaches you to scale teaches you to
farm teaches you to last hit and nases
is so ungodly broken even if you're not
that good you press you hit Level six
you press R you all in you win pretty
much every 1 V one it's just the problem
is you have to play nasis
then I might die
here my Q got cancelled she flashed my
e we'll just leave
it I'm not going to risk
it I need to go by lit Bane is really a
big Power Spike I also really need Sor
shoes like yeah NASA is boring to play
but like do you want to get better or do
you want to just
be stuck in the same
Loop see a
trick like do I use I have all my gear
listed on my website it's mostly updated
I have a little tab you can see all the
Amazon links if you do buy something you
get like five bucks or something
depending on how expensive it is
see like I could jump in here probably
kill one of them but I'm not doing
that why am I not doing that because I'm
going to die and give them 1,000
gold so it's not worth it for me to get
an extra 300 gold just to give them
1,000 to make this game
harder so a noob would have went in
there they've been like ooh kill
somebody's low I got to get a kill but
then they die and then they end up
making it more difficult than it is
should have where's the ve and the poppy
go now we
strike like sure maybe I could have
gotten out of flash but am I really
going to burn everything for a chance at
one
kill
this dragon's actually like they really
made infernal Soul even more snowb with
these things because the team that's
ahead is going to die less so then
they're going to have more souls um why
am I going up here I don't know if I can
I mean should we try I think I might
actually be able to one shot
him well not anymore H do he have a ward
or something why did he just back up I
must have got
spotted
this weird that he just randomly
moved I'm
ready but you got to get good enough at
the game to learn like I I saw that
situation and I knew like if I go in
there like at best I'm going one for one
which is not worth so there's no reason
to go in there somebody not as
experienced is just going to just run in
there and
die they don't think about it before
they actually go
in aash like I guess it it works for
almost anything if you're really good at
something really skilled at something
you know what's going to happen before
it happens I
guess like Vin just go
boom
she's going to alt in again watch she's
like man I just pressed R I got to use
it again she's going to dash in while
try and damage me oh kind of
smart but now she's
dead she would have maybe been out if
she didn't eat at the end
there he usually the aali really like
using that R again
was good on her for holding
that um what do I see hourglass I mean
hourglass would actually be pretty good
here man wow this cost
1,600
7 I'll actually just take this because
we're nine and one we give thousand gold
shutdown if we die this game is not over
like we could easily lose this game so I
should try and not die SL power glass is
so vital on fizzz even if I'm against AP
targets because when the armor is good
for keeping me alive and then the
stopwatch after i e in I'm dashless for
a
bit pop her
Shield oh we don't want that's not the
personal deep I'm try and bait brand
down
here
and then I just kill bran cuz Bran's if
bran doesn't build hourglass he's going
to die in one shot every single time I
hit him with a
shark see you later alligator see you
later
alligator see you
later
oh Mobility
baby come on let's
go
I didn't get
the how much damage I did the mor there
I proed storm surge just off hitting him
with
qw destroyed a
turret I think Po's W's back up it
definitely is now
I'm just trying to save the
turret like they're trying to bait me to
go in I'm not going in I know what's
going to happen now Sharky's back up Mr
Sharky might go in and then I can maybe
think about oh hey how you doing I mean
if I don't see any of her teammates
around her I want to pop that Shield cuz
it's a
crown see he could steal this
now I had options there I could have
jumped over the wall and stole it I
probably would have died die for
infernal Soul maybe be worth but I don't
know about a th000 gold shut down they
won't catch me I probably should have
win for it cuz I did Kill brand with
just the
shark is you're a coward see I a coward
for not letting them kill
me who was up here was it Popp
in
aash oh I'm the
coward Miss banshee's
Veil
okay got to be next level coward to
build a banshees Veil on a
collie oh and there goes your alt One
Jump Ahead of
you nice
alt well the thing is there's going to
be more infernal dragon so I think it
was worth as long as I just don't do a
stupid death and die for no reason now
for my next like if I do
die want to see a
trick a you're
it you know what let's just kill her
she's not Invincible I mean look it she
has two Mr items and she blew
up come on let's go well the brandall
didn't bounce Mor is somewhere up
here they're going to Clump up and this
game's going to get hard but amumu is
really good for that I haven't really
seen Ash Arrow
anyone like even though I'm even more
fed than last game this game's actually
harder because they have stuff that
counters me and they have a lot of
damage and they're they're playing a lot
safer they're not just running out in
nowhere they they put down Wards they go
as a team they hold hands like three
people to I could kill the col brand but
then I might die to Mizer at the end
but I should be able to get one and get
out if I do find an opening just a
banshee's veil really stops me from just
using R right away and the crown needs
to be popped on her
too like I don't want this game to
become an A so maybe I'm just going to
go split B and see if I can get them to
chase me I'm
ready they already are
my team should be fine alone as long as
they don't go too far
out I feel like Poppy's just going to
follow me
around the
turns yep here they all
come they won't catch
me oh my
god dude their whole team came down here
though in a
spash oh see I screwed up I didn't think
her W was up for some reason I thought
I'd be able to flash an e out but she
just counters me so hard darn that was
stupid of me but hey look actually good
team though do something on the side of
the map cuz I was like you know if they
send four people B we probably should
like get a turret but we got Baron your
turret has
destroyed the poppy vein are very hard
to deal with though if I can't just one
shot him stupid poppy W just hard
counters
me I think I need a
void like they're just they just only
going to build magic resist so trundle
is going to turn into our
windcom One Jump Ahead of
you I might need you know what I could
do I could build a banshees Veil and
that would stop the poppy W from hitting
me I don't think they have they don't
have alt we can fight this I maybe I
need to take out Mor first I don't need
Al to
kill I'm bursting him before he can all
and oh my God he got blown up all right
I lose mid turret don't care your tret
has destroyed I could flash Q Vain and
it's going to do
like it's just really annoying poy is
just
waiting oh my God that a call
damage it sucks cuz poppy is literally
waiting every fight for me to go
in we just we don't have an ADC like why
is she not alting why is she not helping
us enemy double kill we're playing 4v5
unfortunately your team has destroyed
brand had a big alt I didn't even notice
that he was on Dragon already but it
just sucks like I'm getting poppi wed
and then blown
up she's so mad a Callie so M she's just
trying to like make herself feel better
that she's
losing but in reality like her teammates
are much better than mine so she's like
got a much easier time in these
fights want to see a
trick H we need trundle to
split the problem is like we actually
just don't have an ADC like what was Ash
doing that whole time she's just like
permanently farming
mid it's just weird to the like if we
had her there we probably would have won
like imagine vain or a colie getting hit
by an
arrow the poppy even has TP the PO
literally just follows me around the map
encounters kill
her oh hey she
arrowed there we go that's all we need
is literally just engage
pick's going to need to grab B
though see the thing is if M's not dead
though if I get Mor aled after I jump in
I'm probably dead too Ash is going going
to get bought that's
fine I mean at least she's
playing
somebody come on let's
go she it's just the Assassin player ego
man she just can't accept that
somebody's outplaying her so she has to
just make [ __ ]
up congrats dude you have poppy
permanently standing on top of me the
whole game and I'm still beating
you I mean I want to try and split the
thing is if I split the the enemy team
literally goes wherever I go
so
swimming well 131 if they it could work
if they go either side lane we'll just
get
a we'll either get mid turret or the
other lane the turns I think it can work
I just need to make sure I don't get
[Music]
caught
oo
where is
he I think there's a ward
here oh okay there's at least three up
here I mean a mumu's here I don't think
we should fight this
but all I can't get cof out of the
way you're not out playing me though bro
I'm going to ignite her just CU she
doesn't die don't move
oh my auto still went
off and Rundle hello gromp is not
like oh I'm so dead here it's worth not
really but she could have killed me
without even dying those thing like why
are we taking a pit stop at Grump bro
you could have got an inhib by now
where's your
wave they all died to a collie mid it's
whatever trying to go go go oh vein's up
actually you need to leave
it like I feel like if trundle didn't
just like stop
pushing
uh we're going to lose soul I
feel that's really sucks that we lose
infernal we're just outclassed
outnumbered of
teammates
yeah his Biz gets hard hard hard
countered
by at like 2K I'm just hard countered by
a stupid poppy full tank full magic res
this poppy that sits on top of me the
whole
te I just like trle if he just TPS top
and pushes top he needs a TM at he
pushes so slow too
and now they're all going to come bot
can we just push top please or go to
Baron one of the other unfortunately I
think we are actually going to lose this
game unless we get a lucky pick in a
fight CU like their whole team is
playing like they're trying so hard to
stop me full magic resist builds sending
everybody for me
well my team is like so slow to get them
to do
anything like but if if the trundle is
on the enemy team the dude takes my
inhib turrets before I'm even out of
Lane but this guy like is so damn slow
oh they're not here an ally has been SL
they went to the Dr or the baron oh of
course now she doesn't want to fight me
hey Ash got it that's
good an ally has been SL
she live Get Out Alive that's
fine come on we have some Barons if they
just
live
dude she just pushes me out of
everything man it's so
annoying flash TP poppy support is
actually their strongest player is a sad
thing I need a banshees I
think
I mean if he just dies for it like don't
be scared of her just get
it get this
too he can get out alive that's good
job BR I just like one V4
them sakali is like literally the
stupidest person I've ever
seen what is is this guy
doing what are you
doing
swimming we just need one fight where we
can get them one by one maybe we do
group as five and try brand has
hourglass now so I can't even kill
him but I think splitting is the way if
like imagine if trundle had a tmad it
wouldn't take him an hour just to push
one
wave I'm ready well this Banshee should
help
me they're
fighting but looks like they got out
good we got them in a good one 131
here they have to choose now who they're
going to go
for is a ga they just have so many damn
defensive
items all I got two of them down
here in
a
nice and they need to watch out and now
I need to push down here
before before they go die to vein
they're dying come on trundle push bro
you're literally in a lane vers nobody
how you the
slowest we can break open this
base of
Coursey Cy in vain permanently on my
ass
well we got the inhib now we just swamp
it's like there's nothing I can do man
I'm so hard countered by
this
um want to see a
trick can't kill poppy even though I
have magic
pen can't kill V's
G we need trundle not to die right
before this dragon's up though
issue oh this guy
got like it's kind of crazy how their
top laner who like a Bruiser tank is
actually the easiest one to
kill
Elder could really help us Ash could you
please come
here we should just force 5v5 or
whatever oh theying
it I just burn
itar oh nice we got him before he could
uh
oh no is that our jungler oh we win Ash
did something wait we got to get this
bro okay we win vain stayed in base
there's no Vin they need
Vin I got to [ __ ] talk dude she's
shitalking me the whole [ __ ] game I
deserve to be able to [ __ ] talk for once
I normally never talk [ __ ] to people cuz
I'm smurfing but like she actually
deserves it
oh yeah Ash farmed she has 300 CS Ash
farmed all game for this
moment go Ash pop
off good thing just scaled all game for
that
vein why is she not
talking why are you so quiet a Calli oh
yeah it's bot Lan's fault now cuz
nothing's ever your your fault stupid
[ __ ] assassin players
bro you never learn anything I was
literally like teaching you guys this
whole game she's never going to learn
she's never going to learn stuck in this
end endless loot playing a collie
everything else is everybody else's
fault sure you can beat people in a 1 V
one that's what your Champion does but
you still couldn't do that against
me all right not bad it just took this
team at least they listen to my calls
they're just really slow Ed it I mean if
Ash just played with us a little bit
early I actually should have gave it to
amumu amumu at the end there got the
good picks but I mean like as soon as
Ash started team fighting with us and
playing like we it was so
easy trundle had really low
damage much damage the
structures
uh all right well not bad I thought we
were going to lose that game and it
would have been feeling bad to lose this
trash talking
AE oh we did
51k
damage and what is 7,800 on this I mean
this game could be its own video by
itself yeah make sure to like comment
subscribe I'll see you later
peace
keep hting since she has no
flash
nice um she doesn't have TP so I could
stay and try and push
this I'm curious to see how this build
Works without a Mana item cuz F used to
go ludin but now he doesn't even build
that cuz the new ludin is
terrible I'm not going to be able to get
the casters she's not going to let me so
we'll just
leave
swimming thanks for all the twitch Subs
guys make sure you join the Discord at
discord.gg zag there is a giveaway in
there I'm giving away 10 of my keyboards
it ends in like a week I'd say I don't
know when
exactly we are going to get the
alternator the alternator is really
strong this season 50 AP plus 63 damage
that scales by
level so when I jump in and Trader it's
going to do a lot of
damage want to see a
trick
I was going to let it shoot one more
shot I don't think it would have
survived I was going to take presents of
mine instead of Triumph but I'm like you
know what the extra gold might be nice
to help me snowball and we're going to
get blue Buffs you get blue Buffs a lot
more these days and after 20 minutes you
basically everyone gets blue buff on
each team so then when you kill somebody
if you don't have it you're going to get
blue buff too
so
I think they made it so as W refunds
full Mana a few patches
ago so you can just farm with it let's
go activate our
alternator the mighty shark STS his
PR now we do have less haste this season
but I have more damage so that's fine
fine did do a lot of damage to me there
though I mean her flash will still be
down I don't want to lose more of my HP
before I hit level six let's see is
she's still here I think I can Auto
these
ones it
down she's so
aggressive I mean I have time to just
base
here
somehow she healed the full I guess it
was her potions I don't
know one jump ahead of
you she might base here cuz she's going
to use the rest of her Mana but it's
whatever every time I Dash she gets an
empowered Auto attack against
me and I have two
dashes my e might even count as two
dashes on its own and then q s three
getting fruits again she's so
dead I might still go for
this the blind into the nocturn ks is
kind of br BR that
sucks at least she
died oh he should have probably popped
his Al at the beginning of the
fight little unlucky nocturn waited so
long just to flash and steal
it but it's okay Vex died Deo is going
to have a nice Bounty for me to claim
later darn my way wave is kind of bad
too
swimming just need to not get ganked by
a hack from right here
now look at
you that wouldn't do that
well I even traded with
her is decent I pretend like I
based wish I had my Shark up though I
don't have enough damage to kill her
though she's just a little bit too
healthy she really just uses her
spells
nonstop I'll show them my
bra
probably
basing
yep uh you know what we'll try and roam
after this base want to see a
trick she's kind of difficult to kill
alone CU of her shield and her fear but
if I go to a s Side Lane and just kill
Teemo or Jin it's probably
easier
almost have storm surge I could grab Sor
shoes here though only getting 10 AP if
I'm this delays my storm surge but I
think this is worth I need to get around
faster is I lose so much CS if I roam
cuz she pushes pretty
hard
I mean noon's finally level six so he's
a champion he can
gank Jump Ahead
so up
here now I'm stealing that one we're
even she shouldn't have flashed there
after she got hit by the shark she's
just automatically dead if nocturn
alting too now if it was just me she
could have lived but since nocturn was
there too not so lucky for you I don't
know where heam is I'm surprised he
hasn't come in at
all
he's just like power farming oh nice
this guy's getting the oh we only have
one
grub are these are first grubs no
they're second ones aren't
they
oh no the minions I was trying to go for
the uh the minions and I just dodged the
vex vex Al on
accident let me Farm
bro
okay that's that's totally my
fa I'm dead I think I'm dead
no wait
aite she you know what that's fine she
was zero and three this resets her gold
it's an investment what really sucks is
if I would have just got one more minion
I would have have this but I don't have
it and I don't want to wait for
50
no fear I'm telling you once we get this
item we're going to snowball out of
control I'll just get him aiz
too I might be able to just all in her I
think I can 100 to zero
her she's probably going to
base we'll go kill someone
else like the Teemo with the
bounty
I'm just not expecting this Vex to just
like straight up run me down every time
she's in lame it's it's not going to
work for long though it's a
pretty pretty bad habit to have because
if he can just Land one
knockup of course he's as slow as a
turtle had more than an hour to go time
no way that was on
him
he kind of tanky okay of course I get
ignited you're not getting back to your
turret
buddy I'm on a ward X is a dragon though
want see a
trick I got
him yep Fizz is balanced you're
welcome nice
spe alls well ands well all right we're
going to go Lich Bane next that just
gives me so much more burst and since we
have ingenious Hunter it's going to
lower the cool down of storm surge L
Bane and then I should go hourglass next
just to abuse the lower coold down on
The Hourglass plus what I can do is
after I burst someone hourglass and then
I can wait for my e in aash yeah you can
Flash in the middle of your e and pull
the damage further wait what are they
low I'm going to lose a cannon for this
no no no
no they are not low
enough I mean we could fight this if
somebody else goes in I'll clean up I
can't go in first though an
ally they're probably dead before I even
get there I
know well I don't know how much gold I
got there but yeah look at that th gold
didn't I just come back to Lane with
like
nothing I get extra
30 and then I get extra what 20 from
Triumph so that's extra 50 gold on kills
I'm
getting they won't catch
me well look at
you
seriously which that's almost an extra
that's like an extra 18% gold on kill
which is kind of crazy or do kills give
300 or
350 I don't even
know
well let's throw up again he's leaving I
mean he's going to have shrooms I'm
going to need a
[Music]
sweeper if I had ignite I knew I know I
can kill her full
HP might be able to get
her yeah I got
her dude look at that like and this is a
champion that's supposed to be good
against me because of her anti-h extra
damage but that that goes out the window
now that she died before she can even
hit me
back storm
surge thanks for the extra 50 gold
too I don't know if I got the extra 50
gold
there come on let's
go I mean if I combo right there's
nothing she can do because I'm landing
my e right after the shark that hits so
she has no time
there's no time to fear me before she
takes all of her
HP want to see a
trick what actually counters Fizz um not
too
much maybe like a Pantheon's decent
Vladimir can pull his shark but fiz can
still do a lot of damage to a
[Music]
Vladimir
turn yeah cuz
gragas is decent
Leandra an
ally now we need to kill botlan who do I
need heam wait I need jungler I already
killed the botan I just
remember go find him I think Vex is
following me
though
oh this guy's dead dude he he died
before I could even qw him like he's
just
dead my storm surch has like a 20 second
cool down now instead of a
30 like I'm telling you Fizz is not fair
Ally has been
SL and the thing that's sucks is they're
going to Nerf these item like this
item's already been nerfed three times
by the way it's still
broken it sucks cuz the items are going
to get nerfed too hard so that they're
not strong on Fizz and stuff fizz and
Echo Diana whatever but if they're not
strong on them then they're going to be
absolutely useless on like Mages that
want to use them so like the problem is
these kind of Champs ruin the AP items
for the
rest let's
do
I get The Hourglass I don't know in
aash that's the only balancing issue
there is is that assassins then abuse
Bruiser
items ruin it for
bruisers and assassins also abuse Mage
items which ruins it for
Mages let's go fishing I caught a
horse and the thing is like I'm fed yes
but it wasn't hard to get to where I'm
at like every time I see a Fizz in a
game this happens like this not because
I'm getting like stupid fed diock it's
like champ is stupid an En X might kill
them no
fear and that's not even a lethality H
that H has a extra 500 HP in his items
already and he just got one shot swiming
I probably need my ALT to oneshot him
but if I burst him here I could probably
do enough to make him run away and not
fight
me where is
Vex okay Vex you got to chill with
poking me cuz like I'm not going to take
that for much
longer all right
well I'm dead but you're dead
too
he don't even want
me I guess he didn't have all I don't
know what happened oh they're looking
for
me I might die soon so I don't know if
I'm going to buy
that Daren I want the large Rod but I
also want this I'll just buy this YOLO
cuz if I buy this I can use this and
then up upgrade an hourglass and then
stopwatch twice a row or not yes there's
no stopwatch no more hourglass twice in
a row in two
fights ready yeah Gallia would do decent
versus Fizz anybody that can survive
fizz's
burst without dying and then CC
him
whatever it's just like use your spells
on the wave I I'm just going to do
that I'm just going to kill
you oh he's fighting I didn't even
see where they
at oh hey you're dead
too oh
yeah
waiting for my w he's going to flash the
wall or
something wait what did I kill him with
my w and Q didn't even hit but I think I
got a regular Auto
off oh yeah this game looks like it just
went from Lane phase to over just like
that well maybe not if he gets Horseman
gets some kills has SL which Horseman is
going to give me some gold now thank you
very much ahead of
it's just like what were they
thinking I just think I can burst Teo if
I don't kill him I'm dead
because I don't have any Mana to use
more spells now I can't even kill him if
I wanted an enemy has been
slain an enemy has been slain
um well I have a lot of money
so I'll just buy this hold this they
won't catch me buy
this and GG I'm going to play another
one we're going to do two Fizz games cuz
they're going to go quick I'm telling
you once I get storm surge it's GG game
over there
