Long ago
before the ruination ended their line.
The Royal Family of Camavor
revered Imperial dragons
as powerful and majestic creatures.
So as one of the few Imperial dragons
still alive today, 
Smolder is kind of a big deal.
Or he will be at least as soon as he
masters flying, and breathing fire,
and being big, and scary. You know, dragon stuff.
Smolder: "Sizzle!"
The fiery fledgling is an ADC
who's all about scaling.
He may seem like a tiny spark at first,
but he can grow into a late game inferno.
So you ready to play with fire?
Welcome to the Smolder Champion Spotlight.
Smolder: "Go Smolder! Go Smolder!"
Smolder’s passive is "Dragon Practice".
Whenever he hits a champion
with an ability
or kills a target with Q,
he learns a bit more about Dragoning
and gains a stack.
Each stack increases
the damage of his basic abilities,
making them extra spicy
as he gets more practice.
This means Smolder gets stronger
and stronger as the game goes on,
so let him cook.
Q is Smolder's "Super Scorcher Breath".
He spits the biggest, awesomest fireball
he can muster at his target.
Okay, maybe it's not that impressive yet,
but you just wait.
[Draven laughs]
Smolder: "You started it!"
As Smolder gains
more stacks of his passive,
he enhances super scorcher
breath in three tiers.
At Tier 1,
it deals AOE damage around the target.
At Tier 2, more explosions
shoot off behind the initial fireball.
And at Tier 3, the flame burns targets
for additional true damage
over a few seconds.
If they drop below a certain health
threshold in that time, they're toast.
Don't forget that Smolder gains stacks
whenever he hits enemy champs
with abilities, or kills unit with Q.
Focus on last hitting
and poking opponents with Q,
so he reaches those stack tiers
as quickly as possible.
By the time late game rolls around,
he'll be a teamfight
terror with tons of AoE damage.
Breathing fire
isn't without its challenges, though.
Like all that soot in your nose.
With W smolder sneezes out a fiery glob
this blast damages and
briefly slows targets and explodes
around any champions in the line of fire.
And you thought your allergies were bad
[Smolder laughing]
During laning phase,
"Achooo!" is a crucial farming tool
for Smolder.
He can use it to soften up a wave
and last it with Q for all the stacks.
In teamfights,
it's a powerful AoE spell,
hitting multiple champions
sets up explosions
around each one, which scale
with his passive and ability rank.
That late game
damage is nothing to sneeze at.
Don't you just love his little wings?
Well, they aren't just for princely charm.
Smolder's E, "FLAP, FLAP, FLAP",
sends him into the air for a short duration
where he ignores
terrain and gains, moves speed and vision.
He'll bombard the closest enemy in range
with bursts of flame.
Prioritizing the lowest health champion.
Smolder’s E can help him
catch fleeing enemies and secure kills,
but it's also his only escape tool.
So fly with caution
or you may crash and burn.
Smolder: "What did I do?"
Behind every adorable baby dragon
is a super protective mama dragon.
Smolder’s ult summons "MMOOOMMMM!" to teach a lesson
to any meanies picking on her son,
a face melting, scorched earth
kind of lesson.
After casting,
Smolder’s mom flies overhead, breathing
down a wave of fire
and burning enemies to a crisp.
Targets caught in the center
take extra damage and are slowed.
The wave starts a little bit behind
Smolder’s position
and continues over a long distance.
Anyone who might be hit by the flames
will hear Mom's roar as a warning,
so best run for cover if you can.
Nothing burns quite like a mother's love.
While the spell can help
smolder disengage if he's in a bad spot,
his mom is best at starting fires.
I mean, fights, especially
if the enemy team is grouped up.
Slow them down with a center of Smolder’s ult,
then go full blast with the rest
of his AoE damage.
Smolders Dragon Practice stacks are the fuel for turning
this glowing ember into a roaring blaze.
He needs to farm safely in the early game
to stack his passes and improve his Q
before he's ready to take on the world.
That means he'll need a more lane
dominant support looking out for him
while he grows big and strong.
Champions who can zone opponents off
will make great lane partners
for his widdle kiddo.
On the other hand, he may struggle
against lane bullies who can force him
to retreat and lose out on stacks.
Without much Dragon Practice,
his ability to trade is limited,
so enemies with lots of poke
and engage tools are blistering
counter picks against Smolder.
Where he really burns
brightest is teamfighting.
Thanks to his powerful
AoE damage, roasting grouped up enemies
is his specialty, but like most ADCs,
he needs to position wisely
to stay safe. Fly in solo,
and you might just fizzle out.
Smolder is designed to be a simpler marksman
with an approachable kit.
So if you've been looking for a reason
to learn ADC, who burns hotter than 80ºC,
consider this a warm invitation
to try the Fiery Fledgling.
Likewise, if you enjoy marching with
their own escape tools like Ezreal or Zeri,
or adorable forces of destruction
like Tristana and Kog’Maw,
you may want to take smolder
for a test flight.
And of course, if you love getting stacks
on stacks on stacks, looking at you,
Veigar and Nasus fans,
then the scaling damage should be
just what you're looking for.
Phew, is it toasty in here or just me?
I got to go cool off.
