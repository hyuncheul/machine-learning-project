need
[Music]
of today is a good day to
die stand with me me brothers and
[Music]
sisters
dares for my
[Music]
father needs to be careful once again
you can see Violet trying to get into
there did he get in the vision there I'm
not too sure whether he was spotted I'm
guessing judging by wicked's movement I
don't think he was now he's going to go
in there and again the to and stuns him
on the turet there and here comes the
ultimate coming out from carus is it
going to be enough oh Wicked diving
straight on that one they can see the AP
coming on can he go to Violet I don't
think he's going be to track it down
Wicked playing that one absolutely
superb the teamwork involv that's going
to be the ultimate coming out from is it
up toys and Sur going to get dropped
he's down to an egg right now Templar is
getting dived on the damage really
coming from the wo at the back Stanley
Stanley gets one Stanley gets two b gets
another one that's going to be the C he
this one he gets the quarter kill he
gets the quarter kill surprise surprise
I didn't have to go support for some
apparent reason there was a Leona and a
twitch that wanted to go to the bottom
so I thought fine I can play my n after
a long time ago so I do hope this game
will be quite good though I must say I'm
facing going for it of course he did use
his shadow so in a way if I land the
perfect spear oh no you oh to attack him
will the red buff be enough no he
probably used the pose H Heim you should
have continued mate but at least he has
been forced out of the lane which is
good I like it but I'm going to fail
this jump first if you don't mind oh I
actually succeeded immediately it's okay
I'm going to tank it the red buff might
take it true a spear just to be certain
back I think to channel Yu to get the
better the perfect alt together was
Fiora she's just more of a whole pagy
she just you know she does everything
right there you don't have to have no
Whirlwind or anything so we'll see teo's
going to be a bit annoying because
obviously the effective he can just Auto
take me down and run away like he did
then he used his obviously used his W to
run away
so but he's actually
um overextended now so there was my
double Q which I could have done before
realized he would have I thought they
would have been able to have handled it
a bit
better my screen went
crazy my ulate still up
so that's cool about
now AG let me see can I pop
it another unworthy
opponent
there we
go I don't know what he's doing
here to try hard I would be invading the
crap out of this guy right now honestly
I'll just be walking up to him making
his life miserable and one of the
reasons why these maze jungles aren't
very good is because or off meta jungles
in general I guess one of the reasons
why they're not very good is because if
you come up against someone who can beat
you and
honestly too many shrooms and not a
healthy Darius but we can try you know
we can try something
here
nice look at that
perfect he tried the cheeky old fade
away be glorious I don't know who it's
going to be but it's going to be someone
I'm going to [ __ ] him up you know what
let's get this dick out
here all right we'll take that and that
well you can have that then never mind
let pop the potions here where you're
running Nami you going to come back this
way no you're not maybe I can get you
around here Nami Maybe I can get you
out my Journey's only
[Music]
beginning an ally has been
slain
my place is at the
top point w all right oh he missed he
missed you're dead

that it wouldn't have been First Blood
anyways whatever okay let's uh let's go
over here now like I'm on my
way get him dude what are you doing come
on doe your six you're six you're six
come
on that was a great ult I think he's
going to get the
kill nice dude uh-oh oh fail play Fail
play all right A Auto
again and they got up there okay I guess
we should be worried about that I'm
coming I'm coming this is really good
that he's distracting them I'm I'm I'm
predicting a triple kill for
me mod does it stack twice as fast it
does an aam I think but here I'm not
