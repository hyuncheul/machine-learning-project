five reasons why crouching is good and
valerant when they know where you're
coming from you're going to walk right
into their Crosshair Crouch so their
first bullets land above your
head when they've already managed to
shoot a couple of bullets at you crouch
to make them whiff the next
ones once you get AIM punched the only
way for you to recover is by crouching
and continuing to shoot Crouch spam when
they're low HP and you'll win the fight
by the time they aim at your
head the Crouch Peak works every time
because you throw their aim off and
you're harder to hit
