oh
[Music]
one man the focus of attention well
Derek we know he loves linking up with
other players but it's when he's in and
around the penalty area that's when he's
at his most dangerous when he plays
little one tws around his marker and
then plays the next forward pass into a
run and hello to you from City that's
never short of style I'm talking of
course about the French Capital Paris
we're at the P de pass I'm Derek Ray
getting ready to bring you all the
action accompanied by my broadcasting
partner Stuart Robson and with the title
perhaps slipping away a venicius oh
blocked
[Applause]
it
marinos and the PSG team looks like this
Jan Luigi donaruma begins in goal Lucas
Hernandez plays with ashf ke in the
fullback positions vtor fera starts
alongside kangin Lee in central Midfield
and handed the task of playing up front
today is kilan mbappe chance to finish
and the opportunity goes a begging he
decided to hit that with power rather
than going for
placement over the touch line for
what'll be a PSG
throw well considering the form book
Stuart kilan mbappe has got to be taken
seriously here Defenders Derek hate
playing against players with pace and
he's got plenty of pace to run in behind
and he does it cleverly he comes short
then spins him behind and then he's One
V one against the goalkeeper and he
usually finishes it
[Applause]
off read it well
federo
Valverde and Ra's creative Tendencies
coming to the
four chance to put them in
front Modric and the post denied him
well it looked as though it might be
problematic for the keeper and the
Defenders but they've got away with it
well he eventually clutches the ball but
they've got lucky here that really
looked like being a goal didn't
[Applause]
it oh great
vision
modri and on to Bellingham well just
fractionally wide good
strike oh judgment error by The
Keeper spot on with that tackle
so plenty of forward momentum from Real
Madrid
here look at Modric
modri Manuel
[Applause]
Ugarte Danilo
Pereira
hakeim
[Applause]
fera head
mow Mandy has
[Applause]
It Real Madrid have certainly had all
the possession over the last 15 minutes
and they're playing really well and
creating chances it's surely only a
matter of time before they take the lead
here
and the challenge halts them in their
[Applause]
tracks
rudiger attacking possibilities for
real V
nus
[Applause]
Hernandez PSG a little wasteful in
possession plenty of support here oh
that's a fight can he put them in front
and stopped there by
marinos demell
he read the situation defensively and
did his
job Venus
J it is a decent looking attack here a
glorious chance a goal oh dear oh dear
how significant could that be in
deciding who takes the title well that's
a massive blow for them they need to go
quickly
here Rodrigo the ball with Luca Modric
and possession lost by Real
Madrid fera and PSG pushing forward with
options
available excellent ball towards the
front
post well couldn't quite find his
teammate aelan
Chui
and now
Rodrigo
Carvajal really good buildup but no end
product kangin
Lee kangin
Lee and players waiting on the center
half-hearted
clearance but it looked so threatening
but the danger
averted Rodrigo the referee has given
the advantage to Real Madrid and space
to
attack this could level it and a goal
Bingo it could happen for them today and
what a crucial goal that could be in the
title race they need to keep pushing
though they do need
another so the whistle then we're up the
halfway stage in this match
[Music]
well underway once more and it's going
to be fascinating to see what
developments occur in this second
half and quick thinking
[Applause]
defensively
and Modric carries it forward let's see
what he does
next
modri gives it a go oh that's textbook
[Applause]
goalkeeping corner kick played in and
the danger is averted pressing like that
will help the
[Applause]
cause meni
now with
Rodrigo and a chance for the
lead and in it goes we can't say yet for
sure but it could be a title winning
goal no wonder they're celebrated can
they hold their nerve
now he's using his strength to good
effect room to roam for PSG on the
wing
and the challenge crisp and
[Applause]
clean
meny now ad
minow holding on to what they have is
the priority
apparently now a decent position genuine
chance and that a piece of goalkeeping
you're going to see again and again and
again playing it in
the well to clear it
[Applause]
away and winning it
back vus and that was goalkeeping right
out of the top draw it's absolutely
remarkable his reflexes were brilliant
there oh a very fine header but it
wouldn't go in for him
30 minutes left for
play and it might be and the keeper more
than equal to
[Applause]
it good use of advantage in favor of
PSG mbappe now what can Paris San jaman
do from this position well nothing comes
of it it looked
promising and PSG showing good WID
here and a throw in it's going to
be demell aimed towards
mbappe he succeeds in clearing
it
[Applause]
Orelia
Chui counterattacking very much an
option
[Applause]
venicius and Real Madrid have it back

outdone himself with that
[Applause]
save played
over aware of the threat solving the
[Applause]
problem intercepted
effortlessly
Mandy now ader

Bellingham real chance oh a good diving
save
[Applause]
another successful intervention winning
the ball
back and one minute of stoppage time has
been added on and it will be a free kick
to Real
Madrid but a fraction wide but he
planted the seed of fear in the mind of
the keeper I think well that was an
excellent strike so close to been a
really Top Class free kick and that is
it a hard result for them to digest and
with that their title
hopes well this is special for everybody

young player and this is what you dream
