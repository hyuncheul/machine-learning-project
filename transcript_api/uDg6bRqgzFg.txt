all eyes on one man well for me Derek
his greatest attribute is his ability to
combine with teammates particularly
entire areas in and around the Box
clever little onew's little passes
around the corner he's the player that
could be key to breaking down this
[Applause]
defense stay tuned it's
live
one of the great things about football
is that no one knows for sure what's
going to happen let's see what unfolds
here tonight my name is Derek Ray and
ready with his tactics board to provide
all the analysis is Stuart Robson and on
the menu today club's match action for
you to enjoy Stuart tell us about your
pre-match thoughts well Derek we can
talk about coaches and their methods but
it's now down to the players which ones
might still be able to do a better
damage and the Keeper's technical skills
there for all to see well from that
close in that's a really good save such
good
[Applause]
reflexes and there to
intervene
and Arnold Has It Now options are
plenty and credit is due for that good
piece of
Defending promising
[Applause]
pass just the tackle that was
needed and that is going to be a free
kick
[Applause]
now possibilities in the
[Applause]
center just the clearance that was
called
for in a decent position now
can he convert and a goal an early boost
for them the first goal of the game
they're off and
running well just look at this he keeps
his composure and he almost passes it
into the back of the net that's a very
good
[Applause]
goal so underway again here one n the
score and room now out on the wing
[Applause]
Arnold wasteful from big
trouble and the referee blows for a
[Applause]
foul
[Applause]
good cross it in
here that's a useful cross able to deal
with the
threat oh and a perfect ball now how
about this but mistimed his run well
he's got the timing all wrong there he
just needs to bite
time and big trouble have possession
again oh nice ball over the top and a
goal it is they lead by two now fully
deserves well I have to say this is a
really good goal just watch his
technique here he just hits through the
back of the ball with such power there's
no stopping
that so underway again and a two
Advantage
here
[Applause]
herio oh fine play and maybe it'll set
something
[Applause]
up textbook defending Inside the
[Applause]
Box
good
pass took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
them well they know they need to stop
him
oh
jeno just not looking it around looking
to carve out a
[Applause]
chance
Crow
oh high quality
[Applause]
defending
[Applause]
jenu and big trouble might be able to
profit
[Applause]
here can he finish he's blocked
it and over it comes
just knocked it out of
[Music]
there he's given it
away over the touch line for a throw
[Applause]
in the cross is on
oh it comes to nothing in the end really
should have made more of
[Applause]
[Applause]
that can they create something from here
and whipped into the box but keeper ball
they'll be disappointed with that
delivery so nearing the break here and
it's not going to plan at all for the
visitors we have to be honest Stuart
your thoughts oh big chance here Derek
and a goal Here There It Is they've done
it so the action underway once more with
big trouble very much on top in this
one good looking move oh great
defending
[Applause]
if you're wondering about stoppage time
one minute to be added
on oh great
vision and there it is the halim
whistle
[Applause]
see
well big trouble very much bossing the
game up to now will there be a response
in the second
[Applause]
45
[Applause]
the referee allowing advantage to acrw
to
[Applause]
them and the referee sensibly allowing
them to carry on Advantage with
them
hotelli oh dangerous looking through
ball well he gave it real leather but
miles off
[Applause]
Target and well positioned to
clear
ESO and that's very good referee aging
to let the play Flow well the advantage
wasn't helping them and so now they get
the free
[Applause]
kick good looking
cross and nothing comes of
it
nicely timed
tackle what was the chance they could
get caught out on the break
[Applause]
here and there it breaks down but credit
to the
defense well very effective play in
possession and swiftly ending that
attack
[Applause]
determined
[Applause]
defending
oh so a throw in
here
[Applause]
[Applause]
like a really smart piece of Defending
to stop
[Applause]
them
Arnold and quick thinking
[Applause]
defensively racing forward trying to
catch them
out and just like that the Counterattack
comes to an
end
[Applause]
Cho and in the right position to make
sure it didn't go all the way
[Applause]
through J oh danger here still can be
dangerous and it's two for him today a
masterful performance The Defenders
unable to stop
it well just look at his movement he
knows exactly how to find space and it's
also a tidy finish that's a nice
goal well couldn't keep
[Applause]
it Now options are
plenty
Jong
Mooney showing good defensive judgment
and good use of Advantage the referee
allowing play to
[Applause]
continue
Crow but he needs to be careful here and
the referee blows for a
[Applause]
foul
oh he'll be delighted to have won the
ball having made that oh genuine chance
and a goal he's doubled as total for the
day in superb scoring
form my goodness it's so one decided 5
nil in this
[Applause]
match feeding it
[Applause]
through magnificent challenge to win it
back now maybe room here for the
Counterattack
[Applause]
spot on with that
[Applause]
tackle this look promising out
[Applause]
wide well that's how to keep the
opposition at
[Applause]
Bay and so to the final 5
minutes a goal how about that he's put
it away to make it a
hattick well here it is again and it's
all about the pacing transition they're
so quick to get out from the back and
then the shot could not be hit any
better struck with such V great
goal
[Applause]
ESO
that is a very fine challenge in
difficult
circumstances plenty of supports
here oh good defending to stop a decent
looking attack now can they counter
clinically well they seem to be on to
something positive but it faded away and
that will be all for this game anyway
and defeat for the visitors
was even worse they never got to grips
through the opposition they were second
best in every facet of the game they
need to do a lot of improving before the
next time
[Applause]
out
stand
they fought long and hard and now it
comes down to this the equation is
simple win the game and win promotion
can they do it with the pressure

interception
Jong an effective

[Applause]
teammate well they couldn't take
advantage of the
[Music]

a really single-minded piece of
Defending to make sure nothing unto
happened getting

kick

each other whatever you can do I can do
just as
[Applause]
well
well High marks for that
[Applause]
pass oh great
defending and she made that look
[Applause]
simple passing it around looking for the
goal that would put them
ahead and the defensive intervention
[Applause]
there well that s to put in a
[Music]
tackle onto Yang pressing high and they
have the ball
again oh nice ball over the top real
chance was an important piece of
Defending well just listen to these fans
they're urging their team to score here
and take the
lead and over comes the quter not the
most confident
[Applause]
clearance must take the lead here what a
vital
intervention well they couldn't keep

[Applause]
rewarded it's a perfect
challenge
Ramos

ring
Bale
Divo here's Ramos well it's a decent
looking attack this since they have the
ball the referee playing Advantage here
sound piece of
goalkeeping
promising
pass now let's see about the cross and
the danger is
averted 20 minutes to go in this
one a very good
tackle
good through
[Applause]
ball well they win the throw following
that
challenge well the hosts as you can see
have enjoyed so much possession but
their attacking players been too slow
mainly due to a lack of movement of the
front players at some point they have to
threaten the space in behind the
Defenders otherwise they're going to
lose this chance for him to get in
behind
maybe able to get his body in the way
over the touch line for a throw
[Applause]
in successfully cut
out teammates available a good Vision
there here's Yang smuggled
away
well the fans are certainly playing
their part here just listen to this
noise oh nice ball over the top to
[Applause]
Chase and a very good
challenge well no time to waste can they
find an equalizer this could level it
and all square now and you have to ask
the question is the time for either side
to win
it well here's the replay and just look
how quickly they F forward once they win
the ball back while the move in the fox
is equal to it such good timing what a
goal using space on the opposite flank
now oh nice
ball wow really fine goalkeeping good
diving
[Applause]
stop they couldn't maintain
possession and a goal at this stage
could be
decisive cutting the ball
back oh did so well to deny
him
and in the right position to make sure
it didn't go all the way
through
Bale here's
[Applause]
Yang and ring in
possession and players waiting on the
center well that's good defending well
organized at the
back and the final whistle at the end of
the game the two sides cannot be
separated
I
that's
the prize today is considerable win the
game and make it through to the
promotion match a big test of every
player's
character
[Applause]

analysis on alongside me is Stuart

they can qualify for a promotion match
Stuart your expectations well Derek it's
certainly in their hands if they win
here a promotion match will be theirs
they just need to put in a good
performance it won't be easy
[Applause]
though going well
Crossing
opportunity Al overa did that pass and
he knows
it and out of play the pass nearly
worked out but not
quite
herel
[Applause]
and taken
[Applause]
short
[Applause]
etto
Jong
oh they've lost
it
D can they create something from
here he got in the way of that
cross a very good
tackle
and cutting it
out this is looking
threatening
and he takes it on oh good work by The
[Applause]
Keeper over it comes well somehow the
goalkeeper got to
[Music]
it oh great header Smart Stop though
growing pressure here and another
Corner delivering
it oh the crossbar is still
reverberating well you've got to say
comfortably off Target Stuart yeah
that's a waste of good possession his
teammates are not happy with him and
they're letting him
knowto not smooth in
[Applause]
possession and a good looking ball and a
No Nonsense
clearance a really single-minded piece
of Defending to make sure nothing un to
happened released it nicely oh a golden
opportunity for her and it's in one n
they' breached the
[Applause]
defense
[Applause]
and back on theway one n it
is
Jong the textbook
[Applause]
interception and a tidy ball realizing
that it might be opening up on the
opposite
flank oh might be and still danger here
but hang on the flag is up and the
keeper can breathe a big sigh of
relief tremendous intuition to win it
back delivered into the
box just wanted to get it out of
there this might be the perfect
counterattacking
opportunity and take it
[Applause]
away
Baba well they have it
again
do short attempted oh he couldn't outwit
the
[Applause]
keeper trying to pick out a teammate not
quite the clearance they were hoping
for might work
[Applause]
out really good ball
there Splendid
[Applause]
defending and the emphasis is on
creativity
good
distribution and a strong
[Applause]
tackle he could pick out a
teammate
good ball over the
[Applause]
top the first half here comes to an
[Applause]
end
let
see
away they go again second half is
underway
here lot to like about that pass crossed
accurately towards the far post she
needs to get it out of there well a
corner kick it is let's see if they can
put this to good use as they try to add
to their
advantage could be and a really good
diving stop smuggled behind for another
Corner who's going to get on the end of
it R oh touched on to the
woodwork well they might be able to
launch a
Counterattack and they'll regard that as
a very disappointing end to the
[Applause]
move
he's given it
away now who can she pass it to oh
thwarted there and what a piece of
Defending we've just
witnessed wilting under the pressure and
now they try to go forward what a
genuine opportunity but it was
squandered k
kick
etto that is how to apply the
[Applause]
pressure retaining possession proving
difficult
D well as you can see the visitors have
controlled the possession in the last 15
minutes and have been pressing to extend
their lead they just need to be a bit
more clinical in front of go
yes who knows maybe another opportunity
in the works for them and the referee
says
penalty well he's avoided a booking but
the complaints continue and I can
understand why I think it's a poor foul
it should be a yellow card for me and in
it goes as cly as you like never on any
doubt from the
spot well here we see it again the
keeper tries to read penalty but in the
end she just makes no effort
whatsoever so underway once more 2-n the
lead
here
herö happyday to the football player je
happy birthday from all your friends
and 30 minutes left for
play a good Vision
there might be able to set up the
chance
and still pressing well he stumped it
out of there without much
fuss well these fans can sense an
opportunity here they need to make the
most of this
[Applause]
corner and there's the delivery not
getting a strong fist on the
ball that's a very fine piece of
tackling can he get one
back
oh a superb
save oh what a top doch
[Applause]
pass oh a tremendous
block might be a chance to
break defensive Brazilians to shut them
down oh yes what a pass PO is loose and
there it is an almost intuitive piece of
finishing so on with the match 21 is the
score line what's going to happen
next fine cross into the middle
and reading it absolutely
[Music]
superbly
[Applause]
[Music]
ETO really incisive
defending and this situation could be
dangerous and a goal to really bolster
things for them two in front
[Applause]
so they get the ball moving again 3-1
the score line here what's going to
happen
[Applause]
next
ESO very alert defending to put a stop
to the chance well maybe a good position
from which to
counter as eyes for goal and the the
keeper more than equal to the
[Applause]
task he's driven in the corner and the
goalkeeper's touch that was crucial
Corner once
[Applause]
more I couldn't really direct it where
he
wanted
and he was in the right place to
intercept what a genuine opportunity but
it was squandered go
[Applause]
kick in a decent position now good idea
and there it is that will put the seal
on Victor if there were any lingering
[Applause]
doubts
ESO a lot of space to
[Applause]
attack teammates in the middle not quite
the clearance they were hoping
for it was a menacing attack but tied
up
but it comes down to the final 5
minutes that's a high quality pass well
going for the chip and might now be
wishing she hadn't well if she could
she'd have that one back again it's a
poor effort
[Applause]
really constant to the Penalty area and
it goes but it will not stand offside
Stewart well it looked close didn't it
he certainly thought so he's making that
clear to the linesman
[Applause]
now showing good defensive
[Applause]
judgment we will have 3 minutes of
additional time at the end
[Applause]
here
good distribution a wonderful
intervention
[Applause]
heril and there goes the final whistle
it's gone the wrong way as far as the
home
fans
