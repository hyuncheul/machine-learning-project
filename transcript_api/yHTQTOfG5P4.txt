I think I found your bear
oh I'm not playing with you
ashes ashes you fall down
playtime is going to get a little rocky
Mages are infants grasping at the
machine
have a plausible excuse
idiocy is often mistaken for innocence
mother gave me bear as child to Annie
they say I was once your age
though I can't quite recall
the kind of monster would kill a child
oh right
now you're really playing with fire
little girl
oh a little girl there's got to be a
twist it's the teddy bear isn't it
damn me
don't let go
run along child this Tome is not a
bedtime story
