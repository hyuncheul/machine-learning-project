let's see what happens
next Sasha
lukic illegal play and hence a free
kick Sasha
lukic well what a stop that
was and No Nonsense defensive
clearance now perhaps they can counter
from here and he's in
[Applause]
it's got to be and you've got to credit
that magnificent piece of Defending and
there it is two goals in a matter of
minutes incredible
[Applause]
[Applause]
stuff so back underway with the lead
standing at
[Applause]
2-n
[Applause]
Wilson Thiago mes determined defending
and the Counterattack is on options
available Harvey
Barnes really fine piece of Defending
play to break us
up well let's have a look at the table
and still very tight near the summit
both managers know today could be
crucial for their title hopes and Stuart
no margin for error absolutely not this
is a massive game for both teams so I'm
expecting a really tough battle today
between two very good sides let's just
hope it's not too C oh Stuart they've
got to score and both hands on it good
goalkeeping
Wilson
well shielding the ball
admirably dieago
Mor beautifully weighted
ball well they couldn't do anything
positive with the
cross oh good vision and they could do
damage and it's a double for him in this
game no way for the opposition to
contain him and no wonder he's off
celebr
so back underway and Liverpool really
Galloping to Victory
now and passing it through but a
intercepted when it looked as though
they might be
[Applause]
in Now options are
plenty but timely defending when it
mattered well he's featured on the back
pages of quite a few newspapers in
recent days the rumors are true he's
going to end his wonderful career at the
end of the season and what a loss for
the club that is bound to be Stuart well
it's slightly surprising because he
still looks a very good player but he
obviously knows his own body and thinks
he can't perform at his best anymore I
think he's made a brave
[Applause]
decision and Under Pressure that was a
fine claim
[Applause]
Salah oh good strike well that's really
sound goalkeeping not letting the
opposition have any
scraps they will now make use of their
substitutes
bench and a goal a significant
deflection and no wonder the goalkeeper
is looking up at the sky in disbelief
well there it is quite clearly it takes
a deflection and that's enough to beat
the keeper not much he could do
[Applause]
there blistering first half display and
just look at that
[Applause]
score ad
[Applause]
dama and unable to keep
possession well there is going to be
stoppage time but only the one
minute and with
that so back in business and it was a
breathtaking performance by Liverpool in
the first 45 you've got to
[Applause]
say
[Applause]
Wilson and fine work from Liverpool to
win the ball
[Applause]
back well a swift Challenge and a throw
in coming
[Applause]
up well this is the home of live
football eatv and we have more action
coming up from the Premier League for
you it's fham versus Len
toown shaping to shoot wonderful
block that'll be a Liverpool
balling off the pitch and they're making
a
change well no way through racing
forward triy to catch them
[Applause]
out but really sticking to their task
defensively
[Applause]
can he find the right
[Applause]
pass
Alexander
Arnold
Salah well nothing comes of the attack
when all is said and
[Applause]
done well make sure you join us for more
Premier League action coming your way
it's Liverpool facing
[Applause]
wolves happy to take on the
shot
Liverpool Corner
given and over it
comes oh yes a goal exactly what they
were looking for and he's come up with
it well here it is again it's a good
delivery from the corner and it ends up
with a fairly simple finish certainly
not much the goalkeeper can do about
[Applause]
that my goodness it's so one-sided 5 nil
in this
[Applause]
match
Adama well the pass not finding its
[Applause]
Target furuhashi and on the ball KY he's
in
behind oh great goalkeeping well that's
a top quality save great
anticipation trying to pick out a
teammate oh the crossbar is still
reverberating mopping up
defensively and into the last 15 minutes
of
[Applause]
action Tim re
on to
Wilson really good
[Applause]
interception and a clear foul but the
referee letting the play
Flow and a good challenge to bring that
attack to an
end
Wilson delivering it into the box and
overcame the ball from the flank but
dealt with in the
end went in strongly
decisively
furuhashi Wilson
Salah what about the stoppage time
situation 2 minutes the
[Applause]
word
Wilson he read the situation defensively
and did his
job the sound of the referee's whistle
this
match
just a couple of questions for
[Music]
you thank you
for
[Music]
girl I already
cash thank you all for your patience
we're going to start taking questions
[Music]
now
[Music]
against lose
no doubt about it the fans are on tenter
hooks ahead of this one they know full
well that the heroes could today clinch
the league title will they do it anfield
one of the most storied venues anywhere
in the football world I'm Derek Ray and
my commentary partner here on the Gantry
is the former Arsenal and West Ham
player Stuart Robson and today's the day
they could be CR Champions it is
Liverpool versus wolver Hampton
Wanderers well what a game this promises
to be speaking to the fans outside the
stadium they're in buoyant mood full of
expectation that they'll be celebrating
come the final whistle oh big
chance oh just the start they were
hoping for as it stands they will be
Champions well they're playing with
great intensity and they've got their
reward what a start for
[Applause]
them
so the action continues and it's on
walles to show invention and perhaps
level the
game Joel
[Applause]
Felman and he read it well
[Applause]
defensively and Liverpool might be able
to cash in
and the goalkeeper covered a lot of
ground to push that away from
[Applause]
danger
kaiit well we're at the business end of
the season now and when you look at the
top of the table still unclear who's
going to take the title one thing you
can guarantee though is you can watch it
all unfold live here on eatv Well you
certainly know who pays your wages Derek
but I think everybody can see this is
going to be a great finale to the season
which team will keep grinding out the
results it's going to be very
exciting now they stopped them in their
tracks feing it
through well it might still work out for
[Applause]
them well it comes to nothing in the
end right I believe something has
changed at the Emirates let's hear all
about it from Alex it's a goal for
Everton it was a low driven cross into a
crowded area but he was there from close
range to finish that move off they're
the first on the score sheet here with
17 minutes played many thanks
Alex well couldn't find a teammate
unfortunately and a throw in to
[Applause]
come well sitting deep here almost
inviting the
pressure very alert defending to cut off
the
supply
Diaz No degree of difficulty at all for
the
[Applause]
keeper Nelson
SoMo and unable to hang on to the ball
that's good pressing for
[Applause]
you
Robertson could cross it in here they
couldn't quite muster a real
threat and G news to bring you from the
Emirates let's join Alex Scott yeah it's
a goal for Arsenal the goalkeeper will
be looking at himself on that one he was
totally out of position and it was an
easy finish the scores level again now
at 1-1 with 32 minutes on the clock
cheers
Alex and in a crowded area the keeper
has managed to get there and he's broken
free firing it towards goal and it goes
a thing of beauty it could be the goal
that puts the exclamation mark on a
title Triumph well the way they're
celebrated they think the title's won
they just need to keep their focus
now well let's look at this again Derek
because the transition when the ball
changes hands is so quick and when he
gets onto it he holds off the challenge
keeps his balance and makes good contact
with the ball that's a the top class
finish so underway again and a 2-n
Advantage
here Sasha
[Applause]
kic it's a good wolves move in the
making chances on and it's in a goal
here that complicates to life a bit with
the title issue far from settled well
just look at the reaction of the coach
he's abs absolutely Furious as it stands
they'll be Champions but they need to
regroup and
quickly and they know they need to stop
him can he make it count and not cleared
away properly and it goes a goal to
change the title push well that wasn't
in the script was it they're going to
have to sort themselves out quickly
here Wang he
Chan
clears it
away well there goes
the and the battle has recommenced here
as
anfield
well the Defenders know they need to get
tighter can't really allow runs like
that Ang go for Salah it comes to
absolutely
[Applause]
nothing well let us point you in the
direction of a very significant occasion
the Europa League final live coverage
coming your way right here on eatv it's
Liverpool taking on by lusen well I
think this would be a really good
contest between two teams who fully
deserve their place in the final I can't
wait for that
one encouraging move from
Liverpool chance to play it
in just cleared away in the nick of time
well maybe a good position from which to
[Applause]
counter
gako it's a neat move and it might be
and in it goes we can't say yet for sure
but it could be a title winning goal no
wonder they're celebrating can they hold
their nerve
now well here it is again and it's a
superbly weighted through ball to break
that defensive line and the movement is
good making for a comfortable finish
it's a really great
goal
[Applause]
all eyes are on the manager what's he
going to do to turn this
[Applause]
[Music]
around
[Music]
well the action underway once more and
no shortage of entertainment
3-2
Chira je rner
Belgard
well there's a living breathing example
of positional sense I'll tell you what
the superstitious amongst the fans won't
want me to say this but they are in
position St Oh Derek can he finish it
here they've only gone and grabed
another one two goals in quick
succession now they have the lead no
wonder they're
celebrating well here it is again and
the pace in which they break for is
devastating it's so hard to defend
against but he still got so much work to
do just look at the strength he shows to
hold off the defender and still get his
shot away that's a really good
finish so the current score line
42 and there's been a goal at the Alx
stadium so let's quickly send it over to
Alex it's a third goal for Manchester
United they've pulled one back and now
Trail by one with 68 minutes played
thanks as always to Alex
Scott
Trent Alexander
[Applause]
Arnold into the final 20 minutes and
he's
in managed to get it out of
[Applause]
there Nelson
SoMo decent looking pass
mosalah chances
on and he's only gone and made it a
hatrick absolutely unplayable today what
a
performance well let's see this again
this is counterattacking football at its
very best but there's still plenty for
him to do under all sorts of pressure
from the defender he's just able to keep
him at Bay and finishes with a plum it's
a great
goal number 11
M Nelson C good example of pressing
without the
ball and go Ed to bring you in the
Brighton game and Alex Scott has the
details it's another goal for Manchester
United it was the free kick that
deflected off the wall and the
goalkeeper had no chance with that one
couldn't grab hold of it was
a an important piece of
Defending Pablo Sarabia
well we're sorry for interrupting you
just then Alex just to confirm
Manchester United did score in that game
and it is quite a one-sided contest 4-1
at the
moment Pedro Netto well there to
intercept Alexander
[Applause]
Arnold wanding about outed time 2
minutes It'll
be and time for the change
[Applause]
now
Chira beautifully weighted
ball
[Applause]
p and the penalty has been given here
and the referee will take his name as
well yeah it was a poor Challenge and
the referee is absolutely right to take
his
name and uper grounds off the keeper it
comes to absolutely nothing and there
goes the final whistle I'll tell you
what for weeks their fans have been
singing we're going to win the league
and that's exactly what they've done
well just look at the players reaction a
mixture of relief Joy a bit of
exhaustion there as well what a great
achievement for this club it is the
ultimate measure of achievement for any
club confirmation of quality over the
course of an entire football season and
well they might celebrate with
[Applause]
gusto and now for the moment of
confirmation the Trophy
presentation well this is what they they
were dreaming off before the game they
come and pick this Trophy up what a
performance from them yes a performance
that has impressed absolutely everyone
and now it comes down to holding that
piece of silverware
aoft the Sweet Taste of
success it has been quite the journey
and it comes to an end in style on the
big stage and now the celebrations can
begin not just the
[Applause]
players hi uh just a couple of questions
for
you thank
you
[Music]
[Music]
Now by
will you need your lch you need a CR to
[Music]
about
[Music]
capture got you
TI
[Music]
capture

finging
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
in you're always on

the this is when things get real in the
Europa League it is time for the finals
and there can be only one winner who's
it going to
[Applause]
be it's Liverpool take on Via lusen and
it's live on
eatv and this is it the majority of fans
are inside the stadium now and the
tension is palpable here ahead of the
UEFA Europa League final my name is
Derek Ray and with me in the commentary
position is of course Stuart Robson it
is Liverpool facing Bayer lusen well
what a night for these two clubs Derek
both will be desperate to win in this
trophy you can just sense the tension
out there can't you I've got a feeling
this would be a great
game and this is how Liverpool start the
game Allison gets the no in goal Andrew
Robertson starts with Trent Alexander
Arnold in the fullback positions and the
idea is to have just the one Striker up
there trying to pose problems for the
[Applause]
opposition The Defenders now you can't
really allow space like
that set the lead here oh he's been
denied and they remain locked together
well that's a good save but really he
should have scored from there that's a
big
chance oh there's the goal there's the
opener how about
that
Salah they really pressing their
opponents could cross it in here in the
right place to cut out the
pass a great attacking
Play It's to the go the goalkeeper doing
what he's paid to do it's a corner
wonderful hiter excellent
goalkeeping increasing the pressure
another corner it
is play over not quite the clearance
they were hoping for and F
goalkeeping the corner conceded what can
they do with this
[Applause]
one oh great header Smart Stop
though
well the counter chance looks very
real this could level it they need to
get bodes
back straight forward for the
keeper asiel
palasio
well read to ease the
[Applause]
pressure Gran
Jacka opportunity can they keep it
out wonderful block and a goal to
increase the Le in this final will they
be St
now and he read it well intercepting
it Liverpool in a position of
Menace oh a vital
[Applause]
interception
[Applause]
and beating the
defender good efforts
here oh that is a goal from long range
he won't so forget absolutely right out
of the top
draw well here it is again and just look
at this it's such good technique It's a
Wonderful strike from that
range
so underway once again and he just send
the momentum May well be with Liverpool
[Applause]
now well that was
inciting about it back
[Music]
to his
teammate no mistake by The
[Applause]
Keeper
[Applause]
palasio now the quick counter attack
could be
on and the electronic board showing one
additional
minute
[Applause]
Salah and so the first half has come to
an end
[Applause]
so the two teams have switched around
and the second half is
underway oh this is looking
promising possibilities Inside the Box a
very good tackle
well quite rightly all roads lead to
Wembley on FA Cup final day and you'll
be able to see the action live with us
right here on eatv it's Liverpool facing
Arsenal well that's always a great
occasion the atmosphere will be elected
and the two teams will be desperate to
lift that
clup the really single-minded piece of
Defending to make sure nothing unto
happened
[Applause]
Salah got away from
[Music]
[Applause]
Jaa big chance oh The Equalizer just
what they needed and their dream remains
very much
alive
well just look how he holds off the
defender he keeps his balance and he
still hits the target what a good goal
that
[Applause]
[Applause]
is
not many size would have the mental
strength to bounce back from adversity
like this
[Applause]
team
rck
[Applause]
Sheik not a classic example of how to
intercept he needs to be careful
here and the Liverpool throw in
forthcoming
substitution then let's see how it
affects the match and defending as a
[Applause]
unit now can they counter
clinically can they use their
Pace ra of the Box oh this and the
goalkeeper touch that was
[Applause]
crucial and play short
[Applause]
and angling it
back oh he saved it well an example of a
goalkeeper in top form
here and a good
[Applause]
tackle that's a good
ball
time and P back oh it's a penalty can
they get themselves in front now to
restore their lead here and it goes he
scored on his debut and his f are loving
that well a dramatic moment near the end
and that might well be the
decid
they could level it a small stop
here but in the accuracy Department
leaving a bit to be
desired Liverpool had it all to do
opportunity it is oh the keeper made it
look routine it was anything
but well he could give it away something
to worry about here looking for a
teammate oh I can't believe it twist and
turns at the closing stages and it's
anyone's guess who's going to lift the
trophy incredible well here's the replay
he's done really well to get his head up
and pick somebody out with that cut back
and the Finish is clinical it just makes
it look so easy doesn't
it
three
and it comes down to the final five
minutes and by lusen still on the attack
as the minutes take away a level contest
danger avert it this might be the
perfect counterattacking
opportunity until they have the gu to
open up the defense oh
[Music]
[Music]
go
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
late drama here and surely that's one
hand on the trophy so little time left
for a response
[Applause]
now has the nature of his
M and he must play with the
[Applause]
cross and now we can say it officially
they have won the UEFA Europa
League well great emotions here Derek
just look at the Joy on these players
faces they've been absolutely brilliant
today such a high level of
competition

[Music]
a wonderful scene here at Wembley and an
ocean of fans descending upon the
stadium for what promises to be an
absolutely riveting FA Cup Final it's
Arsenal they face Liverpool and it's
coming up live on eatv
next at long last the wait is over a
warm welcome to Wembley this is Derek
Ray joined in the commentary Box by
Stuart Robson and we're approaching
kickoff time in what promises to be a
spectacular FA Cup Final it's Arsenal
taking on Liverpool well Derek as a
youngster growing up this was the day
that every young football had rled
playing in the FA Cup Final walking out
in front of the 100,000 fans at Wembley
broadcast around the world it still
brings a tingle to my spine and I'm
really looking forward to this
one it's a good Liverpool move in the
making CR into the penalty area he
brings it down but work to do as though
there might be a threat but not so in
the end good defending he might be
through
here the PS want to see a shot not the
best
[Applause]
clearance
Robertson he made that interception look
routine in truth it
wasn't
yurian
Timber Thomas
[Applause]
FTE well whatever way you slice it
Stuart Mo Salah is a man you just can't
take your eyes off well Derek goal
scorers thrive on confidence and he's
certainly got an abundance of that at
the moment four goals in the last three
games every time he gets the ball he
looks like he's going to take a chance
he is in outstanding form at the
[Applause]
moment
pte
and he get them in front oh a vital
piece of last ditch
[Applause]
defending
pte well for cl 10 out of 10 for
placement maybe
[Applause]
eight
[Applause]
headed strongly to win the
[Applause]
ball Alexander zinenko
[Applause]
an encouraging Arsenal
move is this the moment terrific piece
of
anticipation now sending is in well just
the kind of save every goalkeeper would
expect to
make
high quality
defending pressing high up has its
advantages well what an opportunity that
was well that's a great chance to open
the scoring it's a poor effort in the
end and trouble is brewing oh tremendous
reflex action there from The Keeper he
didn't have long to react but that's a
top glass save I have to
say
Martin erard the supporters think it's
on oh did so well to deny
him can someone get on the end of this
not the best
clearance well that's how to keep the
opposition at
Bay now the counter attack looks
on oh managing to Beat
It the goal Liverpool strike first in
the final and just listen to their
fans well just look at this again the
speed of car sack is so impressive and
what a clever bit of play is from cah
both with his movement and his finish
that's a nice goal so underway again
here one n to
score
[Applause]
paring well nearing the break here and
Liverpool hold the edge Stewart how
about your assessment of what you've
seen from them in this first 45 well
it's been a tight game so far but
they've just had that little bit more
quality on the ball particularly in
Midfield where they've just started to
take control they'd be fairly happy
going at half time in stays like this oh
Stewart opportunity here maximum
commitment and he's given away the
corner
going
short well the crossing needs to be a
bit better than
[Applause]
that and
[Music]
[Music]
the
referee's whistle we've reached the
halfway so back in business the second
half underway it's Liverpool in front
but far from being Dum and
dusted Saka oh he's left his marker for
dead and a precise challenge just when
it was
required racing forward trying to catch
them out
oh good vision is it going to
be it is brilliantly
blocked wilting under the pressure and
now they try to go
forward cing
in a gift for any
goalkeeper
got great chance oh that would have been
a special goal had it gone
[Applause]
[Applause]
in
Alexander zinenko
now with
Jesus lost possession here
Arsenal 20 minutes to go
then Thomas

ball and Arsenal Now find themselves in
potentially a dangerous
position well still an
issue
here first Elli surely The
Equalizer fine tackle there to prevent
the
chance that's going to be a double
substitution now how about the short
Corner took a really smart piece of
Defending to
[Applause]
stop
can he take them on and beat
them well there was impending danger but
good defending and that's going to roll
all the way
through we might very well have late
excitement here 5 minutes to go and just
one goal between
them
Timber K
Ross
Thomas parte they have to show a
commitment to attack Arsenal in these
trying circumstances great
defending going is locked just can't get
