for
[Music]
Usman demele in the spotlight well he's
the most creative player on the field he
can run with the ball he can get himself
out of tight situations he can see a
pass he's very creative with his play I
think he's going to be the outstanding
player today
excitement in the Parisian air we're at
the PAC pass here in the French Capital
I'm Derek Ray in position to bring you
live match commentary and my expert
analyst as always on these occasions is
Stuart Robson and we're always thrilled
when a new campaign begins that's the
case here it is the first match of the
new season steuart how do you see this
one going yeah what an exciting match up
there start of a new rivalry and they'll
both be so eager to take the bragging
rights here on the opening day of the
season I can't can't wait for this
hopefully it lives up to the
billing good
tackle
iMobile oh the threat is there and what
a magical save it
[Applause]
was over it comes oh good save excellent
header danger averted for now but it'll
be another the
corner not all that convincing
defensively it's opening up for
them
marusich can they take the lead well
what a stop it was well I have to say
that's a magnificent save that's a top
class piece of goalkeeping a goal in the
early stages precisely what they had
been
planning really good into
reception Filipe
Anderson and made sure the pass wasn't
Troublesome and options in the
center it was on his way
[Applause]
in Philipe
Anderson and a DI by by the
post well they can't quite take
advantage in the end they're trying to
get right into his
face well had PSG gone to down I
couldn't see them recovering they need
to improve here and quickly but
understandable that they might look a
bit frazzled defensively but they have
more work to do at the
back oh surely and how about oh the
referee has given it penalty it
is
well he's avoided a booking but the
complaints continue and I can understand
why I think it's a poor foul it should
be a yellow card for
me and there it is perfectly
executed so underway again following the
goal that made things
level Nicolo
Rella not the pass he had in
[Applause]
mind chiro
iMobile
marusic can he put them in front but it
was a wonderful chance but the
goalkeeper comes through yes Derek we
have to give credit to the keeper but
surely he should have scored there
that's a big big
chance
demele
[Applause]
and not cleared away
properly kangin Lee well it lead to the
goal that puts them ahead look like a
certain goal but that's a great
challenge
Zaki can he find the right
pass
iMobile and defending as a
[Applause]
unit
hakeim vtor
fera well the attacking options appear
plentiful well nothing comes of it it
looked
[Applause]
promising
Rella
[Applause]
iMobile is it going to
be the keeper diving magnificent ently
to make sure he got there now the teams
are locked together will it stay that
way following this corner clearance
needed to be
[Applause]
better Nicolo
rll decent Position will it
be and he read it well defensively
[Applause]
hakeim making
progress
demele now with mbappe it was a menacing
attack but tidied up and that'll be
offside
Zaki immobil
now well he stopped them in their
tracks chiro iMobile in a position from
which they could potentially do a bit of
damage
here
iMobile onto Anderson
element of risk there but he's won the
ball must take the lead
here safe pair ofans did his
[Applause]
job not a huge chunk of added Time 1
minute the first half here comes to an
end
away they go again second half is
underway
[Applause]
[Applause]
here excellent
defending
kamada now Felipe
Anderson and teammates to play it
[Applause]
to iMobile can he do it to take the lead
and a goal it is to put them in front
again no less than they
[Applause]
deserve
and losing
[Applause]
possession good use of advantage in
favor of
[Applause]
PSG Manuel
laari daichi kamada
[Applause]
lazari chance to finish on a strong
glove on the ball from the keeper and
holding on to it at the second time of
asking
mbapp great opportunity it's gone in a
goal for PSG beyond the goalkeeper to
square things
up
Maric the ball with lu
Alberto
romanoli and return to iMobile can they
take the lead here well the keeper is
Happy the bar was
there well you sense the goals coming
they're getting so close now they just
need to take one these chances well
they're on the ball and they just got to
forget about that moment of Misfortune
really good buildup but no end product
effective piece of
[Applause]
pressing and that's great work to keep
it in
play
can he put them in front tremendous
defending to Stonewall
him daichi kamada well let's see what
they have in store for them on the
break is this the moment marinos with
the
[Music]
block
[Music]
well the concession of a corner here but
credit for the
challenge substitution it is for
PSG corner kick played
in well a corner right on the back of
the last
one
oh my goodness you've really got to
praise the defending that was
topnotch and into the last 20
minutes
[Applause]
demell Zaki
Running Room in the wide
[Applause]
position well there was imp pending
danger but good
[Applause]
defending well out of Play Under
Pressure Luis
Alberto and on to
marusic defensive Brazilians to shut
them
[Applause]
down well it's a good-looking position
is there a goal in their future but they
dealt with the threat
posed now the Counterattack looks
on oh that's a super ball over the
[Applause]
top it's looking
promising brilliantly
blocked a very significant Patty s m
Corner late in the
game fired over by Usman demele oh Super
Header but the goalkeeper was up to the
task vtor
fera well what a big moment that could
prove to be the keepers just kept them
in it what a save well on the back of
that breathtaking piece of goalkeeping
can they keep the ball and create and an
opportunity here for them to get their
noses in front from the
corner and short it
is must take the lead here crucial piece
of
[Applause]
Defending
elect to go
short Nicolo
Rella
casali is it going to be and a goal at
this stage of the game it might be
decisive and just look at their
supporters
[Applause]
not to like about that pass they've
regained
possession but doesn't have to do it on
his own this could be
it oh dear he's missed it well that
would have put the game to bed he had to
score there will it prove
[Applause]
costly and that will be all for this
game they final whistle is sounded and
it's a defeat for PSG yes Derek it was a
tight game between two very good sides
but they lost concentration late on and
it's cost them dearly they'll need to
get over that
quickly well Felipe Anderson served his
team well in typical fashion had a good
all round performance today only
emphasized by the late winner and
extremely important moment and boy did
he
deliver
girl that
girl that girl I already that girl
I
[Music]
already
[Music]
already swag in
day it your
girlfriend call up the St I'm about to
spin it I'm about to get it in a blink
of eye it's a new aesthetic wake up new
[Music]
[Music]
era
[Music]
is
[Music]
that
[Music]
[Music]
shall try not
foret would
you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
this is when it really hits home kickoff
time is almost upon us a colossal Game
featuring
[Music]
two team welcome everyone on a perfect
night for football with the flood lights
beaming down my name is Derek Ray and
I'm joined for commentary by the former
Arsenal and West Ham player Stuart
Robson I'm with kick off just moments
away we really should be in for a
magnificent occasion Stewart what are
you expecting to see well they didn't
play at their best last time out so
they'll need a better display today in
such a short campaign you can't afford
to lose two on the
bounce and here's how the lineup looks
for PSG Jan Luigi donaruma is the keeper
Lucas Hernandez plays with Ashraf Hakimi
in the fullback positions kangin Lee
plays alongside V fera in central
Midfield and the main threat in attack
today should be kilan
mbappe
iMobile well that's really sound
goalkeeping not letting the opposition
have any scraps and that will be a
corner and there's the delivery well no
end
[Applause]
product Well that took confidence still
a
chance well threat of
[Applause]
it kangin Lee and a good
tackle Felipe
Anderson Nicolo
[Applause]
rella and PSG will have a throw
in determined
[Applause]
defending chiro
iMobile
Pedro and a chance for him on the
flank Philipe Anderson can they Forge
ahead they do and you've got to say
they're good value for the
lead to win it
back in a position from which they could
potentially do a bit of damage here but
a good piece of Defending to bring it to
an
end imob
[Music]
[Applause]
real chance and there it is two goals on
a matter of minutes incredible
stuff Danilo
Pereira kangin
Lee on the pass by inpp he'll be
[Applause]
disappointed
[Applause]
now he must favor the
cross and that brings the attack to an
[Applause]
end chiro
iMobile he has teammates around
him oh great attacking play is this the
moment oh keeper dealt with it
well read to win possession
back well I have to say that was a fine
Save which just about keeps this game
alive hero
IMO well that was incisive well the fans
really want him for shoes and striking
the outside of the post with that effort
and it's going to be a goal kick
here
hakeim
mbapp they just let his opponent Glide
by and he's through here and there is
the goal well that changes the equation
and they have the momentum
now well the ball is moving again the
push is on from Paris s can they come up
with an
equalizer
Pedro iMobile
and return to Pedro and a decent
delivery corner kick awarded and let's
see if this will help them add to their
lead who can he pick out the danger is
still
there iMobile terrific block
there
marusic now with Alberto and collected
tidily he had plenty you think
[Applause]
about well on the cusp of the halftime
interval and PSG with a bit of work
ahead of them Stuart interested to get
your thoughts on their performance so
far well it's been a good game but
they've been second best in a couple of
key areas that needs to change in the
second half otherwise it's going to be a
disappointing result for
them that's very effective good high
pressing man
lugarti kangin Lee well that's how to
keep the opposition at
Bay and support available well it could
be on for him
here
Hernandez here's
a kangin
Lee
it's there for
him and a fine stop to turn the ball
away well there's an example of how to
press high up oh the threat is there oh
there it is unbelievable St from two
down they're right back in
this not many sides would have the
mental strength to bounce back from
adversity like this
team a lot of space to attack
back took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
them a chance then for the respective
managers to address their
[Applause]
charges so the two teams have switched
around and the second half is
[Applause]
underway
[Applause]
blee and a fine
tackle
Taki will he play it in chance to put
them in front and a goal just like that
they're back in front
well not quite what he wanted to do with
the
pass Tio
immobile
[Applause]
Anderson shot attempted it was on its
way in now in a more than decent
position
and the timing was perfect ball
one
Anderson and with that they thwarted the
[Applause]
opportunity
demele attacking possibilities for PSG
oh what a top do pass oh magnificent
from The Keeper fantastic
stop playing it in and making sure it
wasn't
[Applause]
problematic well making it simple for
the keeper in the
end Felipe
[Applause]
Anderson
now to take it
away the fans want to see a
shot is this the
moment and woodwork rather than net on
that occasion Stuart well you can see
the relief from The Keeper he thought
that was going in I certainly
did
marinos well far from the ideal
pass fipe
Anderson can he make it
count
iMobile and he's made it a brace for
himself the defender just unable to stay
with him and he's having a field
day
Pedro what can they do from
here and a throw in it's going to
be
imob and he stopped them in their
tracks
Lucas
Hernandez
Anderson absolutely spot on with that
challenge well you can tell what the
fans think of that decision they're
certain it should have been a penalty
Distributing it
well
deell and choosing finesse he might be
wishing he hadn't well it's good Vision
but not the skill to match I'm
afraid chiro iMobile well spot on with
that
challenge oh superb
skill
mbapp and the flag has gone up just when
he looked ready to pounce perhaps well
he was just too static in the end which
is a shame because that was a dangerous
situation fipe
Anderson
Roa
Zaki and quick thinking
defensively 15 minutes left for
play opportunity It is Well a piece of
quick Thinking by The Keeper well that's
great goalkeeping he read it so well
didn't he
[Applause]
this looks
promising Pedro can he finish this
terrific piece of
anticipation
mbappe well PSG have it back now
tele could reduce the deficit
brilliantly
[Applause]
blocked
rll
Zaki immobil
now being egged on by the crowd and a
goal to seal the hatrick a master pass
at finishing just can't stop him
today very quick thinking there can they
do something positive on the
Counterattack well at Peter
[Applause]
out
Pedro now Felipe
[Applause]
Anderson blee really nice
ball oh that's topnotch goalkeeping
you've got to
say so a throw in for
PSG kangin Lee and there it is a goal
but will it be purely a consolation at
the stage of the proceedings they
haven't been at the
[Applause]
best
the referee says enough is enough and
more negativity alas you just feel on
the back of this that winning the
title well it truly was a stellar
performance from Filipe Anderson Stuart
what caught your eye most of all about
what he put into the game well his
movement was brilliant today whether he
was running in behind or dropping into
pockets of space he caused all sorts of
problems what a good hat trick that
was it's like I've been smooth for so
long I'm trying to get rough buffing my
nails dog I'm trying to get buff shaping
my beard up I'm liking the Scruff the
hills cuz I'm living my life in the cut
can't imagine that I'm going to be my

[Music]
I despite the the Brick the ceiling up
here I'm Freer than
the A fitting backdrop but a match of
massive significance the stage is set a
packed house and hello to you frommer
City that's never short of style I'm
talking of course about the French
Capital Paris we're at the pack de pass
I'm Derk Ray your match commentator and
alongside providing all the Tactical
analysis is Stuart Robson and with the
title perhaps slipping away a positive
performance is a prerequisite if they
are to remain in the hunt it's Paris
sgain up against inter well thanks Derek
they're 90 minutes away from losing the
title so they have to play with a bit of
Freedom attack from the first whistle
and give it everything you never know it
might start a
comeback and Inter might be able to cash
in here
[Applause]
able to clear the danger corner kick Mo
[Applause]
here playing it
short chanu a deep
delivery really fine piece of Defending
play to break us
up that is how to apply the
pressure could cross it in here oh L
ditch defending and it's very f
[Applause]
finest an effective
challenge
fratesi inter in a position of Menace
can he put them in front oh a challenge
of the highest
[Applause]

the lead here oh strong hand on the

ball
dumri on the ball
Baston federo
dearco
chanu Running With The Ball
confidently dum cutting it back it might
be they found the net and who knows it
could be the goal that wins them the
championship well it's theirs for the
taking now will that be the defining
moment and unable to keep
[Applause]
possession
[Applause]
Martinez
demele it will be a p SAR free
[Applause]
kick Danilo
Pereira there to take it
[Applause]
away now what can inter do from this
position well disappointing end to the
move
[Applause]
and threaded through by
mbappe well he moved into an illegal
position well he had the vision to pick
out the through Ball but he couldn't
play it quite quickly
enough mikitarian a glorious chance
there It Is Magical moment surely one
hand on the trophy well history bet
surely they can't throw this away
[Applause]
now well time just challenged
magnificently and the referee has
decided to award the free kick to
PSG and passing it
[Applause]
through
[Applause]
chanu and they will be awarded a free
kick for
[Applause]
that oh could be an O great opportunity
well I must say a really nice looking
chip and almost rewarded yeah that was a
good effort but it just doesn't come
down in time a bit unlucky
there mbapp
effective
[Applause]
challenge vter struggling to keep the
ball
[Applause]
mbapp Manuel
Ugarte vtor fera
hakeim oh totally committed but still
dangerous just failing to hit the target
good effort
[Applause]
though David
fratesi the ball with
martinez plenty of supports
here it's an
[Applause]
opportunity oh it comes to nothing in
the end really should have made more of
that
F no foul PSG Advantage well sometimes
Advantage just doesn't work out and the
referee has awarded a free kick
now
and making the run to the
inside very alert defending to cut off
the
[Applause]
supply
barela and return to
dumre mkhitarian oh my goodness you've
really got to praise the defending that
was
[Applause]
top-notch and a tidy
tackle
chanu delivering it into the box and
it's a double for him in this game no
way for the opposition to contain him
and no wonder he's off
celebrating well the electronic board
showing one additional
[Applause]
minute
dearco so the whistle then we're up the
halfway
so the ball is moving again and it was a
delightful performance from inter in the
first half of this
[Applause]
match d
f targets available cross comes in not
too fussy in clearing his
lines well it looked so promising but a
goal kick the
[Applause]
[Applause]
outcome
marinos well made it look routine but
read it well and he might be through
here and you cannot argue with a hatrick
simply Unstoppable
today a lopsided contest
4-0
mbapp
mbapp oh crucial tackle
brilliant
chanu
dumri
betesi barela and fed
forwards and he scored not once but
twice they simply cannot stop him and no
wonder he's enjoying
himself Lucas
Hernandez
Ugarte
he read the situation defensively and
did his
job mbapp Kell and
mbappe and a goal Here There It Is
they've done
it ready
set barel Hanging On To The Bard in this
fashion suits them and take it
away
Martinez onto
D and there is the goal he's found the
net Jo
[Music]
unconfined and Inter have it once
[Applause]
again
[Applause]
mbappe and cutting it
[Music]

challenge Henrick
mkhitaryan d
f just the challenge that was
required Killian

mbapp
mbappe
[Applause]

[Applause]
with this might be ideal for the
[Applause]
counter well disappointing end to the
move
[Music]
federo
dearco it's with
chalano
martinez d
f really good buildup but no end
product
well racing past his
man well knocked on the Target The
Keeper seemed to have it covered well he
did seem to have it covered but it's not
a bad effort though he really did strike
it
well oh is he going to be punished
here on over the top but it will go
through to the
[Applause]
keeper well they were looking for
something extra special on the pitch
they simply haven't been able to deliver
it and the price paid yeah today just
epitomizes their season really it's a
shocking performance they need a small
miracle if they to deny their opponents
the title and I certainly don't believe
in miracles
Derek long way out oh what a goal a
tremendous strike hard to believe that
he elected to take on that shot
absolutely
brilliant
demele and demele has given it
away well it comes down to the final 5
minutes Henrik mikhitarian
[Applause]
barela
Martinez can he take
advantage B is
loose and problem solved for
now
mbappe now the quick Counterattack could
be on well it petered
[Applause]
out there will be one minute added on at
the
[Applause]
end
mbapp and that is it a hard result for
them to digest and with that their title
hopes have officially been dashed yeah
they haven't been quite good enough and
that was the case again today second
best in most areas of the pitch now they
have to watch the celebrations they
won't like
that well this is special for everybody
at
the
[Music]
[Music]

of the most famous venues in World
football we're here at the sanero I'm
Derek Ray and delighted to have Stuart
Robson sharing commentary duties with me
and this is the day when every football
fan is expectant and optimistic opening
day it's inter against Paris simman oh
surely a truly magnificent start an
early goal in the game just what they
were hoping to
produce
mbapp oh him with a
chance and he struck the
oh Stellar defensive work to get back
and win
possession well how unlucky with PSG
they really did deserve the level there
but they need to keep the pressure on
[Applause]
now
dearco the ball with martinez will he
shoot the fans hope
so will he
finish and able to get a body in the way
and a goal this time applying the
Finishing Touch just what the doctor
ordered
MPP that's a good looking
[Applause]
ball
MPP can he find the
angle well what a stop it was well I
have to say that's a magnificent save
that's a top class piece of
goalkeeping well you can't really have
them any better than that but the
goalkeeper was up to the
task could P one back here and he does
he's thrown his team a Lifeline the
belief is
back well underway once more this is far
from being in the bag PSG making sure of
that
mikitarian
oh big
opportunity and the goal was staring him
in the face but he couldn't take
advantage of the chance well that would
have extended their lead what a golden
opportunity that
was kangin
Lee here's
mbappe decent
[Music]
position well just the tackle that was
needed
Martinez turam took a really smart piece
of Defending to stop
them
[Applause]
mbapp
barela
dearco the ball with
martinez excellent assessment of the
situation at the
back well that's how to do it inside
your own penalty
area
[Applause]
demele kangin Lee
superb defensive judgment to end the
[Applause]
attack Marcus
tuam it's with
chalano good looking ball and nicely
over the
[Applause]
top mikitarian
it's a perfect challenge
well attacking possibilities for the
nurri oh good
save playing it
short
chanu now will the cross work out for
them ready to fire well what a stop that
was and a tidy
tackle chanu body on the line barela now
with
chanu oh did so well to deny
him doing everything possible to keep
possession well that was such a good
stop from donaruma and may be a very
important one they're not developing
nicely for them here and top not as well
as Brave goalkeeping well he comes off
his line at just the right time he read
that
brilliantly
mkhitaryan
chanu and a long way out
here mikitarian not Advantage with them
referee says play on is it going to be
mkhitarian well I think it's fair to say
he got underneath that just a little bit
we can get more details on that injury
situation from our man pit side Jeff
shes Jeff yeah you can see he's got a
problem with his foot looks as though
he's treading on it a little tenderly oh
what a chance this might be really
committed
defending Henrik
mkhitarian well as you can see inter
have been in complete control in the
last 15 minutes and look like scoring
every time they go forward they do need
to extend their lead though while
they're playing so
well really fine piece of Defending play
to break us
[Applause]
up barela CR into the penalty area was
it a great
clearance and there we have it the first
half comes to an end here at the
sanero
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
and they get the ball rolling in the
second half into hold the Advantage but
it's a long way from being done
undusted Martinez quadrado and still a
chance and he took care of it
defensively
marinos de Bell on the
ball
and the referee has decided to award the
free kick to
[Applause]
PSG kangin
[Applause]
Lee Manuel
Ugarte a really single-minded piece of
Defending to make sure nothing unto
happened
well Laro Martinez did look as though he
was enjoying himself in the first half
what did you make of him well I really
liked his first half this oh look at
this they must score and making sure
there was no danger in the
end good

making he cuts it back
back can he put it away and he scored
not once but twice they simply cannot
stop him and no wonder he's enjoying
himself and he read it
well
Martinez could be and it's two for him
today a masterful performance The
Defenders unable to stop it kangin
Lee promising sequence mbappe in the
center ball is
loose oh Splendid header but a fine
save Corner given to
PSG oh how about that for the last line
of
defense is it going to be a goal here

disappointing Paris sanj performance you

been a bit unlucky today they certainly
haven't been two goals worse than their
opponents but in key moments they've
just been found wanting particularly
defensively well they might be able to
launch a
Counterattack well it looked so
promising but it all comes to
nothing
Martinez
quadrado and making sure there was no
danger in the
end and the flag is up offside well
that's just a lack of awareness he was
clearly in an offside
position and a throw for
inter

settle the issue once and for
