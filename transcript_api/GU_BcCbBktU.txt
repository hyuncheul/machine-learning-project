what up guys welcome back to another CNC
video today we're going to be reacting
to the still year season 2024 cinematic
by League of Legend I'm a big fan of the
cinematics not such a big fan of the
game not because I suck but because it
pisses me off we're watch both play the
game and I don't really usually watch
cinematics even though I so good they're
they're catfishing the game they the
cinematics they're so good people are
like I'm going to download League of
Legends and then they just end up no I
really I am a big lore fan of way when
it comes to league but I don't really
watch cinematics for some reason I think
that I should like I always watch them
backwards like the ones that have been
released ages ago I just watched them
not when they released for some reason
but this one has been released six days
ago and now this is my first time
watching it again looking forward to
seeing this one the music is uh is what
Riot games has always been been really
big into yeah that's true and uh I hope
this is going to
be it's going to be nice I've seen so
many positive like comments and just
good feedback on this cinematic so I
think that I have really high
expectations by now so I'm ready to
watch it all right without further Ado
let's get
this tomorrow is a
hope never a
promise oh D TR yeah
okay Bo sleep him I thought it was de
no look at that oh that's good
graphics it's really
good
yeah look at that look at how good they
look though you can't even recognize
them
yeah
okay the song is so
[Music]
good
this damn
yo
look at that Hard detail
there it's so good so far oh my God the
reflection
of the song is on point they just never
miss believe that this is work you
know okay absolutely
wait that left my look
familiar is that
Jack it's either Jack or
Y
[Music]
yeah no it reminded me of J
I don't know
why yeah it's
is's Master though no it's 100% why is
his hair gray cuz maybe he got old dude
it's like whatever
[Music]
season nice nice nice nice 10 see it's
yeah of course you can see his hair
like
I'm bro
[Music]
got r games never disappoints this
what's with the
eyes is it like the hill like
eyes okay what's up with
turn look like
FR bro Shir lless in that gold of course
nice
Oho the music is so good on my I said
this three times but K that also looks
absolutely
insane in
my is it
ash oh you got save for us he got save
look at
her oh for for us the wife show
[Music]
them yes give him the vision was that it
oh my God I expeced more no Z action
where's it I was hoping for war to D
that was still is 4 minutes so what what
you can't really put a lot in four
minutes I I really think that even for
four minutes it like takes you somewhere
it's really well well well well well
well done yeah I expected 10 out of 10
when it comes to music and they
delivered 10 out of 10 bro I'm actually
like even though it's not surprising
that the graphics are that good it's
still amazing yeah it makes me play
league and then I hop on league but
league is nothing like this this is just
like lore but League itself
no but Kindra showing up that kind of I
wasn't like anticipating that I I wasn't
hoping to see her oh let me see also
look at this yeah man it's so good yeah
see but you know why is that related to
lore cuz kindra's like death and trender
was like almost dead so Kindra showed up
oh really she was trying to take trendir
I think and then he resisted and then
the wolf attacked him because that's how
it works L her bro just press
far be
godamn what can you do but look at arrox
he
is
humongous yeah bro like a
yeah he's he's absolutely look at look
at the his blade is as big as Morana
yeah but look at this the detail of the
blade hold on where is it I think when
he attacked the blade look at that it's
yeah exposing
yeah that's insane that's actually ab
and also the song
dude look him she CED
him my boy
red yeah it's the song just goes goes
perfectly it's hand in hand so we got
some atro kale Morana Morgana yasu but
it looks like a new skin or something
he's old yes it's like a bit surprising
for me and then we got uh was it trir
Ash and kendri yeah but I was expecting
a bit more just I don't know maybe it's
insane to me still that kri showed up
because it's so connected to the lore
it's really well done yeah it took me
off guard genuinely can just showing up
it's good it's really well done well
what can I say it was was a really good
uh also nice nice details with Ash
showing up the arrows and everything
yeah don't yeah I can really compare it
to other cinematics I think that the
only ones that I've actually seen with
big interest are the vgo ones with
reation and Shadow o and all that cuz
that was like epic with thres also and
all that yeah yeah so if I compare it to
this one well obviously I think the
graphics are better
but story-wise both are really really
like
intriguing they get true well I give
this one a nine out of 10 because if it
would have been a 10 out of 10 Zed would
have showed
up you're biased just a bit just a tiny
bit oh for me it's a 10 out of 10 I
don't think that anything was missing if
it was longer it would have been amazing
but if it's longer than it's low key
like a mini movie yeah this is really
good so all right guys we're going to
wrap this up let us know if you've seen
