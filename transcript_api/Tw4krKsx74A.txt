all goes to plan they can progress to a
promotion match Stuart your expectations
well Derek I think this will be tense
but they know a good performance and a
victory will give them access to a
promotion match it should be an
interesting
game and the referee takes exception to
the Challenge
free

the tension because there's so much on
the line if they win they make it
through to the promotion match it is
that simple do they have the mental
fortitude

Robson and the hope is they'll be able

[Applause]
heril Campbell with
it
and a clear foul but the referee letting
the play
Flow well read to win possession back No
Nonsense
clearance well he'll be determined to
drink in the occasion because it will be
a milestone appearance for him today
well what a good signing he's been
consistent hardworking and talented
let's hope his 100th game is a good one
he deserves it
that's a good pass a matter of keeping
his composure a truly magnificent start
an early goal in the game just what they
were hoping to
produce not high quality
defending Reed
now Campbell with
it well not quite what he wanted to do
with the
pass good visualization and
execution can she put it away oh a
challenge that simply had to be
won
Özil and nicely over the
top and crossed in there well the
Harless
and I don't suppose she needs reminding
of
that well not great for the
[Applause]
keeper the through
[Applause]
ball
AB it needs an accurate cross Ramsey oh
such an elegant finish how about that on
the volley a brilliant strike whatever
way you look at
it
Cavani it's with
Novak well they're on the scent of
something
positive excellent ball over the top and
just wide with a
header
a quick thinking to win it
back that's a good
ball the cross is on decent cross but
nobody in the
vicinity can he do it ball is loose and
there it is a goal I must say much to
the annoy of the
keeper is this going to be a thrashing 3
n now and the referee spot of the foul
but has played
advantage ö and passing it well and the
decision offside
[Applause]
here it has gone over the touch line for
what'll be a
throwing
[Applause]
Özil
Jong perfect tackle not the best
Challenge free
[Applause]
kick three
tremendous intuition to win it
back racing forward trying to catch them
out can't miss surely oh the crossb is
still
reverberating danger rted for
now an inability to keep hold of the
ball
there that easily cut out in the
end must be and the challenge crisp and
clean that's a lovely
ball making
progress well they get the ball once
more
free kick awarded then by the
[Applause]
referee delivered into the box danger
avered well we're almost at the halfway
stage and they're not making hum
Advantage work for them one little bit
here Stuart your assessment well I'm
almost lost the words because this just
hasn't been good enough and it starts
with their defending the bers haven't
pressed the ball the Midfield players
have been too loose and the Defenders
haven't seen danger I just can't see a
way back for
them Reed
now it's with Novak that's a good
looking
ball and there's the goal she was hoping
for now she can
[Applause]
celebrate well here you can see it again
good run great strength and a composed
finish Under Pressure that's a top class
goal no shortage of goals on this match
3-1 can he do it from miles out asking a
lot of any player quite honestly to
score from that position well I don't
need to say too much about that do I
Derek and one minute of stoppage time
has been added
on well possibilities in the
center really good buildup but no end
product well the story of the first half
has been written it's halim here in
[Applause]
VI
[Applause]
in
so back underway here into the second
[Applause]
half now can she pick out a
teammate not made it look routine but
read it
well
Reed
surely oh the keeper made it look
routine it was anything
but good tackle what can she do from
here and the referee sensibly allowing
them to carry on Advantage with them and
defensive play to be
apped this could be dangerous if he's
not
[Applause]
careful feeding it through oh could
finish oh and it goes under another goal
and I'll tell you what the impossible is
becoming quite
possible AB the delivery towards the
back post good well to clear it
away the high press was on and that's a
fantastic
[Applause]
tackle
well there's an example of how to press
high up excellent strike well the keeper
made the save pretty easily in the
end
cbell now they have possession in a good
area of the
[Applause]
pitch need to take great care the
referee correctly decided to play
Advantage
Özil The Tackle taken
away
Jong Campell on the
ball Reed
now oh nice ball over the top
and now their turn to have the
[Applause]
ball
Ramsey and the flag does go up
offside plenty of players waiting in the
middle able to clear the danger at least
for
now
oh that's a super ball over the top a
decisive clearance it was well chasing
this game but the corner might help
them well the crowd of doing their bit
can they find The Equalizer here oh can
you believe this back from the brink and
wild celebrations on the touch
line underway again with we can't
complain about a lack of entertainment
[Applause]
33 that's a good looking ball a nearly
the ideal Ball but a good piece of
Defending Reed
now
J
[Applause]
GRE fluency of movement
frag Rays for
[Applause]
offside
[Applause]
Ramsey and nicely over the
top who can he pick out and a wretched
cross really over
[Applause]
everyone
and the danger
clear losing
possession and space to exploit maybe
delivered into the area here oh good
save excellent header will this corner
bear fruit for
them that's an effective cross aimed at
the back post and that's the hatrick
tearing apart this defense time and
again they simply can't handle
him well here it is again the Deep
Corner cuts out so many of those
Defenders including the keeper and it
ends up with a fairly simple finish
certainly not much the goalkeeper can do
about
that
three and passing it well they're
showing a willingness to attack as they
must given the circumstances time
running out and clears his lines
[Applause]
every goalkeeper would expect to catch
that
[Applause]
one and a chance to whip it in
here it did look on for them but not to
be and the counter looks on here options
available can he finish them all he's
done it what a climax to this
[Applause]
game not a score line we see all that
often
53 Reed
now possession lost
intercepted
Crossing
possibilities good
[Applause]
tackle and one minute of stoppage time
has been added on good ball over the
top
and there it is the final whistle not
what the home fans were hoping for
before a ball was kicked
today as a team and they didn't deserve
anything from the game need a much
better display next time
[Applause]
out
the prize today is considerable win the
game and make it through to the
promotion match a big test of every
player's
