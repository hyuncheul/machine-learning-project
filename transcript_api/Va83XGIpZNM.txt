it doesn't get much better than being
able to call yourself the record scorer
for a football club but last time out we
saw him make history and revel in the
moment now the prospect of more goals
from this highly gifted footballer who
rarely fails to deliver on the
pitch stay tuned for all the live action
next on EA
[Applause]
TV and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be enrolling I'm
Derek Ray your match commentator and
alongside providing all the Tactical and
technical analysis it's Stuart Robson
and delighted to be bringing you club's
match action Stuarts what are you
expecting thanks Derek well often we
talk about the tactics the individual
players players that are missing but so
often it's the mentality of the players
that is key to winning any football game
which of these teams has the right
attitude today is the big
question and given
away options in the
center and that's a corner
[Applause]
and over it
comes oh that's top-notch goalkeeping
you've got to
say well he really is danger personified
but in this game Stuart what do you
think we might see from him well in many
ways he's a throwback to the 80s in the
way he plays he's so strong when holding
up the play he can outmuscle opponents
today the Defenders will certainly know
they've been in a
[Applause]
battle
blue
Diaz and quick thinking
defensively an effect of
ball chance to cross
now the attack fizzled
out useful looking position you've got
to
say
AAR and a decent delivery and a goal to
open the scoring no wonder they're
celebrating
[Applause]
well here it is again just look at the
quality of the Cross it's inch perfect
but the Finish is far too easy he
doesn't even have to jump how has he
afforded that much space it's a tidy
header but really poor
defending deserves credit for winning
the ball
back
pulls it
back and a very good
challenge and the pass not quite
accurate enough and a throw in
[Applause]
then good through
ball a terrific defense ending to stop
them
progressing that's a high quality
[Applause]
pass well goal kick just as it was
looking
promising onto
Bruno
good looking pass oh just mtim his run
and the flag going
up good ball over the
top let's see about the
cross and stopping the
danger a really single-minded piece of
defending to make sure nothing unto
happened
Pino released it
nicely possession and patience the
watchwords and he needed a bit more
downward Direction on the
[Applause]
header well that's what on for them to
pursue
[Applause]
lindegard well they win the throw
following that
challenge well there it is the host
haven't had that much of the ball but
they've certainly shown an ability to
Counterattack when they win it back I
expect more of the same I think it's
been a really good performance from them
so
far
[Applause]
and defensive play to be
applauded
Bruno
Diaz really good wide play veryy
comfortable piece of
Defending
lindegard that's excellent defending
following the
cross
Diaz
[Applause]
Bale moving the ball nicely trying to
carve out the
equalizer not smooth in possession
able to skip past his man super
[Applause]
challenge oh Foul Play says the
referee that's a lovely
ball Crossing
possibilities
so one minute of stoppage time that's
what the officials have said good
pressure to win the ball back chance to
finish can they cover
up that is that for the first half
[Applause]
[Applause]
here
yeah it's not the best
well underway once more and it's going
to be fascinating to see what
developments occur in this second
half and played the pass
well opportunity here can they keep it
out well last gas defending but
brilliant defending under real pressure
here well that saves just about keep
keeps them in this but they have to pose
more of a threat at the other
end a tremendous
vision and the referee has awarded a
corner following that
[Applause]
touch
who's going to get on the end of it and
the danger still
on just cleared away in the nick of
time a good and fair
challenge
Diaz Roman
lindegard can they create something from
[Applause]
here giving it a try and a goal to
square the game head to the seat
St so underway again following the goal
that made things
level
Al we've had a pair of C keys in at
reception car keys and the wallet if
those are your items please collect them
after committed
challenge could be dangerous and still a
chance good piece of
Defending he could pick out a
teammate and it took a little Nick
before it went over the touch line so a
throw in here and danger revers it well
read
[Applause]
brilliant pass not quite the clearance
they were hoping
for from one side of the pitch to the
other and the danger is
[Applause]
averted well very effective play in
possession oh it was a crucial
[Applause]
challenge it's with
Amar a bit sloppy in
possession promising looking ball well
it looked like it might lead to
something very positive indeed but a
useful
interception
[Applause]
Bale
lindegard a really single-minded piece
of Defending to make sure nothing unto
happened and into the last 20
minutes
well making considerable progress with
the ball decisive in the tackle and a
throw in
here well as you can see the visitors
have had most of the ball but their
attacking players like Tempo invention
and goal something they need to rectify
quickly if they're going to win this
one well first order of business is to
win the ball
back
[Applause]
and the referee is quite rightly letting
it
go just 15 minutes
remaining the attack carried an initial
threat but fizzled
[Applause]
out
good Vision can he get onto this well it
comes to nothing in the end offside well
he doesn't need to make his movement
quite so quickly there just let the ball
be played into the
[Applause]
space
Diaz
lindegard level pegging but can they
change
that oh the threat is there and his
teammate got him out of
trouble might be a chance to break a
good Vision there well they couldn't
quite use that break in the manner that
they'd
hoped well time is running out to get
this winner but the fans certainly
believe it's coming just listen to the
noise what a fantastic finish we could
have
here
and playing it
through oh great header Smart Stop
though one terrific save after
another
Diaz
Pino
[Applause]
blue and given away trying to get on to
the front foot with the minutes ticking
away oh that's a super piece of
[Applause]
Defending there will be one minute added
on at the
end it has gone over the touch line for
what'll be a throw
[Applause]
in
[Applause]
good distribution well not cleared away
completely and there as the referee
whistle for full time even Steven here
they can't be separated we were treated
to goals and Stuart interested to get
your verdict well Derek what a good game
it was plenty of chances some good
attacking play and a couple of
outstanding individual performances I
really enjoyed that
[Applause]
one
your
your
mission accomplished when last we saw
this gifted player when you enter the
history books it's a moment to drink in
and as officially speaking the club's
alltime leading scorer now every reason
to expect more attacking Excellence
today next on
eatv good evening and welcome ahead of
what should be a pulsating night of
football my name is Derek Ray and
sitting alongside me in the commentary
box providing expert analysis it's
Stuart Robson and it's going to be
fascinating to see how these two sides
Fair as they come up against each other
Stuart tell us about your pre-match
thoughts and that'll be
[Applause]
offside
Ria
it doesn't get much better than being
able to call yourself the record scorer
for a football club but last time out we
saw him make history and revel in the
moment now the prospect of more goals
from this highly gifted footballer who
rarely fails to deliver on the
[Music]
pitch don't go anywhere we'll have all
the action live on
eatv one of the great things about
football is that no one knows for sure
what's going to happen let's see what
unfolds here tonight I'm Derek Ray and
sitting next to me with his tactics
charts at the ready is Stuart Robson and
the stage is set for club's match action
how do you see the match going Stuart
and a goal they start as they mean to
continue they make the opening
statement so the ball rolling again with
the score line standing at 1
n
demele
pan The Possession lost
[Applause]
intercepted well that's the sign of a
well organized
defense
can he finish
this and stopping the
[Applause]
danger is it going to end up being
productive for them a routine
[Applause]
save
Bruno well they get the ball once
more
Leo really fine piece of Defending play
to break us up unable to get himself
back on side here well he was always
going to be offside that was the wrong
option Phil Jones that's Phil Jones
please contact your nearest stward thank
you opportunity in the wide area
well made it look routine but read it
well
pan and pressing from the
front well nicely cut out now what can
they do with the
ball pan
demele
Leo that's a good
ball well he was under a bit of stress
but back to the
keeper this could be dangerous if he's
not
careful
lindegard and snuffed out the danger
immediately
[Applause]
Peno now with
Bruno couldn't keep the
ball on attacking
possibilities direct ball into the the
Box just wanted to get it out of
there and a significant block following
that
cross that's what you call defending
from the front possibilities here
beautiful pass crossed into the penalty
area well not cleared away
completely that's effect of pressure
high up the pitch and flag raised
offside well that was always going to be
offside he just needed to hold on to the
ball that little bit
longer clearly
[Applause]
offside
Diaz emphasis on the clearance a good
one
[Applause]
and the ball in behind the
Defenders and that is
[Applause]
offside this is Bruno and winning it
back d
has
[Applause]
blue this is
Bruno might be able to produce from this
position and a decent
delivery cleared Away comprehensively
really clever
[Applause]
pressing now with Bruno that's a lovely
ball pretty comfortable piece of
Defending
well read to put an end to that
attack can he find the right
pass Leo electing to cross into the
center a decisive clearance it
[Applause]
was
Diaz
lindegard promising
pass and a chance to whip it in
[Applause]
here and a passing sequence that's easy
on the eye but it was a good-looking
sequence but it comes to an
[Applause]
end being pressed
here over the touch line for a throw
in
Bale not a promising looking attack but
comes to nothing in the
end and there goes the halftime whistle
that will do
[Applause]
it
[Applause]
well lzo away once more and it's going
to be fascinating to see what
developments occur in this second
half a really good
pass it needs an accurate Cross C it
[Applause]
back well since they have the ball the
referee playing Advantage
here and the cross not sufficiently well
played
in that's a useful
cross the crossb got in the way and a
goal they've increased the lead and they
don't want to be throwing it away from
here so back underway with the score
line standing at
2-0 Leo oh he's given it
away moving the ball forward how
creative can they
be really getting stuck
in oh nice
ball they couldn't hang on to it
again well he has the measure of his
opponent now they've lost
[Applause]
blue
Bale well he want strong ly into the
challenge and the result is a throw
in
Bale not the best
clearance well they can keep possession
now
Leo
pan well High marks for that
pass not much defensive cover there on
the flank and collected tidily he had
plenty to think
about clearly took a touch on the way
out of play so a throw in to
come well the visitors as you can see
have enjoyed so much of the possession
and as a result have dominated the game
some of their passing movements have
been a joy to watch and I don't think
anything's going to change
that strong but fair
tackle delivered into the
box danger Aver
it now breaking at PACE potential
[Applause]
danger and behind it's gone for a
corner
and over it comes not the most confident
[Applause]
clearance 20 minutes to go in this
[Applause]
one is this the moment and a corner kick
the referee
verdict
[Applause]
trying to deliver it accurately text
foot goalkeeping following the
[Applause]
corner
lindegard well possibilities in the
center and the referee Blows the Whistle
it is a free
kick
[Applause]
perfectly positioned to take it
away oh lovely weighted ball they might
be in well the flag was up in good time
bringing that move to an end but he's
just got to be more patient there he's
gone too
early
Leo well they could run onto it here can
she do
it great
defending well could this be the Turning
Point the fans are certainly hoping
so and taken
short on the flag raised offside it
[Applause]
is now with Bruno while the score line
means they can focus on keeping
possession an important
interception
and a good looking
pass chance to play it
[Music]
in oh tremendous work from The Keeper to
avert the danger Corner
[Applause]
given over it comes and there's an
example of how to do it dealing with a
corner
Diaz
this is Bruno so on the cusp of the
final whistle and the visitors very much
in command Stuart yeah this has been a
good performance they've looked really
sharp going forward and they've shown a
lot of energy they'll certainly be
pleased with their overall display up to
now and foul it is
then and so into the final five
minutes this looks promising out wide
well the cross didn't get past the first
Defender
Leo
Isco far from a good
pass
lindegard and intercepted
It 2 minutes of stoppage time coming
up
lindgard well let's see about the cross
and defensive play to be
applauded and there it is the fulltime
whistle here and it's a victory for for
the visitors well Derek it was a
comfortable win in the end fully deserve
their Victory because they
got
I
there's more tension in the air than
usual and you can understand why if they
get the victory today they'll be assured
of a place in the promotion match and
that is nothing to be sniffed
at it's today the day next on EA
TV good evening and welcome ahead of
what should be a pulsating night of
football I'm your match commentator
Derek Ray and sitting alongside me the
former Arsenal West Ham and commentary
Midfield player Stuart Robson and if all
goes to plan they can progress to a
promotion match how do you see the match
going Stuart well Derek I think this
will be tense but they know a good
performance and a victory will give them
access to a promotion match it should be
an interesting
game onto
Bruno
[Applause]
lindegard
[Applause]
and Cristiano has it now well they have
the advantage that's good
refereeing well read to put an end to
that
[Applause]
Attack released it
nicely well that's good defending well
organized at the
back
oh it was a crucial
[Applause]
Challenge and a throw in fourth
coming wilting under the pressure and
now they try to go forward after the
foul a chance to contemplate what is
next and perhaps a goal from this free
kick
[Applause]
he can't hold on to it well I take my
hat off to him because that was superb
defending what a creative look about
this
laid into the
center well nothing comes of
[Applause]
it blade
over and the referee sensibly allowing
them to carry on Advantage with
them
Bale well he knows he's got to enjoy
what is a special occasion for him a
landmark appearance well 100 games for
this club Derek and many more to come I
would say such a good player and key to
the way this team plays as we'll see
[Applause]
today promising
pass took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
them make your way to theck off you have
your so a throw in
here
and Kelly with
it
Doyle back with
Ramos
[Music]
Doyle that's useful play
and space to cross it alert
defending now can they counter
clinically well they have to pay
attention well that'll be a free
[Applause]
kick no card but the referee clearly
stating that's the last
warning how about the
cross well the bar can be the
goalkeeper's best friend and striking
the cross
bar and back with Kelly
[Applause]
now a really single-minded piece of
Defending to make sure nothing unto
happened and foul it is
[Applause]
then and given
away
lindgard
blue defensive Brazilians to shut them
down well let's see what they have in
store for them on the
break can they use it to their
advantage well did well to win the ball
back just unable to get his cross beyond
the first
Defender with the game level let's see
what they can do with this
[Applause]
corner
the delivery pretty comfortable piece of
Defending and not a great Challenge free
kick
here onto
Bruno a very timely
interception options in the
[Applause]
middle
delivering it into the
box still a
chance he'll be breathing a sigh of
relief ball
one well plenty of scope for them to
attack Crossing into the middle cleared
away
comprehensively an important
interception The Defenders know you
can't really allow space like
that and one minute of stoppage time has
been added on well just not properly
looking after the
ball and so it is the first half story
has been
written
[Applause]
[Applause]
lot
well they've got things going again here
and I wonder what kind of second half we
have in store for
us now who can she pick
out well no danger
[Applause]
now
and moving the ball forward with genuine
purpose
[Applause]
here clean
[Applause]
challenge
lindgard
well conceding the throw in good
challenge well lovely work to get fast
as
man but no damage done that's the main
thing good piece of closing
[Applause]
down Diaz
[Applause]
Bale here's
Ramos and Kelly with
it here's
Ramos
in a decent position
now well but tackling like that the onus
is on the referee to take action
potentially tremendous intuition to win
it back
and the referee allowing the game to
flow using Advantage could be in
here not out of the woods yet and
cleared behind for what is going to be a
corner
kick trying to deliver it
accurately and a simple clearance a good
one that's a good looking
[Applause]
ball
[Applause]
space on the
[Applause]
flank well he stumped it out of there
without much
fuss high quality
defending now with
Bruno
Running With The Ball
[Applause]
confidently textbook closing down and
now they're on the attack and up for
grabs off the
keeper danger
averted and into the last 20
[Applause]
minutes
[Applause]
Pino now with
Bruno
lindgard and possession given
away
[Applause]
looking for that final pass looking for
the goal that would put them
[Applause]
ahead well I have to say these fans are
doing everything to drive their team
forward
here
[Applause]
Diaz and it's a quality pass well he's
been ruled to have taken up an illegal
position only just however Stuart well
he loves running off the back of
Defenders but on this occasion he's just
gone a fraction too
early and they're on the front foot
looking for a winner near the end of
this game and in the right position to
read
it
and options in the
center and quick thinking
defensively plenty of supports
here not to like about that pass a
decisive clearance it
was
could cross it in here wonderful chance
but I have to say that was begging to be
put away well I was never known for my
finishing ability but I would have put
that away that's a shocking
Finish Well pressing really
high try to get onto the front foot with
the minutes ticking away
insufficient guile on the crossing front
you've got to
say
blue there will be one minute added on
at the
end now with
Bruno and with that the referee brings
this match to an end both sides had
their moments over the course of the 90
minutes but it finishes in a stalemate
Stewart
what
the
a crucial day stands in front of them
the knowledge that a win is required to
make it through to the promotion match
and no doubt about it their opponents
won't be of a mind to do them any favors
at
[Applause]
all next on
[Applause]
eatv
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers
racing
hello
everyone on tenter hooks you can feel
the tension because there's so much on
the line if they win they make it
through to the promotion match it is
that simple do they have the mental
fortitude
[Applause]
necessary stay with us on
[Music]
[Applause]
eatv one of the great things about
football is that no one knows for sure
what's going to happen let's see what
unfolds here tonight my name is Derek
Ray and sitting alongside me in the
commentary box providing expert analysis
is Stuart Robson and if things go well
for them they can qualify for a
promotion match what might we see oh
surely well the keeper reacted
magnificently and eventually goalkeeper
ball well you can sense the relief
amongst his teammates but what a first
save that
was
lindegard now with Bruno wanted to keep
it but couldn't oh that's a super piece
of
Defending well you never quite know
who's going to emerge from the shadows
and become a match winner but this man
might be a decent shout what are you
expecting to see from here Stewart
Defenders Derek hate playing against
players with pace and he's got plenty of
pace to run in behind and he does it
cleverly he comes short then spins him
behind and then he's One V one against
the goalkeeper and he usually finishes
it
off good looking
ball how about the cross and he read it
well
defensively and the throw in fourth
[Applause]
coming
[Applause]
a good and fair
[Applause]
challenge
lindgard
Diaz couldn't keep
it good looking ball there could be a
chance now and denied by The Keeper
impressive released it
nicely and both hands on it good
goalkeeping oh Mistake by The
Keeper
that's not a bad ball and it wasn't
quite as good as it looked when it was
played
overy
Jonathan and a tiny
Challenge
lindegard and passing it
through
oh fine play and maybe it'll set
something up and still danger
here well clattered
away Bruno well nicely cut out now what
can they do with the
ball and options in the
center an utterly disappointing cross
goal
[Applause]
kick lindgard rewarded for that
brilliant High Press now will the cross
work out for them well thumped
clear Pino
well nothing comes of the attack when
all is said and
done now what can they do from
here well it came to nothing in the
end and the No Nonsense
clearance Diaz
Bale
lindgard promising
pass still Level here but the pressure
escalating well they couldn't keep that
sequence going
unfortunately and it crossed the touch
line so a throw in
here
Bruno that's a good looking ball the
keeper have to think about with bodies
around
him and showing the importance of
wi well disappointing end to the
move
lindegard and space to cross
it
[Applause]
and nicely over the
top oh big opportunity oh that is an
outrageously good stop well great
reflexing from The Keeper he did
brilliantly
[Applause]
there smuggled
away
space afforded
him must take the lead here and they
have you've got to say it has been
coming One n
[Applause]
then and passing it well and collected
tidily he had plenty to think
about onto
Bruno that is that for the first half
here
[Applause]
about
away they go again second half is
underway
here can he put it
away spot on with that time
tle perfect
tackle so a throw in
here
Diaz they've regained
possession foul there free kick
awarded
[Applause]
well he decided to take it on how close
it was well I thought that was coming
into the box it takes a lot of
confidence to try that not rewarded on
this occasion
though
Pino teammates
available oh this is looking promising
can they convert a smart stop here well
just getting it out of there was the
priority really and it will be a
throw good looking pass the switch of
play now
attending to his defensive
[Applause]
chores and he's got the beating of his
opponent and teammates to play it
to and it took a little Nick before it
went over the touch line so a throw in
here delivered into the area
[Applause]
here
fine cross into the middle well far from
the cross he had in mind goal kick it
is
[Applause]
Bale and credit due a good
intervention oh good defending to stop a
a decent looking
attack this is
Bruno good ball over the
top terrific piece of
anticipation really good
interception not much defensive cover
there on the
flank and angling it back and the danger
is
[Applause]
averted good through ball
they couldn't maintain
possession well the fans are driving
their team on here but can they respond
with a goal time is running
out 20 minutes to
[Applause]
go and the advantage acrs to the
attacking side happy to shoot and still
an opport
Unity now the cross was deep a little
too
deep well what a good piece of
goalkeeping that was but the equalizer
can't be long incoming
surely smuggled
away flag Rays for offside
[Applause]
now we're inside the finyl 15
minutes and a strong
tackle and do they mean business on this
occasion oh to level the match still
[Applause]
alive pressing like that will help the
cause and an effect of
clearance
very effective pass this could level it
magnificent
defending that's well
blocked
Roma not a great Challenge free kick
here
Bale and the pass not quite accurate
enough and a Thro in
then it is to be a Thro
in an important
interception
Diaz they might very well be late
excitement 5 minutes left and the margin
just one
and possession lost
[Applause]
there well they're attacking but time is
the great enemy this could Square the
game oh a challenge of the highest order
plattered
away well found wanting in the throw in
Department
there room to roam on the
wing we will have a couple of additional
minutes at the end
here this attack looks highly promising
chance to equalize oh a stem of piece of
Defending and the referee sees that as a
foul free kick given
and that is that the referee blows his
whistle for full time and it's a victory
for the visitors yes Derek there wasn't
much in it to be honest really
competitive game with chances at both
ends but they probably just about edged
it overall
[Applause]
and
I
there can be no denying it this is
crunch time the first promotion match
and no margin for error the players have
simply got to get it right out there on
the
[Applause]
pitch we'll have all the action for you
next on EA
TV
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be olling I'm Derek
Ray and I'm joined for expert analysis
by Stuart Robson and excitement levels
are high as they get ready to appear in
a promotion match for the first time how
do you see the match going Stuart yeah
it's certainly a big game today up to
now they've been really good can they
just go that little bit further and put
in an excellent performance
here
onto
Bruno clean
challenge can they take
advantage oh marvelous defending to deny
him
Bale plenty of supports here laid into
the box can he put it away here still
could be dangerous but wait a minute
that is
offside well you never quite know who's
going to emerge from the shadows and
become a match winner but this man might
be a decent shout what are you expecting
to see from him Stuart well the game
plan of the coach is to get the ball
into the front players as oh hang on
Stuart it's a
chance and it's opening up marvelous
anticipation car keys handed in at
reception a car keys and a wallet take
it away please collect them after the
game thank you and tremendous individual
skill well he's been ruled
offside
lamb options in the
middle and
offside
lindgard in behind for him to chase well
I must say it did look so promising but
the flag is raised offside the verdict
Stewart well he's just too eager there
it's the right run but he's made it too
early jamy
decent looking
pass a bit of Running Room now on the
wing and let's give credit to the
defending good through ball and whipped
into the box and everyone in the center
looking on as it sailed over
them now relying very much on their
passing game in a bid to take the lead
insufficient guile on the crossing front
you've got to say
seamons
jamy can he put them in front oh a
challenge of the highest
order
and he was in the right place to
intercept by the referee allowing the
play to
flow takes the shot can they put it
away but following the deflection a
corner kick coming up
[Applause]
here
delivering
it might work out and he might be in
here and in at the second time of asking
just what was
[Applause]
required so underway again here one n
the
score
lindgard good tackle taken
away well space for them
here could be and a fine
[Applause]
stop elects to go short
delivered into the area here and a
wretched cross really over
everyone
Rau
lindegard
[Applause]
Bale oh nice
[Applause]
ball and a throw in it's going to be
[Applause]
can he find the right
pass a fine reading of the
situation
blue couldn't find a teammate throw in
here oh yes what a pass
[Applause]

here but he made that interception look
routine in truth it
wasn't
jamy really well played

[Applause]
positioned
Roma Now options are
[Applause]
plenty onto
Bruno can she connect with her
teammate and a tidy
[Applause]
challenge that's an effective cross
aimed at the back
post one goal down but now a corner
[Applause]
kick let's see about the delivery
a chance then for the respective
managers to address their charges it is
halime
[Applause]
[Applause]
here
the away they go again second half is
underway
here went in strongly
decisively Bale and a good looking Ball
but goalkeepers ball disappointingly for
them m
excellent
Vision seamons well moving the ball
forward they might be in
business well couldn't quite Hit the
Target close though well had it been on
target I think the goalkeeper had that
one
covered
Lou and in the right position to make
sure it didn't go all the way
[Applause]
through
seamons
jamy the attack looks
promising spot on with that tackle
[Applause]
lindegard
mialik
Lam

and it will be a throw in
here
romal 30 minutes left for
play and coly done in the
end and scope for them to produce
something
exciting
jamy and players waiting on the center
well punched Away by The
[Applause]
Keeper headed over towards the back post
nicely
blocked
but a good place to win it back and
let's see what it leads to able to close
down the shot they won't complain about
having won the corner and maybe an
opportunity to increase their
[Applause]
advantage this is
Bruno nice looking
pass can he play it in opportunity to
level it and you've got to credit that
magnificent piece of
Defending well the host have had so much
of the ball in the last 15 minutes
creating lots of chances now and oh
shers a chance oh a challenge that
simply had to be
won oh that's a super piece of
Defending chance to attack using wit
breaking at PACE
is it going to be no way through
perfectly Fair tackle and it will be a
[Applause]
corner playing it
in and that a piece of goalkeeping
you're going to see again and again and
[Applause]
again trying to deliver it
accurately well the bar can be the
goalkeeper's best
friend well they're so unlucky not to be
level now it was a great effort you just
wonder if they're going to regret that
yes a really open flow to the game end
to endend
stuff the
delivery and clears the
danger it's a perfect
challenge and space to attack well no
time to waste can they find an
equalizer well clattered
away Gerard well they have the advantage
that's good
refereeing lamb pass after pass happy to
just keep possession and frustrate their
opponents and foul it is
then
now what can they produce on the flank
well it came to nothing in the
end so approaching the final whistle and
the visitors on course to lose narrowly
here Stuart what have you made of it
well it's been tight but they've lacked
a cut in Edge they've done well at the
back and in Midfield but the final pass
the shot or cross have lacked that bit
of quality can they find that Missing
Link in these final this they must score
oh a stellar piece of
Defending well they're attacking but
time is the great enemy and the keepers
delighted to see that sail well over the
bar goal
kick and it cross the touch line so a
throw in
here
lamb well adding up all the stoppages we
will have two extra minutes
lamb and played in with
haste smuggled
[Applause]
away and that was will be all for this
game anyway and defeat for the visitors
much to the disappointment of their
[Applause]
supporters
