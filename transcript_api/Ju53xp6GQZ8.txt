Young
[Music]
[Music]
t
[Music]
forever
everever I'mma be
great and a warm welcome on what is a i
deal night for football you've got to
say I'm Derek Ray and my commentary
partner as always is Stuart Robson and
there's plenty to play for because we're
at the semi-final stage of the UEA
Europa conference league and this is the
second leg it's haiduk split up against
Tottenham Hotspur well Derek the first
game was full of quality so let's hope
this one is just as good Spurs hold that
slight Advantage but if they don't play
at their best today they could come
unstuck
here this is is the starting lineup for
Tottenham hbur Ugo laice begins in goal
davington Sanchez plays alongside khu
kibali in central defense Pierre emier
plays with Rodrigo banur in the center
of Midfield and they line up with just
the one Striker looking to do a bit of
damage now what can they do from
here well Visionary passing and just
missing the target whether at making
chances now they need to be more
clinical
KUSI banur with
it well you never quite know who's going
to dominate a game in advance but I
think you can maybe make an argument for
this fellow Stuart what do you think
we'll see from him today well what a
goal scorer he is he's finishing oh
they've got to score and a goal and I'll
tell you what that gives them a bit of a
cushion
now well I have to say this is a really
good goal he skips past his marker and
that gives him the space to get his shot
away excellent stuff from him just to
check on the aggregate score it is
[Applause]
2-0
hiier
[Applause]
KUSI it is a decent looking attack
here
hiier and he did what he had to do
[Applause]
defensively oh they've lost it
Philip krovinovic
[Applause]
options in the
center putting his body on the
line could be
dangerous it wasn't a great pass was
it
son
[Applause]
son and the danger
cleared and unable to keep
[Applause]
possession
can they get in behind
them and space to cross it cross
[Applause]
blocked who can they pick
out
hiier well the threat the referee
spotted the infringement and it will be
a free kick in a position of genuine
Menace
[Applause]
rifled against the post but back in
play cleared away
comprehensively well they won't come
much closer than that it's a matter of
inches from being a really good goal
well having been denied by the woodwork
now the focus is on keeping the
opposition at
Bay really a very poor
ball well Spurs now in potentially a
dangerous position a disappointing end
to the
move
[Applause]
kalinich Dean
kuluski
hiier and they know they need to stop
him well the pass not finding its Target
hiier in
position well what an opportunity but
really good defending you've got to
say oh he looks threatening will he
finish and a goal that's his brace they
just can't keep him
quiet well you just feel it might be
getting away from them 3-0 on
Aggregate
kalinich and the quality of pass needs
to be a bit
[Applause]
better
hir
Benton well there to
intercept
[Applause]
kalinich galdo with
it
son not a play for a Spurs
throwing so making the substitution now
he
and return to
son just not looking confident in
[Applause]
possession krovinovic
[Applause]
now with
levaya and he was in the right place to
intercept the referee has decided there
will be just one minute of added time
[Applause]
galdo and so it is the first half story
has been
[Music]
written well underway once more and it's
going to be fascinating to see what
developments occur in this second half
[Applause]
targets available cross comes
in well threat
[Applause]
averted well he could really get at the
opposition really poor timing and some
will argue that he was asking for a
yellow card
well he's gone into the book well he was
late and he deserved a booking for
that beautiful
pass can they
convert well I think you could call that
an escape it looked a certain and
[Applause]
goal can he
finish oh and it goes now he has his
hattick a special moment for
him well here is again and just look how
he turns away from his marker and then
gets his shot away that's a very good
goal you have to say well it's turned
into a runaway on Aggregate
[Applause]
4-0
grinovich and with that the attack
Fizzles
[Applause]
out and the Counterattack is on options
available till they have the guile to
open up the
a glorious chance a goal and I'll tell
you what on this sort of form very few
would lay a glove on
them well here it is again and I don't
expect Keepers to save everything at
their near post but I think he should
probably do better he'll be a little bit
disappointed with that they got to land
punches when there's this sort of golf
in quality 5 n the aggregate
score
[Applause]
fatti
Spence
Martinez given away by
Tottenham Marco
[Applause]
Laya
and H with
it well we always enjoy bringing you
live action on eatv and Premier League
action coming up it's Tottenham Hotspur
facing
brenford showing teamwork and
commitment getting
forward this could pose problems for the
Defenders what a save well let's see
what they have in store for them on the
break well it looked highly promising
but it came to nothing in the
[Applause]
end Philip
[Applause]
kovich he takes aim a smart stop
here time for a change then
let's see about the delivery relatively
straightforward to mop up
defensively well read to win possession
[Applause]
back
Hunter just 20 minutes remaining
now counterattacking very much an
option
[Applause]
levaya krovinovic
Philip krovinovic
[Applause]
difficult to stop him but the danger
averted for
now
[Applause]
son
oh there it is it's one goal after
another and it speaks to the quality of
their
performance well here you can see it
again good run great strength and a
composed finish Under Pressure that's a
top class goal and this has become an
absolute thrashing 60 is the aggregate
[Applause]
score Marco Laya and he was in the right
place to intercept racing forward trying
to catch them
out Giovani
loela it's there for him there it is a
fantastic goal and no wonder he's off
celebrating well here it is again it was
a good finish but the keeper has to do
better at his near post he was beaten
far too easily on that occasion
well that's an out and out pacting 6
n 10 minutes left for
play Dario
mnak and he read it well intercepting
[Applause]
it lovely ball over the top
Martinez
takes the shot able to get a body in the
[Applause]
way Marco
Laya well nicely cut out now what can
they do with the
[Applause]
ball
regon and a good challenge to bring that
attack to an
end krovinovic
good looking
[Applause]
sequence really important piece of last
ditch
[Applause]
defending one minutes of stoppage time
has been added
on
and now the referee blows his whistle
and Spurs are going to the final but
what a good win that was over the two
games they're
[Applause]

the scene here in North London I'm Derek
Ray in the commentary position and
alongside me is the former Arsenal and
West Ham Midfield player Stuart Robson
and very much looking forward to
bringing you action from the Premier
League it is Tottenham Hotspur versus
Nottingham Forest well thanks Derek the
best coach I've played under that would
always tell us before kickoff earn the
right to play if you can win your
individual battles outrun your opponent
eventually you'll get oh what an
opportunity well he needed to read it to
get there and
[Applause]
did well Spurs really want to win this
game after being held to a draw in their
last match against brenford how do you
think this one will go sters well in a
tight game the draw wasn't necessarily a
bad result but if they show a little bit
more energy going forward today they can
certainly win this
one well quite simply Spurs have the
best home record in the league not easy
being a visiting side here Stewart well
15 wins from 16 games shows how
difficult they are to play against
because they play at such a good Tempo
both with and without the ball I'm not
sure today will be any
different trying to deliver it
accurately oh cleared off the line alert
defending Casper
dolberg lingard he's been wasteful with
the ball
here Dean
[Applause]
kuski
O'Brien now
lingard
lingard making his way
forward well a really single-minded
piece of Defending to make sure nothing
un to
happen and news of a goal at the King
Power Stadium Alex Scott it's a goal for
Chelsea it was a poor poor clearance and
it was far too easy for him after that
they've scored the opener with 13
minutes played Alex with the info as
ever
Dean
kuluski it's with
chalano promising move from
[Applause]
Tottenham
chanu real chance and a goal now they've
broken through one n
here well here we can see it again it's
all about the pace of the passing one
tou slick movement and the Finish is
clinical it just makes it look so easy
doesn't he
now the ball is moving once more how
important will that opening goal prove
to
[Applause]
be
KUSI well the fans are begging for a
shot and he's certainly in the mood for
his second well he's certainly looking a
threat he looks so sharp
today who can he pick out it hasn't come
to very much
[Applause]
son Splendid defending and it needed to
be Thor and denied by The Keeper
[Applause]
impressive who can they pick
out the corner kicks keep on
[Applause]
coming not away completely
[Applause]
mageot attemped super
block
beond and
lingard well they want that equalizer
but the passing remains
smooth and he read it
[Applause]
superbly Pont
now that's a well-timed pass full credit
wonderful
[Applause]
stop a really Sumptuous ball and tosing
through can they slot it home
Chi and it's a double for him in this
game no way for the oppos position to
contain him and no wonder he's off
celebrating so the ball rolling again at
[Applause]
2-0 Beyond
[Applause]
deck well they've given him too much
space
[Music]
lingard it's with
Pon wilting under the pressure and now
they try to go
[Applause]
forward
KUSI
Hunter well as you can see Spurs have
completely controlled The Possession and
have used it really well today
particularly in the Midfield areas and I
expect more of the same as the game goes
on oh sure they might be on to something
here oh good
[Applause]
save over it
[Applause]
comes
lingard Casper dolberg this might be
ideal for the
counter keeper had work to
do and he's fired over the
corner cleared away compr
[Applause]
apprehensively
[Music]
lingard and the cross into the middle
well nothing productive
[Applause]
really and Forest recovering possession
[Applause]
well and out of play the pass nearly
worked out but not
quite
hung
minson
Hunter and H beard with it indicated
there will be and just one minute of
time added on for
stoppages that is that for the first
half
here
[Music]
and the second half has started here at
the home of
[Applause]
Spurs
pavier
now
son
[Applause]
chanu patient enough buildup can they
carve out a chance oh surely well the
keeper is Happy the bar was there no
nonsense
clearance well how did that not go in it
was a great effort you have to say but
it should boost their confidence they
can't afford to drop their guard at the
other end and just failing to bend the
run enough and the flag has been
raised and it is substitution time at
this juncture not just from one side but
from
both davington
Sanchez
chanu will it be well the challenge was
clean but the danger not
cleared well well quite rightly all
roads lead to Wembley on FA Cup final
day and you'll be able to see the action
live with us right here on eatv it's
Tottenham Hotspur taking on Chelsea well
that's always a great occasion the
atmosphere will be electric and the two
teams will be desperate to lift that
cup and a very good
[Applause]
challenge
Spence it's with
chalano
[Applause]
chalano
Hunter and it goes a three-goal cushion
and you truly sense it's a matter of how
many well we won't get tired of watching
this because the interplay around the
box is wonderful and then the shot is
emphatic he strikes it with such power
the keeper has no time to react what a
good
finish this is looking rather
comfortable for them 3
n subti for to H coming off theit number
23 and with that the attack Fizzles
out number 18 Giovani L Giovanni
loela
and winning it
back and the friendly reminder that we
have more action from the Premier League

knock it around inside their own
half
Hunter they certainly allowing their
opponents to come on to
them hiier beautifully disguised
ball and in the perfect position to read
it and into the last 20 minutes
bodies forward and the break looks
on till they have the guile to open up
the
defense well nothing comes of it it
looked
promising
son
Hunter
Lelo might be able to set up the
[Applause]
chance Giovani
Lelo magnificent challenge to win it
back well there's been a change to the
