Anthony not a huge chunk of added time
one minute and he's got the beating of
his
opponent manester United know they've
got to be precise with the corner given
the
circumstances well both teams have had
substitute swarming up and now both will
rely on their respective
[Applause]
benches delivering it a great
clearance qu thinking
defensively well that's it for the 90
minutes but this is not over and two
15minute periods of extra time to
[Applause]
come substitution for Aston
Villa so back in business here the first
period of extra time and it might well
come down to mental fortitude who wants
this
more but he's certainly not

much
[Applause]
fuss Diego

defending in the end and danger reverted
for
now and the electronic board showing one
additional
minute and the first period of extra
time comes to an end still Level
[Applause]
here well extra time continues we're
into the second period now to
be number
CHR
Anthony still passing it around with
authority superbly read and
executed well the counter chance looks
very real
still pushing for a
winner a chance to whip it in
Kamar he read the situation defensively
and did his
job well five minutes remaining in this
second period of extra
[Applause]
time took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
them all play nicely nicely over the
top T the man must take the lead
[Applause]
here making sure nothing on to happened
superb tackle a final that will live
long in the memory it's not finished yet
because it's going to come down to a
penalty shooter to settle the
up and so they penalty shoot out about
to commence and as a player well he's
gone for finesse and it's really paid
off it did strike the post but it's a
goal and he steps up to take the
shot and that is when you need your
goalkeeper goalkeeper beaten from the
spot and up he comes doing his best to
remain
focused and it wasn't the greatest
penalty and it's been saved by the
keeper and he
scores you want to pressure cooker this
is it he must
score and he finds the net he could
hardly miss a goal now and his team will
prevail
and there it is that brings it to a
conclusion and a contrast in emotions
one team joyful the other absolutely
devastating well what drama what scenes
and what a good finish to this game it
really has been exhilarating well in
football you don't forget these moments
in a hurry due reward for their
persistence and their overall Excellence
when it really has been engrossing today
such a tight game that you have to feel
sorry for the losers they were so close
but yet so far away and the party moon
has ined the stadium it's going to be
quite the night of Celebration
