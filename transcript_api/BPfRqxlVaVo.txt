one a lot that was easily my favorite
one so far that one was really [ __ ]
good azir descent into the tomb the
tragic fall of sherea was nothing
compared to the tragedy of its rise from
the
grave in a market on the edge of the
desert a stranger
appears
copia a noble woman of noxus looking to
hire a guide to take her to the fabled
lost
city but not just any guide she hires
the owner of a legendary ancient Blade
the mercenary called
civer civer gathers her band of cell
swords and they set out into the desert
to find the Buri bones of
sherea 5 days
beneath the broiling Sun a scout spots
Towers jutting from the
dunes and a Stairway leading
underground they climb down into the
darkness ancient Treasures gleam in the
torch light even civer is astonished at
the Grandeur of the
ruins her men head deeper in only to
stumble into tra
house and be
[Music]
eviscerated civer is stunned with horror
but copia does not flinch she sees only
the statue of a huge serpent silently
guarding the door to the Tomb of the
Emperors it sounds like a
[ __ ] campaign doesn't it the ancient
weapon is a key
copia betrays
civer she picks up civer blade puts it
into the
Rock The guardian's Curse is triggered
the stone serpent Comes Alive it pins
copia and its
jaws the Venom seals her flesh like
acid the tomb door opens reaon emergy
the brother I loved and locked away
Twisted Beyond Insanity followed by Zar
architect of this
torment my failure is
complete civa drags herself away life
blood flooding from her
wound and then
succumbs to Darkness
behold shara's
Legacy I don't have a goddamn [ __ ] what
any of that just meant I feel like it
would mean more to me if I knew who the
hell these people
were but I guess that was just like a
little bit of back story I don't know
the next one is called azir rise of the
ascended when did Riot Ender ever change
their logo from this as CER lies
betrayed and bleeding something
incredible occurs for those she does not
know it civer is the last in the
bloodline of
A's lost Emperor and as her blood soaks
into the ancient Sands a deep magic
Sparks to
life
Resurrection first Air's mind then his
body snatched back from Oblivion to be
reborn
[Music]
then he sees CER wanders at her face he
sees himself in this daughter of
sherea in that moment he has no thought
of Empires or rituals he only knows she
needs his help he must take her to the
Oasis of the Dawn the mother of
life he smells the waters
smells of
life he Praises in
time he does not dream that he shara's
greatest Emperor can at long last earn
his Ascension and bring back his Broken
City he dares not dream that if he can
save her azir can save them
all
[Music]
[Music]

many say I hold too much
power
others say I can't be
trusted maybe they're
right but the only Power I truly
have is the
strength to Let It

it it's taken years for the spirit
blossoms to return if the land is ready
to heal perhaps you are as
well and this is the
way

enough
