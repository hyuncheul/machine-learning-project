valerant is about to drop the best skins
we've ever seen the Konami bundle was
just revealed and it looks absolutely
insane this bundle will include a vandal
Sheriff Spectre Marshall and of course a
melee these skins seem to be ninja
themed and have some of the best pullout
and reload animations I think we've ever
seen not to mention the finisher which
I'm going to let speak for it
[Music]
self the whole map turns into a rainy
thunderstorm and the somber tone is just
beautiful these skins will have four
variants which are the default blue the
purple reever style the all white and of
course the all black with hints of red
all around these are some of the coolest
skins I've ever seen and I'll for sure
be picking up this bundle let me know
what you guys think
