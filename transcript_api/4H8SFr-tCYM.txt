[Music]
we travel the Journey of our
Liv take another
picture before we say
goodbye arm and arm
standing stand side by
side memories fade but legends never die
one last time let's live for something I
can feel my blood it's rushing this
ain't goodbye we'll be back
someday and we will find our own
way take control of our
F and like a car with no
break crushing BL make
mistakes and we'll be back one day
[Music]
we'll be back one
[Music]
day I don't never really want to hold
back I got dreams when to go fast no
this here the last not a glass half full
overflow that got to keep your eyes up
on the priz only got one life so it's
worth a try if find one makes you feel
alive that's the only way to live it
right
on and never we're all doing our own
things but I'll never forget our Glory
Days my mind is full of the memories
yeah and I'll never forget what they
meant to me don't worry we'll be back
one day just celebrate our Glory Days
on
[Music]
we'll be back one
[Music]
day although it's over now don't let it
get you
down we'll be back around around
[Music]
now we can feel some sorrow a new day it
starts tomorrow we'll wake up new dreams
to follow a new goal and brand new
Mel last time let's live for something I
can feel my blood it's rushing this
ain't goodbye we'll be back
someday and we will find our a way
take control of our
face and like a car with no
face crushing make
mistakes and we'll be back one
day we'll be back one
day
we'll be back one
[Music]
