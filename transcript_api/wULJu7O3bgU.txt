oh my life Welcome in chat welcome in
Bells hope you're doing good we're try
and talk a bit quieter um I need to put
turn my microphone up I will
do I think I should be
okay just going to try and speak a bit
softer and take like less deep breaths
as well um as the pinned comment reads I
owe a lot to Elliot and s
um like over the last few days of
whatever like cold virus this is is
really beating me up welcoming Ken
um so I've uh I got sent home from work
Thursday which I think was the last day
that I streamed tried to go to work
yesterday and I was just having none of
it like so I got sent home yesterday as
well um I should have been on work today
but I've had the day off
off um I've got a normal day off
tomorrow and then I'm back in work on
Monday so fingers
crossed um I start to pick up tomorrow
but yeah I've been really really rough
um so apologies you know for missing the
end of the team of the year I mean In
fairness I would have missed it anyway
because of work um we got through our
packs you know we we went into Team of
the Year with like what was it around
400 packs I think um thank you so much
for the 37 months by the way bells I do
really really appreciate
it
um but yeah we uh we we had like what
300 400 packs um and you know recycled
that we managed to get ourselves van djk
um Elliot got us did Elliot get us out
of
I think um we got Trent as well sebb
went on to the account Sab got us
Kane honestly just insane stuff um but
yeah we've got
a if I do this we'll be able to see what
the guy got us um over the next few days
we'll have Clips Tik Tok uh and YouTube
shorts coming out of what the guys open
for me and what they managed to get me
if you don't yet follow uh the Tik Tok
by the way way we've just reached a
thousand followers over there welcome in
baggies hope you're doing good
um oh he got CBA Sab even got celba done
for us oh Sab you absolute Jem absolute
Jem yeah seven Elliot's links are both
pinned uh in the pinned comment if you
want to go and check them out drop them
a follow on socials if you can I'd
really really appreciate it guys oh that
is
wonderful that is just wonderful I think
Cela has to come in over com for me um
he just he just has to he just has
to
Kane I might pop in over uh
Vol for the time
being and let me just see how we're
doing on the sound
desktop audio is okay isn't it like
music's okay it's not too loud I know I
am a little bit quiet I am trying to be
a little bit on the quiet side so just
bear with me there but yeah 37 months
get me an MP for my service deserve mate
deserve uh Elliot also got us um Bon
Pastor as well
who to be fair probably could could well
end up pushing Kai habit out I might
give her a go at some point for sure um
I'm going to do is take rice Off the
Bench um what a bench we now have by the
way
absolutely stuff that dreams are made of
isn't it really really is
um yeah wow just followed you on Tik Tok
I appreciate it I I'll make sure I drop
you a follow
back uh when I go on later but um yeah
if anyone has any ideas of what kind of
content you'd like to see me do uh live
on Tik Tok then let me know um I could
try streaming for sure but I'm not 100%
certain
yet yeah
car
um I'm might just
keep in the reserves for the time being
um welcoming Oscar as well and I think
vet has to be on there over salanki as
well but yeah the way that the team has
evolved um over timia is is
absolutely absolutely
incredible some really really good pools
in there
um yeah really really
proud
really really
pleased this gives me a bit of a
headache because obviously Granite
doesn't get in on chemistry
anymore whether or not I tried B
Camp I'm not too
sure I think L's
cheek doesn't even get chemistry
either
right and I do need that sort of more
defensive type
midfielder this might be you know what
we look into doing next I
think and he's got a little bit because
of Kane being in there
if I take out the manager
actually and I put in a Swiss
manager we should be
okay welcome in uh VAP hope you're doing
okay got Europa League player out of 85
Plus pick got the worst one Amon team of
the week uh or Kim you should I take um
it's up to you
like you got the worst
one uh legal chemistry should I
take yeah it's it's kind of your
decision really Kean
like if nothing gets in your team then
maybe just go for
rating and try it that
way so that's got him up to two cam now
which I think I can deal
with
um just de bit in on if to play bur Camp
over OD
God bur Camp's got better Pace but not
as good shooting which absolutely
baffles me uh OD God's Better
dribbler B Camp seems slightly
better I think if we put an engine on
him
we could give it a go can't we and then
if needs be we can always switch back I
mean this bur Camp was actually free as
well in this season which is ever so
slightly disappointing but never
mind but I think putting an engine on
him would probably be
best
um
I'm just going to whack a hunter on Kane
I'm not going to lie thank you to those
of you whove dropped a like on the
stream already as well got 14 of the
weeks
Fair
a shadow on vanik
imagine going to go for it got a m Evo
base for uh for
fallan uh fallan gives double play sty
plus
Fair yeah I've seen that new Evo that's
came out looks all right
actually like a cat on
Edison yeah I'm kind of trying to put my
best players in to be fair that's what
I'm attempting right now and players
that I want to use as
well I know celba is like slightly less
rated than Coman but I think he'll be
better I think out of the two Smith is
just slightly better than than vaa and
Kane has to come in
undoubtedly
um I
would try Bon pastor but I do really
really like that H it so I'm going to
going to stick with
him what number is Trent is he
66
sorry yeah he h number 66 I thought
so no I don't like dumbbell for mate
I don't like them
byly
maybe number
14 number does van dijke
play is he number four or is he a number
six or something in
between you where it's number four I
thought it
was demele is a very very overrated card
I will say he's literally just all Pace
he's got no end product whatsoever I've
used him a bunch of times 185 goals 7
185 games sorry 71 goals 73 assists um
he was great when I first packed him but
he really really really went to
downhill really went
downhill I feel like they just nerfed
this
card he's very good dribbling wise but
his end product is just
shocking absolutely
shocking am I happy with the and that I
will possibly make changes to this as
well as I you know use some of the new
cards that we've got five car yeah
literally
recommend Yashin 92 I'm a hate to break
it to you but I'm a first owner RTG I
don't I don't buy
Cards
um yeah so many good cards here that I
would love to try out
midar um mcabe that orber as well to be
fair but all in good time all in good
time
lafel looks good yeah he does to be
fair
but there we have it uh what Evo where
we doing we've got 31 packs to get
through as
well we're finishing off the Kofi B got
16 days to get him done which is fine
we've got a theme Pursuit as well um
also play Four we played two another
clean sheet that's
fine so we will manage to get that done
all be in
while 31 packs to get through not sure
if to save packs for the next promo now
cuz this road to the final one doesn't
really excite me much I'm not going to
lie it really really doesn't so I might
just hold on to packs and um I did say
that I'd rip them open but I might just
hold on to what we've got and then
uh get that sorted I
think and tonight we can actually just
play some games you know get themed
Pursuit out of the way done
um do evos in the meantime as well and
maybe do you know what I really want to
do to be honest I I really just want to
um
I really just want to get some
Rivals team is looking very blue but in
the best way possible where my where my
Dynamics
at there we go there we
go oh we've come a long
way so so happy with this
I'd love to get another little Evo on to
me as well incredible card absolutely
incredible card 220 games she's played
for me now 98 goals 77 assists as
well huge huge
card right then have
anticipation pack yeah I just I just
look at this promo and I think I might
open like the odd pack here and there
but honestly M just what we got there's
um a play of pick out is in there so I
might get that done played FIFA since
2006 I bought FIFA the first game I
remember playing was FIFA
2003 um and I've I've played every
single one since
then
but yeah I think the the next promo uh
from what I've seen is the Future Stars
One which could have some really nice
cards in it um so I may just save packs
for that now actually going going back
on the title do apologize

of this SBC to be honest we'll keep it
it's got a day left on it
n completed the tour nice
got B water B
Fair let's
preview fair enough not bad not
bad yeah what are the possibilities Jam
will get for
um for future
stars it's kind of sad isn't it that we
we're into one promo and we're already
talking about the next one done both at
no mat I've I've only spent 28 minutes
on this account I've I've not sat at my
desk since
Thursday
um so yeah I thought we do a
little little Ultimate Team grind now I
just really wanted to try the team out
to be honest really wanted to get into
some
games
yeah I don't think they'll do like more
than one per club though
though like your biggest young Talent at
the minute are is it co Kobe
Mayo uh Cole Palmer Oscar Bob
definitely I I can't remember the
Liverpool lad's name but I know he is
playing very
well
um those are sort of your main ones at
the m
yeah there'll be some in the women's uh
women's league as well for
sure maybe we'll get two teams M
hopefully that would be nice to get a a
men's team and a women's team you know
more
content that would be
lovely Conor Bradley it was it is
Bradley yeah I did get that right then I
didn't know his first name I thought his
name was
Bradley but yeah him
um some like Championship cards would be
nice you know maybe like a job it' be
lovely be great if they could include
job and a Jacob would be jet meate if
they included job we'd have to
like
give Jacob J Jacob Jacob some ventalin
or
something he would be gassed absolutely
GED but I doubt it I I doubt that they'd
include that maybe they will with him
being judee's
brother they do quite like
Jude so yeah hopefully what about Barca
Ro roale any any players in the this any
like young you know Spanish
um Spanish league maybe German league
French league young talents as well
maybe um mbappe is mbappe's uh little is
it his little brother is he in the game
yet BR Camp guys with Cru
and three midfielders on Deadline day
let's
go bought mbappe fair enough
B yamal okay
okay my mind just goes blank like I
think it's a lot of I won't lie like a
lot of my focus is always around Premier
League
um championship in in League one I I
don't even follow League 2 anymore I
probably will be next season
if they'll Carry On Doing how they're
doing don't forget the Italian league as
well Mak yeah yeah maky
possibly I think it will be quite
heavily Prem oriented cuz I have to say
like we do really well with our
youngsters um as a whole in it as a
collective in the Premier
League JN yes okay
okay
oh
whatever happened to chavy Simmons by
the way like where is he playing these
days kid had like so much so much
Prospect and then I've just not heard of
him this season not seeing his name
about anywhere this
season B yeah
possibly
liic how is he doing
there maybe I'm just out of touch I
don't know but I've just not heard much
from
him so much praise around him smashing
it light light sorry fa play fair
play
I think he's had a future stars before
hasn't
he he's not very old though is he really
young
[Music]
lad yeah fair enough M possibly finish
thank you
Harry they should do like the opposite
of a future stars as well do like
a you
know players that are like approaching
retirement kind of
thing oh I saw that um f is it Fellaini
I think has retired from football
today possibly get a flashback
SPC
veteran Stars yeah something like
that saying that you know that they
Chuck Messi and Ronaldo into that don't
you
[Music]
yeah lus are doing well I hope they pull
it off K be part of it
yeah leandi I I think comes to mind
mainly guy was an absolute
unit Big Boy Ben basically like all the
players in MLS and Saudi that have just
ruined their career well not ruined the
careers but you know gone to
retirement there that young lad there
was it jotter or something like that
went to play in Saudi and he just
regretted it straight away happened with
hendo as well isn't it Jordan
Henderson he's back now too yeah
okay you could chuck a couple of like
icons into it as well I mean like all
the icons had qualify under the
circumstances but you
know Silver Star I missed that I
actually missed they ruined Silver Stars
last FIFA like FIFA 23 silver stars were
[ __ ] FIFA
22 Silver Stars was so good really
decent cuz
like even for like Team of the Year
you'd have like a silver stars Team of
the Year like 74 rated but just
absolutely cracked
cards so
good they should bring that
back it was just fun I loved doing my
weekly silver
stars extra packs in there as
well plain sailing it
was Thiago silver and kante yeah Thiago
Silva is actually a goat so so
underrated that people don't appreciate
like I know Chelsea see it struggling
but a f good
effort I wouldn't say Man City suck
now they lost a couple of good players
but City always just buy the
time
if Liverpool start running out of steam
City will be
there got how many penalties have I had
this game I'm not complaining
but yeah I still think you'll do it m I
still think you'll do it
challenge
alen
yeah mors went to Saudi didn't he gin
obviously at bar
so but yeah City definitely don't
suck at
all
but I will I'll never rate the AI League
I'm sorry I
just it's just chucking money at players
that uh it's it's just an easy way out
for
players
trying out some of them new
cards been a decent game this by the way
my defending has been really poor
but big
save yeah if anyone hasn't checked the
pinned
comment make sure you uh do so go and
show Elliot and sebb some love for uh
keeping the packs going recycle in the
packs
Jesus
safe thank you
Edison yeah I got all my Clips edited
today if you're a member you'll be able
to watch the shorts uh as and when
they're being
uploaded everybody else they'll just
come uh usually at midday most days
I try and upload my
shorts but you can also watch them uh
straight away on Tik Tok as well
exclamation M Tik Tok feel free to drop
me a follow on there we've recently hit
1K followers over on there um yeah Tik
Tok grind has been pretty good uh just
want some ideas uh from people on what
kind of live content you know you'd like
to see on the Tik Tok cuz with Tik Tok
I'm very very mixed Tik Tok is very sort
of you know I upload all my Clips on
there but it's also very behind the
scenes as well so I'm thinking of kind
of taking that you know behind the
scenes
aspect uh with my lives as well maybe
just doing some just talking lives maybe
some watch along parties uh on there as
well and and bits like that I'm thinking
um I don't necessarily want to stream
gameplay like you know do a stream like
this onto Tik Tok um cuz I just think
I'm already doing that here I'd rather
Tik Tok be just something a bit
different
Maybe
oh my
god oh his players are falling over each
other Naro win in the end
though he managed to pull a couple of
goals back to be fair we were playing
sailing at one point but we'll take
it
sh
yeah we go Champs to
go no you can't rule City out for the
title
yet you just don't rule City
out yeah don't get frustrated with each
other though please
calm it down a
bit
wait is he using lone TZ did I see that
right fair enough got to do what you got
to do I suppose
oh that's a really really bad
pass
big
save oh I co got a last minute goal

Yuki and I think you were just getting
annoyed oh my God [ __ ] off with your
lone
TS [ __ ] sake that's annoying that's a
head loss right there I know but I'm not
sitting through that absolutely slapped
up by lone
TS unreal absolutely unreal

ridiculous oh I've just read your
message Bells by the way in the group

absolutely dunked
on
horrific well van dijk's been
underwhelming
great
challenge

really should have done better
there
yeah I feel like the
crossbar um or woodwork is is
coming I just can't put a tackle
in can't put a tackle in at all
right if we're going to just keep
waffling and chat guys I will put slow
mode on I'm just seeing a lot of
comments that don't really make sense
I'm not going to
lie especially while I'm playing Champs
qualifiers as
well a no that's an L that is a major L
right
there come
on keep pushing keep
pushing
offside [ __ ] how would she miss
that that's got to be a goal

hope you're doing good
Ryan finish that oh my God hurry hurry
hurry hurry hurry
hurry oh he's shaky
now I hate to do it to him but you got
to do what you got to
do it's a lovely finish it's a sweaty
goal but it's a nice little finish from
Smith me is just been absolutely
clattered
there looks like
he's stopped
playing
wow yeah do guess it will be fun
though getting that Leon uh R to the
final I'd go for it
yeah give it a go could be worth picking
up there's um a geog gasa one that I
well mode that I played with I think it
was James James Baker and um me James
Jack and I think Seb want to say Seb
joined us for a bit and it was like
football stadiums that was a good one it
was like
European you start to like try and guess
but it was pretty good to be
fair
welcome
Jacob
sorry I'll get
there welcome in Jacob there you go I'll
repeat
myself a good
goal come
on
ran straight into him who is that
Robinson work out who he
is very
good
oh finish that is Harry that is some
finish that is
Harry TR account with the name uh don't
pay attention to it oh Trey yeah
Trey he's um he's a bit of a
muppet he's
like the equivalent of you know somebody
from Arsenal fan TV he just it's just
one of them it's just all for clicks and
likes at the end of the day
okay oh I've got really bad lag could do
without lag could we I'm going to pause
the game I've got bad
lag uh with regards to merch by the way
I do have that page I will still be
keeping that merch page um
but I've uh just become partner uh with
a company I'm actually their first ever
partner
um they are primarily a uh like
controller grips and like controller
access accessories like kind of company
um but they are looking to Branch out um
and yeah they are they're going to be
selling some T-shirts uh for me with my
logo on so I'll have like a little just
like a little bit of a uh my own sort of
site on their
page uh with
them um and yeah you'll be able to get a
shaker as well and I'd imagine they'll
that you know pricing wise hopefully uh
will come down also I I have got a
discount code uh on there as well but
once the page is all up and official
I'll talk more about it then we'll get a
commands we'll get you know links and
stuff in the chat then um but they are
uh yeah they're on Twitter um if you
want to check them out and have a bit of
a nose so they go by the name pure
grips um and I'll put their Link in the
chat if anyone wants to check them out
um I say you don't have to just if you
want to have a nose um and uh my code is
Barber so it's basically my channel name
uh without the numbers and that gets you
a uh a 5% off um but yeah that's
them and your code is barar if you want
to check them out controller grips are
actually really really handy to have
um I'll be getting some shortly um with
my new Shaker and my new t-shirt as well
with the logo on and stuff um I think
they gave me like five sets of grips so
I might even give away some of the sets
of grips if any of you guys want some
um so yeah uh another it's pretty good
really it's they that sort of approached
me and I was like yeah sure like I'm I'm
always up
for um you know collabing with other
companies and working with companies as
well and it's it's nice and exciting to
be not only be approach but yeah they
were kind of like we want to make you
sort of like one of the main faces of
our
um of our brand and I was like let's go
for it
um yeah everything got announced on I
think it was yesterday actually it was
yesterday I need to be careful here cuz
it is only 32 I'm just going to try and
concentrate on my game and I will catch
up with the chat in a
minute just wanted that lag to disparate
a bit cuz
it's not
handy yeah that Robinson's really tided
up really tided up at the back for my
opponent
sorry um PS games are
[Music]
brilliant went a retro game sale uh in
Le to today and bought some PS2 games
sounds
banging that's absolutely
banging I will try demele but I'm
telling you he's just a pace Merchant
for me he's very good at getting past
people but his end product is
shocking Mason Holgate is probably the
first player to lose 5 nil on his debut
in the same season Sunderland 5- nil uh
against Southampton and the Sheffield
Villa game that was crazy you know
absolute
Massacre absolute
Massacre but yeah I play I think
PlayStation 2 like when I think to get
back to gaming and like my happiest day
is gaming PlayStation 2 era the
PlayStation 2 era was just unmatched
wasn't
it
Grand Theft Auto 3 running around as
clawed I remember
that even though it's not my favorite
Grand Theft Auto it's just so nostalgic
it's like my introduction to Grand Theft
Auto absolutely incredible GTA VI city
for5 pound oh my god let's go Simpson
hit and run yes I remember when Jacob
streamed
that oh The Nostalgia did you ever play
True Crime New York City that was that
was one of my favorite games on the
PS2 Pez obviously Pez and FIFA I used to
have
both so so
good Tomb Raider um James Bond Who start
the James Bond
games then belly scores now I swear to
go I've been slagging you off doesn't
that just always happen though and
slagging him off and he goes on a a run
and
scores stand by it Beth me it's clear
he's just good as a super sub I
think
great
challenge oh I'm
lucky there we go
42 simplest game based on the film is
also on Nintendo
nice yeah feel free to send your Team
Jacob we can have a look at
it uh GTA griso gr turism I played that
a lot as well I played like a motocross
game as well um
that was I loved that game was really
really
good let me have a look if I can find it
si I used to love like moto moto sport
games um
PS2 most across
games I don't know if I'd recognize the
cover if I saw it I'd recognize the game
play MX Superfly like it might have been
that you
know that looks
familiar I think it was MX
Superfly or MX Unleashed it was one of
them looking at pictures of
gameplay MX World Tour could have been
that MX rider was it just MX rider was
that the
original that looks familiar that cover
looks familiar that was good that was I
love that
game would use my PS5 plug uh sure too
powerful amp wise
yeah could be should be in let's load up
Discord and have a look at Jacob
Sunderland Evo team
I just haven't reached a new level
though HBY game you're just capping
you're just
capping
how's that Evo team coming
nice love
that we need a goalkeeper Evo so bad
it's so annoying that we probably won't
get
one I don't understand why they haven't
done goalkeeper evos like it's they're
not exactly difficult to
do it' just be like keep clean sheets or
something
five SP PS2 plugs
jeez uh if it doesn't then I'm guessing
the PS2 is broke hopefully it's
not
I'm sure like those things were made of
steel
ps2's they just kept
going PS2 was like I remember when I to
be fair when I when I changed from
PlayStation to Xbox the amount of
trouble that I had like with even the
Xbox 360 where you'd get that red ring
oh
criminal but I did I switched to Xbox
for a while it was seven years I think I
had my Xbox for
um XBox 360 then I yeah I think I had
my my Xbox one I started off streaming
as an Xbox streamer and
then I saw the light and I went back to
my PlayStation
routs and here I am now I don't regret
it
goed console yeah see I was I was very
young when I had a PS1 like I remember
it I think of what games I played on the
PS1 I might be getting Playstation One
mixed up with PlayStation 2 as
well but when I like I say I think
that's my happier
games I think PlayStation 2 happy like
happiest times as a
gamer PS2 is just my
childhood Tim your friendlies objectives
drive me nuts s uh friendlies just
aren't friendlies are they at
all Spyro yeah I played Spyro and
crash
um it was very
good both very good was a a ray Rayman
or something like that loved
that there so many
games see yeah I do you know what I
probably played more on Playstation One
than on PlayStation 2 cuz I had
a an uncle um my Uncle Paul used
to bring me just boxes and boxes of
games he was a massive
gamer like my dad liked gaming as
well I used to love watching my dad play
like Tomb Raider the old school Laura
Croft and then he played like James Bond
as well
still love watching my dad play them D
was like too young to be able to
complete a game like
that I think the first
game I ever properly like played through
and
completed was uh GTA 4 you
know it's the first game I ever played
start to finish and
completed and then cuz I was mature then
offline console 360 best online yeah I
feel that I feel
that I remember playing pro clubs once
and my headset had broken um to the
point I couldn't turn my microphone
off
and I think my nan was around and my nan
was just chat in Absolut like I love my
n Bits but she chats absolute [ __ ] like
my n will tell me about her AOS and
stuff you know like stuff that she's
ordered off AUST she'll tell me the item
number she'll tell me what page like
what page it's on she she's not like
that anymore but she she used to be just
addicted to Aros she loved it so my n
would be there in the background and I'm
trying to like you know I'm I'm in pro
clubs I'm like a a young very young
female gamer this point playing pro
clubs with a bunch of lads I've got my n
talking about [ __ ] Aros and I'm
trying to score outside the box you know
finesses like
bangers oh and I yeah and I couldn't
turn my microphone off and used to make
me dead
angry it's
funny I miss GTA 4 I've been thinking
about it a lot recently but you can't
play it on the PS5 can
you which is a shame cuz I would love to
I'd love to replay
that I'd love to replay GTA
4 I loved the story of the
game yeah I don't think you can get it
on PlayStation
5 sorry
that's poor for
me some tackle that is Cela mate let's
go [ __ ] off
great
goal they can get the 360 desk and put
it on Xbox one yeah cuz when I bought
the I bought like the trilogy um that
they they remastered didn't they they
remastered GTA 3 GTA
VI City and San
Andreas so I bought that and we will do
a playthrough of that at some point um
cozy game night tomorrow night by the
way do our next part of The Walking Dead
I'm thinking tomorrow break from
Ultimate Team in general it's been you
know we've we we've absolutely smashed
it Team of the Year wise
um only on this account the ritky to
Glory you know has been a bit me but
we've been all right we've done all
right
[Music]
um I think my plan is they should REM
Master GTA 4 yeah they
should better physics and five I felt
like there was more to do what I like
about GTA 4 is like this like if you're
just playing free
roam
um offline like free
roam you like you have to
you have to arrange to do any activities
whereas
like you just get random phone calls
brought GTA
4 like Roman wanting to go bowling or I
don't know like the others as well I
preferred that like I preferred that
side to GTA
4 I keep trying to replay red dead but
it's such a big game and it's one of
them that you don't want to rush either
so it's like I don't know if we'll have
time to ever read replay Red Dead if we
do we can it's something that we can
always go back to
but yeah I'm going to play uh finish the
Walking Deads and then we
will uh try to replay G the GTA's
again ready for GTA
6 I am excited for that I'm not going to
lie but yeah they should they should
make GTA 4 it's just one of them I've
not played it for so long I'd love to
play it again you might be able to get
it on PC actually I could I could always
look into that maybe replay it on
PC I'll have to get a USB controller but
I think you can get a I'm sure I've got
a wired Xbox controller lurking around
somewhere I don't think I could play
keyboard and
mouse
welcome in TT uh G hope you're doing
good GTA 4 is still online but uh
Playstation uh one thing I don't get
Xbox game pass they had Resident Evil 2
but not the rest start not the rest of
the game that's weird isn't it
yeah that is weird
everyone's favorite game
series I would be a fraud if I didn't
say GTA like I I love
GTA um sort of like less well-known
games I love the life of strange uh game
series if you've not checked that out
and you like those sort of games where
your decision impacts you know the path
of the game and the ending
Etc um it's one of them it's a bit Indie
as
well uh but yeah it's a very good game
uh our beloved
Bells uh is also doing a project around
that as well which is very exciting and
I think that's all I'm allowed to say so
I will shut my mouth right there sorry
BS if I've just got you into any trouble
but yeah it's a I really love that
series really
good I also enjoyed Telltale Games The
Walking Dead as well
um what else did I
like I'd like to say red dead but I've
truthfully only played the uh the latest
Red Dead I never played the first one I
never played red the original Red
Dead but I I loved Red Dead Redemption
too and I think I think overall I
preferred that to GTA
5 which sounds mad
but it was just so
good so so good sorry for the
coughing come on oh hit it straight at
the
keeper yeah I know yours is Final
Fantasy
absolutely did anybody play tacken back
in the day as well I loved
tacken absolutely love tacken so
good oh [ __ ] have you guys um those of
you who played the OG uh Tomb Raider the
one I can't think of which Tomb Raider
it was they're remaking it in fact I'll
be able to tell you the name of it in a
minute the one way you can lock the
butler in the
freezer um they're remaking
it Smith is just her isn't she she just
is her right let's whack some subs on
let's try and tip this game over the wi
now uh we will
bring odard on I think we'll go for
odard we'll go for them belly he helped
us out last
time we'll keep that as it is I
think could go for voler little bit of
pace about him let's go for it
Pokémon as well of course of course
Pokémon set up my old Xbox 360 and play
some of that yeah
definitely I like the what I really
liked the original Watch Dogs yeah watch
dogs one was fantastic really good story
[Music]
um really good really good
game
I think Watch Dogs one was my favorite
out of the all the Watch Dogs
games I do quite like Assassin's Creed
as well to be fair I'm not like a
massive fan of it but like
I all right tickle coming on I like it
um I need grab a
drink oh she's Put It Wide no
way
oh I needed that
drink yeah I
uh I really
liked really liked Watch Dogs um the
first
one I do that's the demell I
know 50 yeah I feel that I fill that
with Assassin's Creed the last one I
played was the egyp
one you got your camel in the desert was
all
right a I think I was really poly when I
played
that surprise surprise I know right
makes a change doesn't it yeah I was I
was really ill I've not played The Sims
for a while actually I've been thinking
about it especially with being ill and
then to be honest with you I said to mat
earlier I've not sat at my desk since
Thursday today's been the the first day
since the first day since then that I've
actually sat at my
computer um I did some editing
earlier and then I've been in and out of
bed really and we are one and two in
qualifiers at the minute unlucky game
though wasn't the end of the world
Resident Evil they ruined uh the
Resident Evil Village I'm too much of a
[ __ ] to play Resident Evil I'm not
going to
lie I watched I watched Charlie play
them
um I think I watched him play The
Village one the one with the giant dead
tall freaky woman that
one
Origins spalla and odyssey are on game I
think it was it Odyssey that I played I
think I want to say it was that
one but yeah you know what I'd give them
a go like I want to I say like once a
week I want to make sure we play a story
type
game what the
[ __ ] what the fu what is this
excuse
me fair enough mate someone's been doing
the icon SBC is bloody
L bloody
L righty righty O then okay that's that
then [ __ ] it all thank you
Trent ion FC in it
jeez what icon

team I get another I back back to
back yes
Kane
yes come
on go on me though yes
Beth get that in the middle
oh straight at the keeper Smith no way
yeah um each week probably if if I'm off
on a Sunday I think Sunday is always a
good day to do like a a nice story type
game how we
came you are a [ __ ] wizard
Harry thank
you
yeah I want to um grind objectives and
stuff on the ritky to Glory um I want to
get to that Thomas ritky
card um I'm not too fussed it sounds it
feels criminal to say I'm not too fussed
on this account about getting him or not
cuz he's not going to get into the team
um I would make space for him on the
bench purely purely because it's
Ritz but yeah
yeah it's a it's a tricky one it is a
tricky
one but I would like to uh get him on
the the ritky to Glory get that upgrade
on him pokon and stre in the future you
never know you never know power world
looks really good looks really
fun
but yeah
um Elliot and Seb have been a a massive
help to be
fair like I didn't even realize they'd
got I think it was Seb that's finished
it in the end I think he's he got the
celra SBC done for me and it's you know
it's just one last thing for me to have
to do
and like I say like it's meant that
tonight I could come on save the rest of
my packs because I'm not really asked
about this promo I can save my packs now
ready for future stars which might have
one or two cards that you know could
then push into the team with
um
depending I would like if I could pick
somebody to get into my team it's not a
future St
well I I don't know well well it's not
going to be a future stars card I would
like Viara I would like Patrick Viara
I'd put him in over bird camp and I'd
have a Midfield of granite Jacka and a
patri
via and Midfield two cuz that's you
wouldn't you don't really need anything
else I'm to do you
really
when does chump finish is it back to
Sunday well Monday now is
it cuz I know they extended it didn't
they
Ah that's silly as well cuz that could
have been 3 n in a rage
quit thank you for eight likes on the
stream I should really change the title
to foot champ should
know I I expected to come on and open my
packs and then I just thought like why
don't I just wait until there's a promo
out that I've got that that's actually
got cards that can get into the
team we've got a good mixture there of
32 packs at the minute Future Stars
dropping next
Friday but yeah I think if I could get
anybody for this team now I'd get a i'
got
via cuz then need'd be my main DM and
I'd have Granite as a box to
box and I say that cuz obviously I can't
get a team of the year now cuz they're
not in uh packs
anymore I wouldn't complain at a rodri
or a de
bruyne H
then yeah it's it's good because I can
either get another a good boxto boox
card and then and keep them playing you
know in that in the role that bear camps
in now or I could get a a better DM and
then shift you know move Granite to
higher up in the Midfield and have him
play the box to box cuz I'm happy for
granite to be that and have the other
one as as my main
DM
the cheapest Pokemon game I've seen is
just over1 pound
Jesus we'll say that
though any objectives
no
I think I'm working Monday and then off
on
Tuesday just thought another Future
Stars some man woman's goalkeeper Kira
keting cool would be
nice I've seen one leak and that was the
one one that Bells posted on Tik
Tok
have oh my [ __ ] it's not insane I've
made Veil Twitter very
depressed posted a run it back with our
Squad that won at Wembley and everyone's
just
depressed where's Kaye
at
I missed that Squad so much it's crazy
to think a squad that we had a couple
years ago is literally
like 10 times better than the squad that
we've got
now
why we let warl go and you guys you what
all know all about warl purely from how
much I used to praise
him and he's like doing decent at Barrow
now as
well got in it absolutely got
in tempted to do the Kim CH PC
yeah I don't mind bir camp for now um he
doesn't I don't think he's much
different to the odard at these he's
maybe a little bit more solid um than
what OD God
was
but I could do with somebody a bit
better Kim it should be good
but I just don't know I'd struggle to
get him
in the only Pro actually I would be able
to get him
in
because I've already got
granite and
Kane Kane gets cem because of the you
the other English players that we've got
um so I probably would be able to get
him
in what do you reckon chat shall we
complete
him it was what I was saying I was
crying out for really it is an area that
I I do need to to improve on let's take
that off of
in what do we
reckon yeah he gets
full he puts Granite on full as
well
and then I'd have kimich on stay
back and granite on
balanced should we do
it I might ask
Twitter
have you played a game
called CH I'm not even going to no I
haven't I have not I'm not even going to
attempt that one M what what is it what
is
it
[Music]
you
oh let me go on Tik Tock and follow um
baggy's
back
I think that's buggies dropped my follow
back
guess the location year and decade I
would be absolutely
hopeless
just accepted your request no worries
yeah I've just uh taking a little
breather which is ironic I'm struggling
to
breathe
got it spot on fair
enough feel free to follow the
socials
all right let's
go
oh his Defender was coming across and
definitely about to close me down
there
ah uh s HP and no one else knew what it
was now I wouldn't have a clue
either
great tackle thank you van
dijke that's why you the
goat some save that was Addison my
friend that was some
safe so I finished Team of the Year then
with two team of the years and three
Honorable Men

vouch I do get my theme Pursuits done do
you know what we have had our absolute
ass handed to us there so what GG's to
that guy you win some you lose
some yeah I will be getting it done
because I've got evos to finish and what
I do is I do my evos with theme Pursuit
so I put him into a squad uh Around
theme Pursuit and just got it all done
all together basically tends to be
usually what I go for what I try to do
Edson Bernard uh pop and check
nice fair play right I'm going to go I'm
going to take a little break for a
minute I need to brush my hair through
as well I I don't have greasy hair but
way it was just wet I had a shower
before a stream tonight cuz I thought it
had help me feel a bit better to be fair
I mean it did
work I feel like I needed a really hot
shower just to try and loosen up some of
that you can you can have like hair
brushing as ASMR right
now um yeah I'm going to go grab a drink
and stretch for extra a
minute give my eyes a a break from the
screen go and chat that my mom's all
right and the dogs that ah just have a
little a little Wonder for a minute or
two that's
trying don't use any of them apart from
Edison yeah I mean that's
fair that is fair I only called you
Bells then M for some reason bells on
the
brain I have is because he sent me
AAA
um so two people have said yes to
completing
kimage at the
moment so we'll
see I think we I think we've like more
or less got enough fod to get Kim done
uh send you my yeah feel free to do so
like I say just cuz I don't do team
review anymore doesn't mean that I won't
still look at your teams you can still
St send me your teams but I'm not going
to show them on stream anymore or like
take time
to look at everybody's team all at once
like how we used
to yeah I need to go stretch my legs
right I'd advise you not do the same as
well as you get old you realize
like as a kid you can just sit and game
like all day like when you get older
have to keep moving around otherwise
you I don't know your body it just get
away oh I'm in my pajama buttom do you
know what I've told you all now
so never
mind
cold in my room I'm never happy am I
literally never happy I'm either
roasting or
freezing never in between
I put my hoodie behind me so I was going
to put it on if I got cold but I just
put my radiator on for a bit
instead think guess the heating in our
house like permanently stays on
anyway don't ask me
how uh sent
you either
team for either a right wing or left
wing for hemple CI
um they're just too good yeah
right let's have a
look uh yeah because you've got e and
her do you know what
htic like I don't know like as a player
I'm not a bit like what it sounds really
harsh saying that but I'm not she's not
one of my favorites you know what I mean
like I know she's she's a gunner but
she's not one of my
favorites but do you know what her card
is actually really good like she scores
loads of headers as well I don't know
about for you lot but I've used it when
I've been doing objectives and stuff and
I did I did do an EVO with her cuz I
don't think it fit anybody else I think
it I think it's the same one that you
might have done M cuz it took her from
an 85 or an 84 or an 8 was it an 85 I
think up to an 88 so I was like yeah
we'll do it for the like for the sake of
it but yeah she's um she's really really
good in game she's a good card really
good card I do like
it yeah I do like
her the team looks good looks fairly
solid
this is a bad one
sorry
oh I know it's going to be a bad one
when my chest rattles horrible school's
more Outside the Box shots for me yeah
she is really good like I say she's
somebody who I look at and on the
surface I'm like but when you actually
use her in game and admittedly I mostly
used her in Squad battles to be fair um
but I think I used her for a bit on the
Ritz to glory and I used her in Rivals
and she was so good such a the good
thing about a card is she's one of them
that's she's very consistent as well I
find she's always like always
good
um right if it's
clear that we should do bird
Camp
um B do B Camp I meant I meant Kim sorry
my brain at a
moment let's have a look if on the the
surface we can get kimage done
right so kimage is four squads 88 86 85
and
84 if we could do this 88 rated Squad
should we should we just get him done
should we just go for
it oh we might
struggle we're not going to be able to
get him done straight away
need a couple more
walkouts what should we do should we
open some
packs try and get try and get him
done or do we hold
off wait for future stars and see what
could possibly be coming out then let me
have a look to see what Sheriff's
put Sheriff posted
any
r
b
Gandy
Cru I don't know hold off for now shall
we he's got 10 days left on him which
will take us up until the new promo
anyway won't we the next
promo cuz I think Future Stars drops
next
week next
Friday be's got 10 days left on him
that'll be 7 8 9 10 so that'll be
Tuesday the 13th I think you'll
go
so yeah we'll hold off for
now how many wins am I am I three and
three yeah and we just need one more win
don't me to
qualify thank you for nine likes on the
stream what's good is like I think there
was O see he's got chem
done right back to
focus if I do lose this one I'll take a
a quick break and we could we could do
something in pursuit of Sumit oh it's a
bad start I didn't have a good
feeling we'll keep chipping away we were
flying at one point and we've just kind
of falling off a little bit but I'm sure
we'll get back to cruising again at some
point
nearly deflected enough and out then
that yeah thank you for [ __ ] off thank
you for [ __ ] off thank you for nine
likes on the stream I do appreciate it
if they go 3-0 up we will just quit I
think we've hit a bit of a a brick wall
and we probably need just a bit of a
break from online game playay for a
little
bit try my look again tomorrow possibly
we will actually I was going to have the
day off of Ultimate Team tomorrow but
we'll see I am supposed to be going out
with Becky uh and Ben tomorrow yeah 3 n
we'll call it there we'll call it there
for Champs we're now three and four I
think we'll get qualified we've only got
one more win to go with how we played
earlier it's there and I think we'll be
all right
I think we've just hit a little bit of a
wall but um I would like to make some
progress with the Heros because I've got
a lot to
do in terms of evos when you look at it
I've got
the prospect I could get these ready to
be fair so we've got the team of the
Year Prospect we've also got
the right what is it called right side
Star team of the a striker
Prospect
um I mean we could get have HS up to an
88 we've already got him at left back
though so I'd probably take Russo get
her up to an
87 could be somewhat decent do love do
love Lessie
Russo um so yeah that could that could
work I've been wanting to do some with
Russo for a bit as well so we've got her
to do for that and then right sided I I
think this is where we struggled wasn't
it I don't I don't think I saw anybody
to do for this now I will have a look if
there's any Veil players for that other
one as
well um a Lis say we could do
maybe but this is just to get a blue a
blue
card
[Music]
um I think chislet qualifies for
this
yeah it does but it only gets him to a a
67 it's a bit of an L really isn't
it I've got nobody to do the super
powers thing on
double plus
Pursuit what the [ __ ] is that that is
insane can I do a veil player on this
cuz
that a 74 up to an
88
class so Veil
wise what we talking what we're looking
at there Veil
wise probably nothing
insane cheers
again so that would be better than
getting chers blue would be to get a 78
rated
ches probably more more worth it isn't
it but we're like we're only on 51k so
we'll have to pull a finger out and get
cracking um
yeah I think we'll go for that so I
think for this one we just do
Russo
um unless it'll let me boost
Wilson
I thought Wilson would qualify for this
so it take Wilson up to a 68 maybe it's
a little bit of a Plus on him the only
negative is he do have to play
Rivals I'd have to play Rivals with
Wilson
yikes but I do it though just to give
Wilson a
boost cuz getting the freebies done on
him he might be able to qualify for one
of the bigger ones sign and give him
that big
jump that would be nice was giving him
that little bit of a
boost do we do Wilson or Russo I
probably thing is like Russo I could do
on the Ritz to Glory so I'll have the
opportunities on like them accounts to
do so I better put my glasses back on
protect my eyes and all
that yeah we could
do um welcome back baggies how's it
going
yeah probably will I mean we've got to
finish this one yet anyway get Kofi up
to an
84
um which is pretty sick to be
fair so I guess we'll crack on with that
for now
then get that theme Pursuit
done any other objectives we could do as
well there was this one as well French
wall
so concede one or L uh with having six
French players in your squad let's get
this team rocking and
rolling and let's go it's been fun using
the main team it's been good it's been
nice but I think cuz we fit a bit bit of
a wall with Champs qualies now three and
four we should get qualified like I say
I'm not worried about about getting
qualified I think we'll be absolutely
fine
but we'll just
um make sure we see it
through I wonder if kona's gone up in
price cuz I'm tempted to sell I'm not
going to lie we've got a tradeable so
I'm very tempted to sell it and I just
think with them going out with
packs I do wonder if she's got I think
she was like 50k before
55k she's gone up to 61 so she has gone
up a bit not drastically probably could
have left Shu in there but I think if we
go mainly for a backline of French
players that's one
two three of
course uh
four
[Music]
five six that I'll do that's our six
French then we've got room for four and
I think it was four Italian league
wasn't it they were the
first first four we could go for JW
which actually means we could take a
French player no we'll leave him in
we'll leave him
in I I say we could take a French player
out if we wanted to the time inju but
we'll leave him in we'll go for Lis
Alberto and lofter cheek as well
cracking let me see if my boys are in
the game yet does anyone know when their
transfers will um be an ultimate team if
you get me the new transfer
cards I've gone the wrong way there I
just search for
just black pool for now isn't
it oh is Veil cards there are you not
going to let me buy these again can I
buy my veil players again chat are we
condoning it are we condoning it is it
okay is it
okay am I
allowed uh I'm going to do some Squad
battles now baggies I've just gone three
and four in qualifiers for Champs so
I've still got three games left to
qualify only need one win um so should
should qualify but I'm just taking a
break now from from
qualifiers thank you
Matt Matt's Ru guys no shouting at me
Matt said it's
okay it's all on you Mt yes
Jensen want to make sure we get his
portel card though cuz if I accidentally
buy his Blackpool card I will
cry that's support B one as well
and I was panicking then thinking I
wouldn't be able to buy it and I thought
I'm gone no one else is going to be
trying to get a gensen we it's you know
the chances are very slim uh who else
was going to be in the game so ooch
II that's the one so he's not is he just
not in the game
yet they haven't done Uchi uh what about
Gore Daniel
Gore
wait they haven't got a portel card for
him yet
either Jensen was one of the first
ones
um let me concept
it and if you keep the M okay B
deal let's concept
it so we've got the
yeah there's
Jensen then we've already
got uh already got
them so it is just jents and Weir at the
minute then which is sound that's okay
we can live with that can't
we what rating was jent it was a silver
was he what was he
60
s rated was he
66 we could we could maybe get a nice
little Evo on Jensen to be fair sorry
just for messing about out here I just
just want to see if he qualifies for any
out that are out at the
minute with him being a 60
66 take doesn't qualify for that
one pretty good player to be fair I
don't know what he's doing at
Vil respect it like
but well his dad was uh well his David
we those of you who remember
him few of you might do I bet I wonder
if he could we could get him in on this
this would be sick a prop a nice little
push for
him yeah he
does oh look at that
beautiful a thing of beauty
that that is a thing of
beauty I'm surprised gar isn't legible
for that
as much as I like
Jensen and I hope he does well for
us I do love Ben Garett is my favorite
Veil
player used to be Dave warl followed by
gy
but we decided to sell warl cuz we are
absolute
mugs exactly but I don't think we even
sold him I don't think we actually got a
FIFA World he just left we just didn't
renew his deal or whatever just
[ __ ] anyway let's
go H imagine we drop a chance for that
team tortured absolutely
tortured team of the week we'll go for
it yes yes I know you can't install the
update it's
fine yeah we could do that 100K Evo on
jent
somewhere you be
interesting I forgot what I actually
need to do with bber I think clean
sheets was in there so but I might have
made that
up might well have made that up you know
we'll
see
oh come
on
oh thought hour was
in save
that fair
play shame that carer hasn't got up in
price I wonder if she'll go up anymore
if she'll just say it stay at 60
okay
um
I don't remember the name of it Matt
don't
worry it'll just be something I know
that I haven't got to play Rivals with
it it'll just I know it won't be score
goals either cuz he's a center back I
think it's literally just play games
think it's like play so many win so many
two clean sheets think I played two I
need to H yeah I think I needed to win
two play four and then two clean sheets
as well
so what we'll do is we'll just try and
go five up if we
can we need to try not to concede for uh
the objective anyway for the French part
that we're doing for that is it for
basari I think the French
bit
[Music]
true yeah it was I think it was
something roughly like
that
I just know I've got quite a bit to do
with it so but we've got theme pursuit
to do we've got that other objective to
do as well so we can mix it all together
can't
we as we always do always doing the
most just getting like the most done per
game as we possibly
can
yeah we'll see if we can um we'll see
what comes out for future stars the
might be some good sbcs at future stars
as well this road to the final stuff
it's okay and it's good in the sense of
obviously you can get like upgrades um I
think aren you
so there is that if we get one you know
I'm not going to complain about getting
one but I'm also not going to stress
about trying to pack one
either um
braz no and I've just remembered there
was a Brazilian bit wasn't there you
have to score one ever I got one on the
bench by
chance no don't think any of them boys
are Brazilian
yeah I will get that done you just need
to score one game it score one goal in
three games I think it is isn't it with
the Brazilians I do
remember my bad but no we'll we'll get
it done be absolutely
fine
thank you for still being here
Oscar three goals for the good no it's
all good I'll
uh to be fair I
probably oh no I wouldn't have struggled
cuz or would
I no I probably would have found a way
around it because I've got giru that
counts for Italian league and the French
as
well one goal and seven matches it's
seven o
Christ that is a
lot that's a lot of
games do as best as we can
though we'll get through it as best we
can
bet some of the leagues that we do will
have Brazilian players so we'll just
whack whatever Brazilian player we've
got from each
league for the themed
Pursuit I'm sure the I'm sure the liga's
got a couple of good Brazilian
attackers
is it any Brazilian player or is it one
of them where it's like Brazilian
attackers unlucky
demell siio is so good nice
yeah I'm not too
sure have a look at where we're at in a
minute any Brazilian player that's okay
I know I've got some Brazilian
midfielders
Portuguese league as well they've got
good good handful of Brazilian players
as
well yeah we we'll get it
though
G Can't Believe G doesn't qualify for
many evos it's very
depressing
[Music]
I said we'd stop at 5 nil but because
I'll end up just switching off I'd
rather just keep trying and get the
goals and I need get cuz I need keep
clean
sheets and I need to keep the go I just
need to keep the goals that we can see
to a
minimum
manag to mute in time
then
tackle yeah thank you for the new subs
tonight we are just four subscribers
away from uh
4,180
180 20 then well 24 technically all
together away from uh
4.2k which be great to hit to be fair
getting our you know next 100 Into
5K
oh yeah really pushing on
uh I'm just I need to have a good think
about what kind of content uh you know
like live content I want to do on Tik
Tok
um just sort have a good sit and think
about it and decide if that if I'm going
to bring uh multi streaming back as well
cuz it's just one of them things it's
like it's great to be on other platforms
but you know YouTube's the main and
YouTube's the one that I I
primarily want to prioritize and grow
welcome in uh GT4 hope you're doing good
no problem for The Raid by the way hope
your stream went well I'm sorry that I
don't always get to jump in I will say a
lot of the
time a lot of the time as I'm raiding
out um all Pokemon pack opening let's do
it let's go for it see I'd thought about
getting into Collectibles let me right
let me not go off on a tangent um no
when I more often than not if I'm
raiding out if I don't come in for long
don't be offended it's usually cuz I'm
like heading to work uh which I'm pretty
sure was the the case I've accidentally
done the uh another theme Pursuit there
without even checking which is
brilliant but yeah I've been thinking
about getting into Collectibles Mt like
opening
um not match attacks but there's other
there's another one where you get like
signed cards as well I might get back
into that cost me a bloody arm and a leg
but I used to love like collecting cards
as a
kid went over 12 that was 2,000 packs
opened and you got Team of the Year
APS that is an absolute Bruiser that
that is an absolute
Bruiser
damn wow fair play for the grind though
got to respect that grind to be fair
absolutely but yeah I'm sorry that it
was it was justs hot in the end
criminal absolutely criminal what are
your thoughts on um road to the finals
are you have you got any packs left over
or did you absolutely just Splurge out
into that's a awful statement
sorry you know what I mean though did
you just open everything for uh Team of
the
Year as you could tell I got ill towards
the end of team of the year so I had
like I think I had
like 100 200 packs left at one point
messaged a couple of streamers I was
like listen I've got content if you want
it um Elliot opened a bunch for us and
Seb did as well and they they just like
recycled stuff for us as well which is
great they managed to get CA done s i
was yeah
yeah yeah I'm thinking of getting back
into that M and like I say that could be
something that we do on uh on Tik Tok I
need to have a good think it's something
that I need to have a good sit and think
about
um got 250 packs left right now but got
nowhere to put the C I know that's the
thing isn't it we should get repeatables
back on Monday I presume fingers crossed
even if it's just player picks of some
sort um but what are your thoughts of
road to the final cuz I've I've got
33 packs there we've got a proper like
mixture but I've said tonight I think
I'm going to I see I titled the stream
opening the left of our pack the what's
left of our
packs but I've actually we got a couple
of Mega packs in there as well nice I've
actually since then decided to just hold
off until Future Stars cuz there's
nothing really that excites me about
road to the final like there's some
decent stuff and if I pack it like
elsewhere then fine like fair enough but
at the same time
um what I might do but well what I'm
thinking is there might be stuff that I
think there's more chance of stuff being
out um oh you're doing kemit are you
okay okay I
might wait for uh future stars to open
my packs I
reckon do you reckon I should do kimage
I'll show you the team I put it out on
Twitter
earlier we did just pack an 87 as well
didn't we from well we got one from a
pick so and to the finals you have to
wait uh till May for the upgrad yeah
that's the
thing you probably forget about the
cards that you've got until they get the
like until you get the
upgrades but
sorry for the coughing I was thinking
about getting
um getting kit
done and popping him in over bird
Camp cuz I play with at the minute
Granite is like a DM so I have him on
stay back and I have Dennis just on like
free roam which works hard okay bird
Camp isn't
terrible benchin 91 k for the Kim do you
know I I might let you do kimage and
then I'll hop in once you've got
him and I'll be like how you getting on
with gimit is he worth doing cuz he's
got like 10 days left on him hasn't he
so I can't quite do the uh 88 yet but
I'm not a million miles away I don't
think especially we're just packing an
87 then what scad are we on now we're on
an 86 now so
popping 87 into that
um takes is up 2 and 87 so like one
rating off which isn't too
bad yeah we'll see I'll favorite
him yeah just W 88 Squad off him
nice
yeah so I'm it is something I'm thinking
about as well considering cuz what I'll
do is I'll put him in over um bird camp
and
play for Bundesliga right
okay I know Matt this is the thing as
well isn't it Kim kimich this is the
thing I probably should I was I I was
editing my Clips back today remember
when I got a team of the year I got
honorable I got my first honorable
mentions it was Trent actually so I'd
got I'd got van djk at this point um and
it was like blue I knew it was going to
be honorable mentions and I was like I
was just gassed to see Kim little in
there as well just just gold rare him
little purely for the name concept but
yeah I am consider yeah I think I I
think Matt I think I will get him
done right we could take out the four
Italian league get four Bundesliga in
instead uh if there's any Bundesliga
players that I've
got that are this is Handy by the way
hav't it it's just
that sorry there any Bundesliga players
I've got that happen to
be uh
Brazilian that would also be a big
help no Brazilians
there we have for granite and andrich
teammates
actually yeah no Strikers either boo
right we'll go for Kane and vaa what a
combo for bloody Squad
battles
crazy but yeah no worries on the raid
like hopefully I I get to raid uh raid
you more often as
well it's nice to like raid different
people as well from time to time um
hopefully I just get some more time to
spend another yeah we were right M it
was play for win to two clean
sheets next part we have got to play
Rivals that's going to be fun isn't it
Rivals with an 81 rated Kofi
bber oh I love evos I
do right let's go have I got too many
French players in here do
I one two two three four five six no
I've got Bob on
six one two three
four five six four Bundesliga I wonder
if do you Reon it will work if I sub the
Brazilians on M do reckon that would
work
we could give it a
go sent the PlayStation pick on my team
no worries I'll check it in a
moment it should do thank
you doesn't say they have to start does
it doesn't mention them starting
honestly take casemiro out and
just uh no we'll keep him on actually
we'll keep him on I was going to say
just W them to up
top would be laughing Vin and
Nelly yeah we'll go for
that I'll check your team as well while
the game's loading
up
sorry that we're just doing Squad
battles for the time
being so what's your team saying so hers
was no use to you whatsoever then vas
saw
cfu that's that's fair GG's on getting
sour done by the Way Insane that looks a
good
team good
team yeah Kim kimch in that Midfield
build will be wonders for
you did you say you got kante there at
the
minute Granite Jacker and he's
missed right let's WP these Brazilian
boys on see if it
works it either will or it won't simple
as go battles help to X yeah it's just
convenient to get stuff done Squad
battles there we go there we go on a
platter for Martin Ali
that easiest header real ever
score kante uh 2 cam Kim kimage gets
full yeah see I managed to get my it if
I get kimage done I'll manage to get him
on full cuz I've got granite and Kane in
the squad so they help him I've also got
a Bundesliga manager as
well
um so yeah
it's it's no issue
really now we don't need clean sheets
anymore for the bber uh Evo
but for this French thing the six French
players we do need to try and concede
less than one I think it said so we can
concede one but that's it no no more
than
one
I've got a feeling it's only three games
for
that joing team of the year I was
spamming the team of the week picks uh I
got 102 team of the weeks
wow that is not
that that's
not
yeah I actually had to I'm not even
going to lie chat I had to edit the clip
where I Pat Trent because I was so like
I was like oh Kim little like I I
honestly didn't care for Trent I I did
obviously but in the clip it just seemed
like I was like oh I love Kim little I
love I wanted her was it a thunder
struck card or something like that I was
like yeah I really wanted that card blah
blah blah I was just waffling about Kim
little like I hadn't just packed my
first honorable mentions and the the the
only other blue that I'd packed at that
point after obviously getting Van
Dyke
got to my all and quickly uh quickly and
do the Tim the air crafting P nice
yeah Ah that's poor
I thought I thought i' B that tried
dribble it in the
net
for
but my and I have two founder upgrades
let's
go
I
got a
feeling I think I'm in work at 2: on
Monday I'm going to go to the
doctor's um I've got a feeling I might
need some antibiotics
cuz my chest was so bad
earlier like I got a chest infection to
be fair apparently I think it was
from earlier this week I think it was
like Wednesday or something this yeah
was Wednesday this week um you can now
get prescribed antibiotics by a
pharmacist they can actually prescribe
you with antibiotics so I might actually
just go into a
pharmacy um rather than going down the
doctor's route cuz they're trying to
lessen GP appointments aren't they like
GPS can't cope or
something so I might go down that route
instead actually and get a
um see if I can get some antibiotics
just my chest is that bad it's so
tight I think I was worst the worst I
was was definitely Thursday you lot saw
when I was when I went live like I was
so
poorly so
poorly we're get in
there it's just rough
like I missed the football as well I
miss going to
games even though Veil got a dick today
it would have been nice to have gone we
filled out the away end at
Fleetwood took 1100 think it was was a
sellout fair
play but yeah I'll be back there
soon it's not even that I'm not getting
the time off work I'm getting the time
off work so I'm poorly at the minute
anyway so it's
like we'll be there soon doing my little
Match Day Vlogs
again
cute it's so difficult to do you know
full like credit to people who go and do
like a
proper proper match I could never do a
proper Match Day Vlog see like when I
Vlog in general I just record what's
going on I don't really speak you know
just put some nice music over it and
then I I do like bits where I'll sit and
talk after it's a bit of I like to split
it up with a vlog but you get people who
like actually go around and they're like
talking to the I couldn't do that and
people do it people who do like proper
match day vogs they do it at the
football as well there
certain two young Lads um that set a
channel up and they've done really well
to be
fair um and I I watched one of there CU
they went to Wembley funnily enough when
veale went to Wembley um and played
against
Mansfield for uh
promotion and they went to the game and
that's why I watched it cuz I was like
oh I wonder if I'll see yeah it's one of
them or I wonder if I'll see myself on
there so I I clicked on um and yeah that
I dropped him I can't remember what
they're called I am I'm still subscribed
to them now it's just I very very rarely
get chance to actually sit and watch
YouTube these days
it's I'm either streaming or editing
um and in my own time I watch like
Netflix and
stuff I feel like there's just not
enough
like not enough hours and a day
to
um get everything done hit the
minute Ultimate Team takes up so much of
your time as well genuinely

stream um I would play I would be
playing more career mode than than

thought is at so stick stick with that

head what you're thinking

you've got to get sour in there prong
Fighters that's good that's a good
one sent you them on Twitter DM
literally to to you that sounds
good I will have a
look in a minute daily no
no having to like stop play to mute the
mic and cough is not the one thank you
CA come
on
if I had the time I would definitely run
a third account of just an allw women's
team yeah I was looking in Alia's
stream and uh somebody somebody was like
oh it's sexist that you're doing that I
was like
mate like in no way was it anything
against like there was no thing against
any man or anything but yeah apparently
the idea of having an all women's team
was
sexist sorry to get excited like the
first year that women are in the game an
ultimate team that
is but I might run something like that
in uh FC 25
maybe if we get to go fulltime I promise
I will
run and all women's I'll run a third
account but I don't think we'll go
fulltime in
fc24 fc25 is a push but we've just got
to keep going and keep grinding bright I
want to see these
fries oh my god wow
they look so
good they actually look so
good Korean barbecue chicken with fries
o that looks
good
oh even
Steven But Here Comes Kelly
Smith oh my God yes rebound goal we'll
take it rong's fantasy I like
that no worries
colum oh yeah it's your birthday soon
isn't
it me
Meo go on Beth have to go now uh bed 12
days for my birthday be 18 probably uh
get best done then yeah no
problem remembered you're saying that
you're the big 18
soon I'm sure we'll see you before then
but if we don't do have a happy birthday
but I yeah pretty hopeful we'll speak to
you before then
anyway
if I could get an EVO on Viv mear by the
way she's 100% getting into the into the
team that's a great
goal that is some
finish what is my Van Dyke
doing how we go here we go here we
go
oh my
God thank you for 11 likes on the stream
by the way I do really appreciate
it
ca
I'm not sure what to run in
fc25 I am liking the idea of having like
an all women's
team um on one
account
that was
the missed that chance and was like yeah
no it's
done
fair but you have every they had every
single reason like every single chance
to come back into that game every single
chance to come back into that game it
was only
5'4 it was only
5'4 and like they finished their chances
really well as
well but I'm not
complaining yeah I'm thinking in FC 25
uh because in this one I've done so much
with evos and stuff I'm thinking of
running something that's Evo related and
something that is
[Music]
um
kind of relates around the women side to
the game as well like the
WSL apparently no SOS for Liverpool
tomorrow interesting one
Oscar interesting
one I'm not optimistic like I I like to
be positive I'll always backers but I
I'm not expecting anything tomorrow I
think Liverpool have just got such a big
point to prove
um you know they're trying to trying to
do it for Klo there's there's a lot for
you know riding on on Liverpool and that
Liverpool side this season I think the
Vibes are like pretty deep and it's I
I'm just not optimistic I would love to
be I would love to be I think in the
games where we've played Liverpool this
season we' played really well um please
rage quit that will count for oh yes a
clean sheet as well and we get a good
outg parade hey welcome in we got young
B we've got Pavel as well welcome in
guys how is it going thank you so much
for the raid thank you for grabbing that
link for me Matt as well uh anyone who

ill at the minute um yeah I am coughing
a lot so trying not to do so on
stream I keep trying to mute my mic

yeah I'm uh other than that I'm pretty
good other other than being really ill
I'm I'm pretty good I hope you're doing
good as well it was an Among Us stream
haven't done these in a long time oh
sounds good isn't it so refreshing to
like switch up from FIFA well FIFA fepsy
from time to time as well Kim did you
see what I said about if you do a sack's
glory you could name it Saucy sack yeah
I could do I could
do be a pretty good
one it's just like is frustrating
because and you know other creators I
mean Oak
probably as well is like when you have
so many ideas of things you want to do
sort of content Wise It's so difficult
when you've got all of these ideas and
just not physically enough time to put
all of that together it's like it's it's
so frustrating cuz you're like there's
just so many ideas that you've got and
you can't physically Al do them all
because there's just not enough time you
know you got all the commitments like
work and stuff and that's the upper hand
of of going fulltime with with streaming
and content creation as well it's
yeah depends what you change to I get
that though Among Us is great but it can
get real toxic can't it I know when
we've done Among Us in the past it gets
real toxic thank you for the the get
well messages I'm okay it's just a like
a really bad cold virus what's the team
looking like not that that is the
objective team
um I do have team of the air vbd he is
first owned we are a first owned
RTG um I do apologize if that pisses you
off bber obviously isn't usually in
there either we do have celba at the
back uh with him I'm just doing an EVO
on bber so I'm a I'm an Arsenal fan and
my local team is Port Vale as well so I
do follow them um yeah I know it's it's
double the pain double the depression
pretty much um but no joking decid it's
uh the team's coming along nicely I'm
thinking of getting kimch done uh only
11 games mate that's how ill I've been
literally that's how ill I've been I've
not played that's that's all I've played
since
uh that's all I've played
since in fact I didn't play any games
while I was opening pack so that's since
I packed van djk which
was we packed vanik on like the Sunday
so like nearly a week I played 11 games
in a week
literally that's how it goes that's how
it's been yeah Smith is very good really
like Smith uh har dropping vola because
I really like him too but obviously Kane
Kane is Kane Kane's really good as well
uh we are doing some uh Evo though and
themed Pursuit as well cuz
I'm I've got some packs left over from
Team of the Year um and I'm just not
really too fussed about the current
promo there's not really anything in
there that
I really want to really want to use
so what I am going to do uh oh we put
extra French players in there
so I'm going to
start one of the Brazilians I think
I do get my loans used up in Squad
battles by the way I refuse to go into
an online game game mode with loans and
I hate having loans sitting in the club
so I'm not using r charison at
all uh as you remembered me about that
time problem uh we shus have I will have
to go now yes no worries thank you so
much for the raid I do appreciate it I
appreciate you lot coming in as well and
chilling it's always nice to see but
yeah have a have a great rest of your
night and I'll be fine I'll be well
enough soon yeah we've got more than six
French in here aren't we 1 two three
four five six seven we've got seven
eight actually
sound we'll crack back on with some more
stuff then I am sorry that it Squad
battles guys I do apologize but it helps
us get evos done um and yeah as I was
saying the RO the final stuff it's not
bad I'm not knocking it but it's on the
contrary there's not a lot that's great
for me or benefits my team uh which
might make me a bit of a snob POS
possibly my team's just in a good
position and there's not really any need
for for me to Splash my packs out on it
at the
minute
[Music]
um or let's
go so it's uh it's my first time using
orber as well crazy
crazy but yeah I'm going to wait till
Future Stars I think for the most part
I'm going to save some of my better
packs anyway for future
stars do you know once you get into that
habit of saving packs as well it's dead
easy to just carry on saving it really
is when we were opening up cuz I'd saved
about I'd saved between 300 4 I can't
remember the exact number number that I
saved up it's about 300 or
400 but like I was obviously I did no
man left behind so any duplicates went
into more sbcs for more packs and stuff
as well Team of the Year check but it's
really good to me oh yeah yeah check's
really good check's really good I think
one of our mods Bells uh said that he
got
check and he uh he uploaded some
gameplay the other night that I was
watching and he he yeah he said that he
really liked chck he used him a couple
of times now so Future Stars Holland I
think uh Mayu will get one is it Mayu or
Mayo I think someone needs to tell me
how to pronounce that name I think he'll
get one um I think Palmer is basically
confirmed Cole Palmer I think Oscar Bob
from
City uh Connor Bradley from Liverpool I
reckon I think those guys will get one
yeah he he will definitely get
one drink some sour soup sour soup okay
now I'm intrigued what is sour
soup ginger tea as well healthy as ever
in no time I've thought about get J I'm
going to get myself like just some
different flavored teas I've really
thought about that like green teas as
well chai
tea that sounds like a plan I might have
a look on it Amazon now vitamin C as
well yeah of course vitamin C is great
for colds isn't
it I do drink a lot of smoothies to be
fair with
the high vitamins but I I think it's
good to just directly
take Vitamin C as
well oh butrick is a is a special one he
um he's quite
um he's quite random with his
levels
it's like the same way that streamlabs
works basically with like top hours and
stuff sour is the only taste that you
can actually taste that's why I said
sour fair enough fair
enough I always crave chicken soup or
like chicken noodle soup when I'm Ill
like this add lemons and stuff
okay somebody said something
like
so I could tell the cough medicine that
I had at like six is starting to wear
off cuz I'm coughing more now going to
have some more in a minute but
um somebody said have something called a
hot toy which is is quite
oldfashioned
um
which I think they said it's like lemon
lemon juice use hot water and like
whiskey or something like that which I
mean to be
fair I can see it I can I can imagine
that would do wonders but
yeah do you have a headache no I started
off a bit
headachy I felt you know what I felt a
little bit under the weather since
Becky's birthday which was the 19th of
of JN and then it it was very on and off
I kept getting these headaches and
they'd go
and then I think it was Wednesday I just
got really like really ill Wednesday it
hit me Wednesday night I was dead dizzy
at
work um but I got sent home from work
Thursday and Friday I should have been
and work
today and they were like yeah well I
just said like there's no point me
coming in there's no point me coming in
today because um I said this when they
sent me home home yesterday I was like
you might as well just get my Saturday
shift covered cuz I work in a
pub and I'm like yesterday I was trying
to serve
customers and people were being really
awkward yesterday like they they were
ordering meals and they wanted
everything modifying so like they'd
order a burger that's it's called the
clicking hot stack right they'd ordered
that it comes with jalapenos hot sauce
they were like right can I have the
clicking hot St but with none of the hot
spicy stuff and we literally do that
that burger is a different like a
classic uh fried chicken burger so they
should have they could have just ordered
that but I just saw you know what I mean
people were just being like that
yesterday and I just thought oh just get
in the bin or when they order the hunter
chicken without the barbecue and the
cheese and I'm like well you might as
well just have grilled chicken
then
Hunter's chicken it's just chicken oh it
does have bacon on it as well it's
chicken smothered with barbecue sauce
cheese and bacon and and they're like oh
yeah can we have that but with no
barbecue sauce and no cheese it's like
you might as well just have grilled
chicken and add bacon onto it like
that's what people would like and
because my head was
so
congested and full of like just cold and
flu I just I couldn't deal with it I was
really struggling to like stay
professional with people that were just
asking a lot I could feel I know my face
was just like not impressed and I
thought I did feel bad to be fair I
wasn't very professional I was just
ill but I had
a temperature and
stuff the UK surpris me every day we
have some crazy food concoctions we do
we
do Hunters chickens a if you like that
kind of thing it's it's decent it's all
right it's not a go-to but it's it's
okay my dad used to make his own
actually like he used to do it us to
make it at home soz it's not difficult
but he used to make it really nice as
well back when he actually used to cook
I think he I don't think he does any
cooking now I think he just does all the
cleaning I'm going to make a yeah you
know what I'm going to
do to Amazon now and I'm going to have a
look at some uh packages of of just
different flavored
teas can you get a pack of just yeah you
can
actually um
cuz that sounds good and I think it'll
do me good herbal teas that's what I
need cuz they are supposed to be very
good green tea is really good for
you chamomile vanilla Manuka honey oh
Manuka Honey is very good for you packed
with like goodness that stuff
is oh there's 45 sachets so that's 45
drinks for 20 that's pretty good I think
nine different flavors 45
saches I'm not sure if I could drink
lavender tea though that sounds a bit
grim and I feel like it knocked me out
as
well get ginger tea right do you know
what I'll do I'll specifically get
ginger tea and then I'll try one of
these packages of like different
flavored teas as
well I did like the sound of that one
there and I thought that was really good
value as
well why are they so cheap that's really
good I think it's cuz they taste rank
but what have we got
here ear gray perfect
peppermint lemon Citrus and ginger that
one would be good as well then Super
berries white tea tropical
fruit chocolate Ry ruy boss what the
hell is that and vanilla lemon black tea
pure green
tea that's
£12 that's got 72 sachet in how is
that
sorry how do you get 72
sachets for 12 am I missing a trick
here
is there is there a reason that that is
so cheap like what what's going on and
then I will specifically get some ginger
tea as
well 80 tea bags why is this so cheap
guys this the math ain't math in here
I'm I'm not
complaining 18 tea bags of of spiced
ginger tea
for8 is it just me that think that's
really good you still sound ill I yeah I
am evidently still ill Joe it is no
um it is no secret that I am still
ill Yogi te is supposed to be nice they
do a ginger and
lemon that sounds like it ITW
wonders do we go for the Y did I just
got the 80 quid 88 quid imagine my just
spent 80 quid on te
Jesus and I will thank you uh
bbery when it does work wonders I think
they both so I've spent 20 pound on tea
there but I've got enough tea to last me
like
months there for 20 pound that's really
good but
72 hang
on let let me do the mathing 72 + 80 is
152 teabags
right that's like
what four five
months if I have one a
day that's a lot of
tea haven't been ill for ages I am
jealous check in again yeah you'll check
in again I'll be a different girl I'll
be sat here with a
glow hopefully lost like half a
stone I'll be bikini ready for my uh my
holiday to Mexico in September I'll be
loving life
yeah that's another reason I wanted to
try tea as well cuz it's good for like
weight loss and stuff um not all of it
but but some of them are pretty helpful
useful when you are dieting but 20 quid
for2 sachet of
tea I think that's pretty good and it's
coming tomorrow tomorrow 1: p.m.
tomorrow 700 p.m. I love Amazon so much
I love Amazon so much so good best
members ship I think I pay for like so
so
good right La Liga four and three
erid there's no way that we'll fit both
of them in we've got an 82 rated Kofi
bman out by the way this guy was like
what 56 rated or something when we
started
out uh play two RI Rivals again probably
for the best
though we'll do it we will do
it even provides free honestly Amazon
are just
great Plus threee movies
exactly I can watch The Walking
Dead I need to rewatch you know what
I've actually never never watched The
Walking Dead all the way through which
is crazy isn't it
probably I've watched the
first four five possibly six
seasons but that's
it
cd87 raid welcome in
Hayden how's it
going let me
uh let me check that out before we jump
into a
game just dropped a
sub appreciate the
raid thank you for the raid up to up to
some pro clubs as well love to see it
make sure you guys go and check out
cd87 go and drop him a sub if you
haven't done so
already I do appreciate it um I need to
get bber back into here play some games
with
bmer how' you get free packs from Amazon
uh so if you have Amazon Prime which is
a membership
but in my opinion it's well worth it um
with Amazon Prime you link your account
to your like PlayStation or yeah I think
it's just your EA account actually um
and you get free packs and you get like
additional uh other games as well free
content for other games I think Apex the
stuff with as well if you play Apex the
stuff on apex
um there's quite a lot there's quite a
few of the games that you get free bits
and exclusive content
on but yeah if you or like anyone in
your household has Amazon Prime and you
you know they don't mind you using it
you can you don't pay any extra it's
just if you if you already pay for
Prime and you link your EA account up to
to your Prime and then you go if you go
on prime. gaming or something like that
it should let you do it link it all up
and get it all set up and then yeah you
get a free pack also if you watch
anybody live on Twitch you get a uh free
sub so you can subscribe to your
favorite twitch streamer uh through
Amazon Prime so you can you know you
become a a twitch sub for free even
gives you free games too yeah it's
really
good that's what I mean it's such a good
uh such a good membership to
have do you get good players H it
depends to be fair the last few Prime
packs I I opened were a bit Nash
but it's free it's a free pack at the
end of the
day you know not guaranteed to get
something insane you've got as much
chance with you know any other pack but
you usually get like a loan did you did
you see that I had a loan mbappe so
you'll get like a loan a high rated card
or something like that or an icon or a
hero then you get like some player picks
as well uh and you get players as
well you usually get a bit of bit of
everything sometimes you can get like a
draft token in them as well well just
like bits of free stuff it's not insane
but I think I have packed I think in
FIFA
23 I pack modri a couple of I packed a
few
walkouts um from the prime Amazon Prime
par thank you so much for the raid CD
and welcome in as well I do hope you
stream went well was a Pro Club clubs
wasn't
it I hope pro clubs went
well not check the latest promo how's it
looking do you know what it's it's all
right to be fair I think following Team
of the Year is always going to be
difficult
um it's it's you know it's never going
to have the same hype as as Team of the
Year it's a road to the final so your
cards can get upgrades and stuff which
is nice um I've got some packs left over
from Team of the Year and for me
personally and where I'm at on this
account it's not really beneficial for
me the promo it's not you know so far
there's nothing that really benefits me
there's a a kimch SBC which I'm thinking
of doing he does look very good to be
fair he
does and I'm thinking about getting him
done but with regards to my packs I'm
just going to save them or save the
majority of them for future stars which
I think comes out next Friday
so that's that's my plan with uh with
that yeah thank you so much for the
raids today we've had the good Oak and
we've had CD as well make sure you do go
and check both of them out if you
haven't done so
yet it takes two seconds to click a link
and and drop somebody a sub so and it
really helps you know those other
streamers and content creators as
well
if you don't mind you feel like sparing
a couple of seconds feel free to do
so yeah that's what I'm that's what I'm
thinking hold out for future stars so
much good potential of future stars I've
got a very heavily Prem oriented team so
um lots of good prospects in the Premier
League you've got uh Mayu you've got um
Oscar B
Rob Cole Palmer I think is pretty much
confirmed that he's going to be a part
of future
stars
um who else was
there we talked about somebody else oh
Connor Connor Bradley from from
Liverpool lots of good lots of good
prospects and then you've got the women
side to the game as well and there's a
lot of good should be a lot of good
prospects there
too
sort it tomorrow yeah definitely have a
look into it get it sorted if you can
well worth it it'll be well worth
it us my favorite promos you get special
cards you don't normally get yeah
definitely you know you're looking at
cards they say like your Oscar Bobs and
and stuff are pretty low rated aren't
they they base cards they're normal
cards
so you're looking at getting cards like
that that are really good rated and and
you can actually use them into your team
so it's always an exciting promo I think
Future
Stars ask my M for my Amazon password no
worries yeah just get it all linked up
and then you can claim what you have to
do each month is log on to Prime gaming
and then claim your pack on the website
that way but it'll send it straight to
your console ready for you for next time
you log on if you're already on Ultimate
Team you might have to refresh like
close the game reopen it kind of thing
um yeah it's good it's worth getting
it's a free pack at the end of the
day
free packs a free
pack books going around there's a lot
going around Co doing the ring uh doing
the rounds again isn't
it my mom's got quite a few people at
her work that are off with
Co there's there's lots of stuff it's
just that time of the year the weather's
been weird it's been ridiculously cold
which usually viruses and colds and
stuff sort of thrive in cold
temperatures so you do get a lot more
and then for me I work in a pub so I'm
I'm constantly seeing people like all
day every day um it's yeah kind of
inevitable that I'm going to pick up
some germs and get ill from time to
time very I'm I'm close I've just come
out of like being a bit rundown as well
and a bit burnt out so my body naturally
is pretty like low
anyway bit
vulnerable yeah I'm going to get on this
health kick with my uh my healthy
teas just went clean my Prime pack
forgot about it I think I did
mine like for Team of the
Year I might have missed one though but
yeah don't forget forget those Prime PS
looking forward to not packing
May hopefully you do you never know you
might be an SBC or an
objective I think Palmer will be an SP
SPC I
reckon I don't think there's anybody
they could use from Arsenal
really I don't think Arsenal will get
one not in the men's Squad
anyway got a lot of good young talent
but they're not young
young they've had like Future Stars
cards
before good
go
