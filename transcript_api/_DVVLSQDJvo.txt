Liam we need to
talk when Omen didn't know about his
past he was contained a known entity we
kept him in the dark to protect both him
and us I had to light him he he tried to
kill me now he's starting to piece
things together and
I I can't anticipate his actions now
will he retaliate maybe leave the
protocol there are too many variables
out of my
control keep an eye on him she knew who
I was this whole time she knew so much
more than me why didn't she tell me why
couldn't she help does she think that
I'm some kind of
monster I will speak with her
soon but now I I need more time
Brimstone just know this I am not my
past
