Derek Ray and my commentary partner as
always is Stuart Robson and the Stag is
set for club's match action Stuart tell
us about your pre-match thoughts thanks
Derek well often we talk about the
tactics the individual players play
players that are missing but so often
it's the mentality of the players that
is key to winning any football game
which of these teams has the right
attitude today is the big
question
you and that's an important
intervention Jong
intense
[Applause]
pressure and that's very intelligent
play to win back
[Applause]
possession and they continue to advance
and a lot of options
here and credit is due for that good
piece of
[Applause]
Defending
[Applause]
Jong couldn't keep
[Applause]
it
canu well couldn't quite find his
[Applause]
teammate
Reed
Now read that pass all the way cutting
it out Advantage played could be
dangerous good work to regain
possession
GRE and snuffed out the danger
immediately the attack carries an
initial threat but fizzled out effective
press it's with
Blanco you
Lombardi de man can he play it in just
needs to get rid of
[Applause]
it
re
Jong Ã–zil went in strongly
decisively
canu
U
Lombardi
Yu well this looks really productive
what can they do from this
position play into the box well thumped
clear
The Defenders know you can't really
allow space like that and out of Play It
Goes unfortunately for
[Applause]
her
[Applause]
Jong H and cutting it
out
[Music]
pressure
applied Reed
now
Jong clear to see who got the last touch
so a throw in it'll
be a bit sloppy in
possession lot to like about that
pass oh it might be and a goal One n it
is they've been pushing for the opener
and now they have
it well as you can see this is a
wonderful strike he makes the perfect
connection and he has so much Pace on it
it's a great
goal so the match has restarted One n
here
Reed
now can they create something from
[Applause]
here
Jong and that was a very fine
[Applause]
read well that's I cuts it back Splendid
defending
[Applause]
well he's lost the
ball real chance and did just enough
defensively it should be and thating his
opponent in the nick of
[Applause]
time
Jong
[Applause]
Running With The Ball confidently but he
stumped it out of there without much
fuss well the story of the first half
has been written it's halime here in VI
[Applause]
doid
[Applause]
I
so back underway and an intriguing
second half in
[Applause]
Prospect genuine chance oh a Stella
piece of
Defending
[Applause]
Reed promising
[Applause]
pass
Reed Distributing it well
no Panic just passing surely stopped to
Sure Fire
[Applause]
goal unable to keep the
ball that's a good looking ball sound
piece of
goalkeeping he's found a pocket of
space but a good good piece of Defending
to bring it to an
end Reed
now well possession
seeded and support
available managed to get it out of there
oh he's found the net and that increases
the advantage to two just what they
wanted and just what they
deserve 2-0 now and back on
theway Reed
now can he get one
back and
oh great
vision giving the ball to the opposition
that
time oh lovely ball just needs to stay
calm superb
stop
[Applause]
green
Reed
now well can they open up the defense
here and quick thinking
defensively well giving it a go in a bit
to hold them back into this one well
they're knocking at the door here but
they need to score
[Applause]
soon superb looking
pass
cross could be useful oh yes a goal
exactly what they were looking for and
he's come up with
it this is looking rather comfortable
for them 3
[Applause]
n cleared away over the by line and a a
kick to
[Applause]
come trying to pick out a teammate well
to be blunt misfiring with the
[Applause]
header
[Applause]
Ibrahimovic a good Vision
there they've won back
[Applause]
possession
Reed
now and giving it
away
canu poor pass under no no real
pressure a very effective challenge put
in attacking with
Vigor opportunity
here oh a stellar piece of
Defending well nearly there this game
almost over and looking at the F Stuart
they appear to me to be more than a bit
gutted well where do I start they've
been totally outplayed in all areas of
hang on Stuart it's a chance and there
it is a goal but will it be purely a
consolation at the stage of the
proceedings they haven't been at the
best well as you can see what a good bit
of play this is the buildup is excellent
one and two touch passing clever
movement and a fairly simple finish
great team goal giving the ball away
good through
[Applause]
ball giving it a real go in the wide
area and the shot and did just enough
[Applause]
defensively the referee knew that was
Foul Play but Advantage it is
that's a good
ball mopping up
[Applause]
defensively so 2 minutes of stoppage
time here promising
[Applause]
pass and that's an important
intervention and there goes the final
whistle much to the disappointment of
theirs to grips with the game they
always seem second to the ball and then
just a few mistakes at the back and it's
cost them poor performance all
around
there
a city alive with the spirit of
excitement and a stadium brimming with
anticipation the buildup has been
intense and now we just can't wait for
it all to begin it's anyone's guess
though which team will come out on
top find out how it unfolds right here
on
[Music]
eatv
good evening and welcome ahead of what
should be a pulsating night of football
I'm Derek Ray and joining me to provide
expert analysis is Stuart Robson and
it's going to be fascinating to see how
these two sides Fair as they come up
against each other how do you see it
panning out Stuart well thanks Derek the
best coach I played under would always
tell us before kick up earn the right to
play if you can win your individual
battles outrun your opponent eventually
you'll get the space to show your
ability I'm sure that's being echoed by
the coaches here
today and teammates to play it to well
he read that brilliantly at the
back and they'll get ready for the throw
[Applause]
in now can he get on the end of this one
oh fantastic effort he made great
contact but the keeper more than equal
to it
Jong decent looking
pass what can he do with it
now well that takes the wind out of
their sails great
defending and it crossed the touch line
so a throw in
here and it took a little Nick before it
went over the touch line so a throw in
here clears it
away
Mastery of the passing
game and options in the
[Applause]
[Music]
center he's got
[Music]
space ler to the center not the best
clearance but it just P out
can they create something from
here a fine reading of the
[Applause]
situation from one side of the pitch to
The
Other Well that one has
[Applause]
promise really good buildup but no end
product so a throw in here
well that shouldn't really happen from a
throw
[Applause]
in looking for that final pass looking
for the goal that would put them
ahead a chance to whip it
[Applause]
in and that's an important intervention
[Applause]
in greed
but he needs to be careful
here and a tidy
tackle and the Defenders know they need
to get tighter well disappointing end to
the
[Applause]
move
Jong now they've lost
it and back with
Alvarez the attack looks
promising well he has players waiting at
the back post chance maybe and a goal
well it looks easy when you can put them
away like like
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
that so the ball rolling again with the
score line standing at 1-
n
[Applause]
Jong losing possession a bit
easily
[Applause]
[Music]
hero opportunity here oh he wasn't
necessarily favorite to win that
challenge and he's knocked it out of
play so a throw in is the decision he
has time to play it over well it was
pretty straightforward for the
goalkeeper oh the keeper needed to do an
awful lot better what can they do from
here so almost at the break here and not
quite going to plan for the home side
work to do Stewart well it's been a
tight first half so far but they haven't
quite shown enough gu in the attack in
third if however they can be more
dynamic in the 1 V1 situations they have
the quality to turn this
around well they might be trailing but
hope in the form of a
[Applause]
corner who can they pick
out and a good take under duress
[Applause]
there
green that's a lovely ball delivered
into the box oh we have just witnessed a
special moment pure
quality well when you see this again
it's just magnificent look at that for a
bit of skill that's a wonderful
goal
back underway level begging one goal a
piece in this game that's a good
ball oh a really untiy loss of
possession and a goal just like that the
back in
front well here's the replay and that's
the perfect outcome right into the
corner and in off the post that's a very
good
goal so back underway intriguing contest
this given the 2-1 score
line well there it is the halime whistle
is sounded we're at the Midway Point
here at the estadio Jose
[Applause]
Soria
[Applause]
wo let's
[Applause]
see
well they've got things going again here
and I wonder what kind of second half we
have in store for
[Applause]
us Reed now
[Applause]
well read to win possession
[Applause]
back oh great vision well the decision
is offside and he's bound to be a bit
disappointed he's actually made his run
before his teammate had control of the
ball and that's why it's
offside well a classic example of how to
intercept
Jong and quick thinking defensively the
assistant referee has raised as flag
[Applause]
offside well they've given him too much
[Applause]
space well that's how to put in a clean
tackle and the referee playing
Advantage everyone wants to see
officials let the play flow in that
manner but now the free kick has to be
awarded and they will be awarded a free
kick for
[Applause]
that Reed now well nicely cut out now
what can they do with the
ball Now options are plenty
well it came to nothing in the
end well good run and good ball control
beautiful
[Applause]
pass
Ã–zil incisive pass oh the flag's gone up
and there wasn't much in that
well we're into the final half
[Applause]
hour
Jong and a throw in fourth
coming and he's taken it away
[Applause]
Reed very alert defending to cut off the
[Applause]
supply Alvarez now delightful
pass
oh fancy footwork superbly read and
[Applause]
executed
[Applause]
heril now the pass not finding its
Target and ENT the last 20
minutes Reed
[Applause]
now
[Applause]
Jong see some progress with the ball at
his feet well he is capable of producing
much better deliveries than that
[Applause]
one and back with Alvarez vital
intervention oh he's left his marker for
dead and a significant block following
that
cross dangerous ball well not away
properly it's there for
him oh crucial tackle
brilliant well the fans are certainly
playing their part here just listen to
this
noise
and cutting it
out and a fine piece of goalkeeping
which keeps the hopes alive well you
right that keeps them in it but can they
find an equalizer they need some urgency
in their
play Jong good
[Applause]
idea and a fine tackle
this attack looks highly promising takes
it on oh it's off the
post it was an attack of promise but
they couldn't take advantage of the
situation well that would have made
short of a welld deserved Victory but
they're not quite there
[Applause]
yet well no point in stopping play
Advantage with them
Jong
heril oh they have it
again can he finish them off he's done
it what a climax to this
[Applause]
game no shortage of goals in this match
3-1 and there goes the final whistle
much to the disappointment of their
support
to refocus now and perform better next
time
[Applause]

for committed Challenge and the referee
blows for a
foul oh it was a crucial challenge
[Applause]
Aguero that's a good ball and a good
take under duress
there
Jong Reed now moving the ball forward
how creative can they
be and in a perfect position to cut it
[Applause]
out it's looking
promising
maybe determined defending and the
verdict of the officials is offside well
he just gets caught ball watching here
needs to be more alive work harder to
keep on site and be ready for the
chance really good build up but no end
[Applause]
product throw in
given
from one side of the pitch to the
other good looking sequence but it
Fizzles out thanks to that piece of
Defending Reed
now
Ã–zil
well nothing for them to worry about in
the end good
defending still Level here but the
pressure escalating well they were very
patient but they no longer have the
[Applause]
ball
Jong
Ã–zil
[Applause]
Reed
now they've regained
possession and played the pass
well cross could be useful well the
chance appeared to be on but he found
himself offside well he was just too
anxious wasn't he that's not good
play
Jong
[Applause]
Ã–zil oh moving it nicely well possession
seated released it
nicely a chance to whip it in
just knocked it out of there well a
chance here perhaps to invigorate their
aerial
[Applause]
targets can he deliver it with
[Applause]
accuracy
[Applause]
oh crucial tackle
brilliant Benning
Housen did well to win the ball
back bellinghausen that is how to apply
the
[Applause]
pressure that's a very impressive piece
of
Defending B played
nicely will he play it
[Music]
in clear Foul Play and as a result a
free kick
[Applause]
forthcoming and a good looking ball
clattered
away
Reed we saw the situation
developing well possibilities in the
[Applause]
center
well there is going to be stoppage time
but only the one
minute good looking ball there could be
a chance
now he gots it back reading it
well oh body in the way crucially well
no problems
defensively referee whistle then halime
here at the IO Jose
[Applause]
[Applause]
Soria
away they go again second half is
underway here
[Applause]
Reed and possession given
away really closing him down
here
mavuba really good good
challenge now the counter attack looks
on they need to get bodies back well
they couldn't quite use that break in
the manner that they'd
helped well those stats aren't great
reading are they neither side is playing
with any fluency so far and as a result
we've seen a pretty dull game it has to
get
better
def
and offside by rather a
[Applause]
lot
[Applause]
Reed chance to attack using
wit can he play it
in some of the fans are screaming have a
go good patient build up as they try to
Fashion
[Applause]
something but then the one that fails to
hit its Target can they hit on the
break
Jong
breed well that's s to put in a clean
tackle now we're into the final half
[Applause]
[Music]
hour Reed
[Applause]
now
Reed showing real patience can they
Forge
ahead not a promising looking attack but
comes to nothing in the
end must take the lead here and
precision was lacking well that's a big
chance to put them in front but she has
to be more
clinical options in the center
well trying to place it but without any
great success well maybe went for the
wrong technique if he'd have hit it with
power may have got a better result
that's a poor effort
really
def teammates
[Music]
available now he must favor the
cross well sadly a bit of a tame effort
that one and far too close to the
[Applause]
[Music]
goalkeeper
[Applause]
Reed well not a great ball played in
well there's defensive solidity for
you
he's enjoying
space cross fired over not away
completely well able to survive that
attacking push committed
[Applause]
challenge good wait on that
[Applause]
pass Reed
now
well that's how to outwit your
[Applause]
opponent just cutting off the
supply just 10 minutes remaining
here and forcing the
error and a go oh at this stage of the
game it might be decisive and just look
at their
[Applause]
supporters what a big moment in the
dying Embers will it prove decisive
here
heril 5 minutes remaining and one thing
is certain no one is leaving because
it's still
[Applause]
close
Jong losing
possession can he find the right pass
well time is of some concern can they
level matters clear Foul Play and as a
result a free kick forth
[Applause]
coming
mauba
Aguero that's a lovely
ball the inside route looks promising
able to get his body in the
way pretty comfortable piece of
Defending and that is the end of the
game game it goes into the history books
as a home defeat yes Derek it was a
tight game between two very good sides
but they lost concentration late on and
it's cost them dearly they'll need to
get over that
[Applause]
quickly
for
this is when it really hits home kickoff
time almost upon us a colossal Game
featuring two teams who demonstrably
belong on the big stage we know they can
deliver but will they do it with the
pressure on and the fans wired
[Music]
in the action comes your way next on EA
[Applause]
TV and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be enthralling I'm
your match commentator Derek Ray at the
microphone and sitting alongside me is
real chance what an important piece of
Defending
untiy on the
ball Crossing
possibilities it's a perfect
challenge it's with
Aro and now back with the
keeper
[Applause]
and back with
pinto and whipped into the
box clears it
away
and foul it is
[Applause]
then well showing good
vision and it's played into the
center he succeeds in clearing
it oh great vision
over the touch line for a throw
[Applause]
in options in the center I'll tell you
what that is really Top Class
defending on the pass was just that
little bit off nearly found its
[Applause]
Target it's with
[Applause]
Aro clattered
[Applause]
away well they have the advantage that's
good
[Applause]
refereeing
Jong he could pick out a
teammate oh nice ball over the top to
Chase and it's gone behind for the
[Applause]
corner now sending it in on the corner
far too close to the
[Applause]
goalkeeper
what a brilliant
pass
[Applause]
kedo dangerous ball under pressure can
he finish oh he's blocked
[Applause]
it playing it in well not away
[Applause]
properly we dealt with that ball
comfortably and the defensive
intervention
there kaiso with
it
Yahya it looks
promising and they need to get tighter
here very alert defending to put a stop
to the
[Applause]
chance again they couldn't keep
[Applause]
it
[Applause]
Pino
[Applause]
Ã¶ on the
offensive can they Forge ahead they do
and you've got to say they're good value
for the
lead well just look at how poor the
defending is here but I have to say it's
still a very tidy finish he looked
really assured
there the ball is moving once more how
important will that opening goal prove
to
[Applause]
be and Pino
[Applause]
now promising looking ball and that is
[Applause]
offside
using space on the opposite flank
now well that'll be a free
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
kick so nearly at half time and the
homeside trailing or be it not by much
Stuart your thoughts up to this point
well been a tight first half so far but
they haven't quite shown enough G in the
attacking third if however they can be
more dynamic in the 1 V1 situations they
had the quality to turn this
around well that's one for them to
pursue really getting stuck
in oh is he going to be punished
here absolutely spot on with that
challenge
heril well they're on the scent of
something
positive and a decent
delivery and stopping the
danger this could be
Troublesome well great read there to
intercept
options in the
[Applause]
center and that is going to be all for
the first half here at the estadio Jose
Soria in
[Applause]
violi
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
w
[Applause]
so back underway and an intriguing
second half in
Prospect
[Applause]
vigorous defending and the keeper more
than equal to the
task and it crossed the touch line so a
throw in
here
a spot on with that
challenge decent looking pass took a
really smart piece of Defending to stop
them a good eff of pressure high up the
[Applause]
pitch
well they have it
again great
opportunity spectacular sa top class
goalkeeping can he apply the
Finish oh did so well to deny
him
really good
[Applause]
interception well this looks really
productive what can they do from this
position can he do it oh that is a
majestic goal Voli home with precision
and style superbly
done
well the pass not finding its
Target it's with
Aro and back to the
keeper
kooo
yahiya and making sure there was no
danger in the
end
definitely look as though they want to
make this move
count but quick thinking
[Applause]
[Applause]
defensively
kooo
[Applause]
Aro
oh good looking
run Crossing
possibilities simple for the
[Applause]
keeper
Jong well it's a tall order as they
tried to pull one back but the passing
game might help but then the one that
goes
[Applause]
astray
kooo
[Applause]
Aro Yahya but attacking possibilities
but really sticking to the task
[Applause]
defensively
oh nice ball over the top and offside it
is a quarter of an hour remaining
here it's with
Aro Distributing it
well oh the threat is there oh could be
and taken cleanly by the
goalkeeper there's
possession Changing
Hands able to skip past as
man oh he saved it
well good ball to switch the
[Applause]
play
plenty of players waiting in the
middle well that header was never going
to be problematic for the
goalkeeper well nearly there this game
almost over and looking at the fans
Stewart they appear to me to be more
than a bit gutted well there are two
main reasons why they're losing this
game firstly they've not shown enough
desire to close the opposition down and
secondly they haven't defended their box
well enough it's been a poor defensive
display and that is how to beat your
opponent opportunity to deliver the
cross he succeeds in clearing
it and good use of Advantage the ref
referee allowing play to continue good
distribution great challenge he got
nothing but
ball and we will have just one
additional minute and he's broken
free was it the denial of a clear goal
scoring opportunity if so he's off and a
red card it is denial of a clear goal
scoring opportunity well as soon as he
made the tackle he knew the outcome
that's an easy decision for the
referee
he's got to have a go here oh what an
Exquisite goal absolute
perfection and that is the end of the
game it goes into the history books as
