hello in this video I'm going to show
you how you can fist bump in League of
Legends all you need to do is press U
key on your keyboard after pressing it
you will see a fist above your head the
fist will be closed for several seconds
if there is no one near you who would
also use this emote the fist will show
the thumbs up gesture instead otherwise
if someone uses this emote with you
after a few seconds there will be the
fist bump animation and that's it thanks

videos bye
