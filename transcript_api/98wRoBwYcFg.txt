hours or something in CS and 90% of that
is into skins on the right we got a game
that copied the game on the left yeah if
I would copy paste CS just like that

different Community boys I'm not proud
of it either not going to lie these are
going to be first raw Impressions bro

the operator all the VOR people don't
understand in CS go you have an OP what
does Valen call their sniper rifle that
is the same they call it operator op can
you drop me the op AK operator they did
that on purpose to make the transition

time to check your settings no skin

Sentinels of light do I support the
organization Sentinels then I'm not
buying it does Sentinels get a cut of

free and bundle that's such a scam bro
what do you mean how much is this
$8,700 let me guess $8 we got cool y
these reps are all right we have aing
free Banner knife 4,000 okay so knife is
the most this probably like four bucks
let me click on buy
um
what
nine
$80 guys I'm not even trolling I would
have bet so much money that it's $8 and
not 80
$87 for one bundle guys that's a knife
that I can buy in Counter Strike that I
can resell at any time for the same
amount of money I can get my money back
and I and I I played with it life yeah I
can I lose some money on the fee right
on the selling fee but you already know
usually skins prices go up sometimes
they go down $80 you put to the dumpster
bro CH I refuse to play that nah $100
this cost $40 bro not even kidding
valorent is getting away with robbery
because of the CS2 economy right because
they know that people that are into
Counter Strike some of them will come
over to valorent and they know about oh
this knife cost $1,000 this one costs
$500 and now they can get away withing
robbery and people don't understand that
you can just sell a CS go skin this
wouldn't be $40 if CS go wasn't a thing

bro we take that though we take that
though what agents do I have oh hell no
why the [ __ ] do I have nothing unlocked
can I buy some agents Chad what's the
one that I need what's one that is raw
aim I'm a good Tapper in CS I'm the best
with the AK k k c cou k and why is this
one pure aim what's this gu's ultimate
or something I need something easy to
work with like a good ultimate try it
out in range let me see how how how how
how kuou let me see what he's got press
F1 fragment equip an explosive fragment
fire to throw alt fire to lob okay so
it's a h grenade chew Flash nice try
flash grenade okay boom is this the
slimy one or ah classic the Windows
Movie Maker flash we got C which is an H
grenade what the [ __ ] is that why is the
HG pulsing then we got
e uh okay throwing knives um and then we
got ax which is instantly overload with
polarized radiant energy that Pulses
from Kyo massive radius enemies with
pulse are
suppressed walks away which means they
can't use abilities right but they can
still shoot okay okay okay
skins it's going to be the same shop
no it's the same wait it's not the same
shop ah so these things are different
chat what the [ __ ] is this now that's
kind of cool
actually no I remember watching the
video
chat
this one I said was kind of cool bro nah
that's kind of
niceo for game like valoren don't get me
wrong that is nice do I buy that bundle
bro what the [ __ ] just for nine chat is
just the P250 $17 or can I apply the
skin on
everything you got to be Chad I hope you
understand how valoren is getting away
with robbery bro because of the [ __ ]
C economy and people are so used to
paying [ __ ] 100 bucks for P250 or
seeing those prices they can get away
with this if CS go wouldn't exist this
is so crazy $17 for one gun look at
fortnite if you get a weapon rep it's
for everything and you pay what $4 that
is insane bro are people never
complaining about that how expensive
Skins are that is ridiculous bro this
bundle cost so much wait so it's just
the
one but not it's just the Phantom
no no $30 for one Phantom shut up this
is insane I'm baffled and if you say oh
my God yeah but if AK 57 cost 500 bucks
you can't compare the two you should
compare to fortnite where you pay five
bucks for a [ __ ] shiny [ __ ] weapon
finish that you can apply on your rocket
launcher on the car on the boat on
everything on one gun so what if I want
this skin on every gun I need to wait
for the [ __ ] shop and then I need to
pay [ __ ] for every skin first time sh
I welcome to V bro I didn't know that it
was like this like I'm actually stun
locked bro yeah now bro if I see some
people in game like I can actually I'm
not going to clown on them for having
spent 30 bucks on a [ __ ] Phantom but
I'm going to talk to them I'm going to
ask if they're millionaires already like
what's going on bro that's actually a
scam I thought fortnite skins were
expensive but Valen Skins are completely
like it's like League of Legends you
have to pay for every ability skin or
something for your C to look like this
for this to look like that for the AK
you have to buy a skin for the op nah
