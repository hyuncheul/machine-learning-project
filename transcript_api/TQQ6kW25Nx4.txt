ever let them get inside your head
they'll tell you what to do in life
instead of everything you know that you
could get
don't let them guide your life towards
your gret I'll fight for what I love
with every breath my past is fill with
things I won't
forget I use them all to push me to my
best so treat the worst of times just
like a test if only I could go back in
time I tell myself that everything will
end up all right just push yourself test
yourself figure out what you like and
find your limits don't be rigid always
work towards a prime surround yourself
with open mind people can change your
life a few friends with intent can help
you feel alive find the passion take
some action and with a little time just
be patient make a statement try to enjoy
your life they'll try to kick you while
you're
down they want to rise up while you
drown they want to fill your head with
doubt they're silently scared that

losing won't bother hiding my bruising
and when they finally think you won't
get then it's your chance to be
ruthless you CH to be
