oh W what the that was so
[Music]
weird they popped the [ __ ] off holy
[ __ ] oh my God that is one of the best
cinematics they've ever done oh that
that I'm so that makes up for 2023 that
make I'm sorry to me that makes up for
2023 Al that we're getting Arcane this
year all makes up for 2023 it
yes I oh my god I've gone feral I've
gone feral
I there is so they put like all my
favorite [ __ ] in there you've got to be
kidding me wow I'm still trying to
figure out who the older dude was though
he kind of had powers like yazo but it's
definely not
yazo but I'm trying to figure out who it
was say nothing law wise has happened
trying to think who it was I didn't
recognize them I mean I haven't
obviously gone through all the league
champions yet but
H I don't know okay okay we're going to
have to break this down a little bit
okay so obviously we had trendir
obviously they had had a fight and they
hadn't gone very well the metaphors
we're going to get back to this I'm
sorry right this shot here holy [ __ ] the
quality like you you literally can see
the paws in his
nose it's beautiful it's beautiful where
is my movie of this like where's the
movie I needs I needs it I needs it I
needs a whole movie of this [ __ ] and
then little hint there and then we
obviously had Morana and kale versus
atro what a [ __ ] goated fight like
and the when Kale did that move
basically once in League I mean I'm sure
you guys have already played it so I
don't want to explain too much to you
but basically I I play kale so once
you've kind of leveled kale up enough
she gets to the point where she
literally just gets jeel swords out she
has all wings burst and she just does
this to [ __ ] everyone it is glorious
it is so much [ __ ] fun it's worth the
pain of the beginning of it because she
is absolutely the squidges thing at the
beginning of a game but you build her up
near the end oh it's worth it it's worth
it it's so much fun just hitting
everyone with this it's so good so
having that move here
just made my heart sing I'm not going to
lie when we saw trendir I kind of
thought we were going to get trendir
versus like atrox maybe which also made
me really excited because I've been
wanting to see that far fight for a long
time but this was so worth it so so good
I do wonder why kale and morgano are
fighting side by side so I do wonder the
law text of this and whether or not this
is going to be something we get more law
on this year because as far as I'm aware
the last thing we knew about kale was
that she had gone off with their mother
and then
Morana well as far as were was just
still you know going around so they
weren't together or made up or anything
you know so law wise I don't quite know
where this sits but oh it's exciting
it's very exciting oh I do wonder I
wonder if like maybe like kale comes
back after the stuff that goes down with
her mom oh I don't know that's it was so
good though it was so oh just seeing
them and just the look right this moment
the look that kale gives
her that judgy look oh she's oh that
look of judgment you know like that's
kale 100% the stank face cuz she doesn't
like Morana using those powers like
that oh so good just those little
details if you know the law oh so so
cool this character I don't know who
they are so you guys are going to have
to explain this one to me for a there's
a name in my head that I it's not quite
coming to focus
but oh I don't know I don't know like
Yin something
maybe M you got think you guys are going
have to explain this one to me cuz this
this character is I'm going to kick
myself when you guys tell me I'm going
to be like I'm such an idiot I should
have known that but yeah I don't know
this character super Wells I've clearly
not gone over their law and then the
this this I mean the kale Morgana atrox
fight was incredible but this was the
highlight trendir literally fighting
death the
metaphorical gorgeousness that was this
fight stunning one of the best things in
cinematics for League of Legends that
they've done in a long long time this
was [ __ ] amazing I I have no words
the m just seeing Kindred
there I got chills like [ __ ] yes yes
what a [ __ ] thing to put in here and
then having then having like ash appear
right at the end and his like eyes faded
and everything just oh this
moment oh love it it's just my
heart it's so sweet it's so sweet if you
guys don't know these two are
engaged oh my heart just saged like this
look he's giving her he's so relieved to
see her and she's relieved that he's
okay and it's just
like I love it I love it so much I'm so
happy this cinematic was [ __ ] amazing
I'm so happy
2023 that one just that one that one do
exist we're going to pretend that one
