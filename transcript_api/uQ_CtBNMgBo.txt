[Music]
for let you P us I don't know
[Music]
what
and hello to you from Clyde side we find
ourselves on the south side of this
great City Glasgow I'm Derek Ray getting
ready to bring you all the action
accompanied by my broadcasting partner
Stuart Robson and ready to bring you the
decisive second leg of this UEFA Europa
conference League quarterfinal tie it's
Rangers up against Tottenham hbur well
Derek Tottenham might have a two-goal
lead but this won't be easy today this
could be a really tight battle
particularly if they concede an early
goal oh he's really opened them up here
and he's gone for power so close to
finding the
[Applause]
net this is the starting lineup for
Tottenham Hotspur Ugo laice is the
goalkeeper davson Sanchez plays
alongside Clore longlay in central
defense and rather than use a strike
partnership they've gone with just the
one player in
attack
well no stopping him can he open the
door to a potential
goal no foul Spurs
Advantage
kuluski cl to attack from the wide
[Music]
areas he could pick out a
teammate and possibilities
here a fine block
a glorious chance he's foiled them on
his
own well this is the day his debut
forthcoming and it's going to be
fascinating to see what he produces
Stuart what do you think we should
expect to see from him well he's a good
player no doubt about that and he will
certainly improve their Midfield I just
hope he settles in quickly and shows us
what an effect he can have on this
[Applause]
team now potential Danger
[Applause]
hiier magnificent
[Applause]
defending
Bon is it going to be well the opted for
power from close range he might be
regretting that
now
[Applause]
anastasios bakasetas
on the
offensive but nothing comes of it good
defending it
was
longle now
son Dean
kuski not can they open up the defense
here could play it
in
[Applause]
hiier Ryan
[Applause]
Jack turns here it's still alive and he
didn't hesitate good thing too well he's
so quick off his line that's great
goalkeeping you have to
say Spurs get the advantage from the
referee well he's given his
[Applause]
away that's really good and effective
physical
[Applause]
play and on the back of that particular
challenge will the referee let the
matter rest
[Applause]
there really meat and drink to the
keeper under the
circumstances
[Applause]
hiier an awful lot of Green Space to run
into well if only he had Ed his run
slightly better
[Applause]
offside straight out of play by the
goalkeeper and it'll be a throw
[Applause]
in and very deathly cut
out that's the kind of shielding play
you expect from
[Applause]
him
oh good play this but no damage done
that's the main
[Applause]
thing it should be you'll be hard
pressed to find a better save than that
lorice
oh trying to pick out a teammate and
they deal with the threat this
time and he takes on the shot a routine
[Applause]
save
Hunter they need to get
tighter Crossing
possibilities
hiier real chance and just narrowly wide
in the
[Applause]
end and a good challenge to bring that
attack to an
[Applause]
end anastasios bakasetas
[Applause]
and Spurs moving the ball with
purpose and the keeper more than equal
to the
task not a huge chunk of added time one
minute
[Applause]
son and there it is the halim
whistle
[Music]
so back underway and an intriguing
second half in
[Applause]
Prospect a very good
tackle Hunter
now he must favor the
cross s oh my well a piece of quick
Thinking by The Keeper well that's great
goalkeeping he read it so well didn't
[Applause]
he Rangers doing well to regain
[Applause]
possession
lundstrom has a go tremendous block
well this is certainly the home of live
football eatv and looking forward to
bringing you more action from the
Premier League it's Tottenham Hotspur
facing wolver Hampton
Wanderers a good and fair
[Applause]
challenge
chak
lrom
and the decision is one of offside
here they will now make use of their
substitutes
bench well read to win possession
back
Kamar bakasetas with
it can he finish and putting his body on
the
line
Kamar
lundstrom well it looked highly
promising but they got nothing out of
it
Hunter Jed
Spence well Spur's now in potentially a
dangerous
[Applause]
position oh surely oh wonderful
goalkeeping well you have to say from
that sort of distance that's a wonderful
save playing it in and it goes the goal
for 1 n and that changes the
[Applause]
dynamic well let's look at this again
it's a decent delivery into the box
which makes it a fairly simple finish in
the end it's a really good goal pry
convincing looking aggregate score of 3-
[Applause]
n
[Applause]
hiier now what can they produce on the
flank and the cross not sufficiently
well played in sub for to Spur to make a
Personnel switch now 2
DJ number can someone get on the end of
this not really the ideal
clearance that's how to do it inside
your own penalty
[Applause]
area
[Applause]
sakala
Hunter
son well it could be on for him
here and up for grabs off the keeper and
it goes at the second time of asking and
the keeper feels hung out to
dry it's turned into a runaway on
aggregate
4N
fashion
sakala
lundstrom briyan Kent has it tremendous
intuition to win it
back 20 minutes
remaining just to let you know the C
shot is open after today's game if you
like to get your tickets for the next
game or
merchandise LR
is it going to
be well denied by The Keeper but really
he only has himself to
blame
hiier
Hunter throw in here for Spurs
Rodrigo and number 34 CL llit coming
onto the pitch number 18 gavani LEL and
number 38
Eesa tremendously strong in the
tackle
lundstrom fashion
[Applause]
sakala and he takes it
[Applause]
away and teammates around
[Applause]
him wonderful Challenge and a throw in
coming up off the substitution time it
is
here James
Taver couldn't hang on to the ball and
the Counterattack is on options
available well that break looked so
promising but nothing coming from it
[Applause]
Running With The Ball confidently he'll
be breathing a s of relief ball
[Applause]
one real chance and disappointingly not
even close to hitting the target there
yeah it was looking to open up his body
guide into the corner but he's got it
all wrong it's a poor attempt in the
end f minutes
[Applause]
left
hiier well he's given as
[Applause]
away
lrom well he didn't miss by all that
much well he struck it quite nicely but
the keeper was always in control of the
situation he knew that was going
wide Hunter
and H beer with
[Applause]
it
Martinez
galdo can he put it in oh goodness me
off the
post threat over for now it
seems
there it is the final whistle and Spurs
go marching on well it was never really
in doubt was it over the two legs they
were oh he's really opened them up
[Music]
here in the street they call it
m
rock with the
[Music]
and
your
your your girlfriend
contact this come around like on the
beach with a few
CL stories and like CH and know the
real the do got and
twice don't make unless
[Music]
[Music]
car get like
a top
real interest in Gonzalo gch four goals
in three games you can't argue and hello
to you from molu here in the English
West Midlands I'm Derek Ray and keeping
me company in the commentary box today
is of course Stuart Robson and it's all
about action from the Premier League in
this case it's wolver Hampton Wanderers
up against Tottenham hbur thanks Derek
well often we talk about the tactics the
individual players players that are
missing but so often it's the mentality
of the players that is key to winning
any football game which of these teams
has the right attitude today is the big
question the initial 11 for wolves dric
boata plays with Willie B in central
defense and the striker of choice today
is Gonzalo
G and that's easy peasy for the
[Applause]
keeper
chanu now
son
galdo throw in for wolves
[Applause]
here Yan
yordan in possession
Adama Galo
Gage well read to put an end to that
attack will he play it
[Music]
[Applause]
in well we can say it officially now
we'll be watching the Champions today
the title secured in the last match what
a terrific position to be in Stuart well
they can certain enjoy this one Derek
what a great season they've had they've
been the best team in the league no
doubt about that for
me
pratesi Galo
[Applause]
Gish able to get a body in the
[Applause]
way
Puma that's a lovely
ball and space to cross it
Top Class
defending a corner will
ensue who can they pick
out chanu can he finish
this could be ideal for the goalkeeper
for any
keeper well I think understandable that
many of us in the media were very
interested in j moutinho ahead of
today's game the rumors have been
confirmed he has elected to win oh
they're in here
Derek well I think Fair de say Stewart
not one for his personal scrapbook well
that's really Wayward his technique
completely let him down
there
Hunter
[Applause]
chanu very much run of a mill as saves
go Gonzalo gch extremely sloppy in
[Applause]
possession Hunter well it could be on
for him
here it's got to be and a goal to give
them the lead they have their
reward well as you can see he doesn't
mess about here does he he's strong well
balanced and skillful that's a top class
finish back in Action then a wake up
call for wolves perhaps can they find a
response Eric
Dyer Eve at be sua has it
chanu nicely cut
out Gibbs
white onto gch body in the way body in
the way
again just like to send a special
message to Tony Rankin today happy
Birthday Tony everybody loves you and is
thinking about you this looks
promising options in the
center
Son Well showing excellent judgment to
intercept can they hit on the
break rosaro
[Applause]
Gish
[Applause]
Puma halime coming up Spurs leading here
Stuart your overall take well I think
they've been the better side in this
first half defended well they've looked
dangerous in attack and they've
controlled the Midfield it's been a
solid performance so
[Applause]
far disappointing for wolves to give it
away like that and he couldn't quite get
himself back on side Stewart well as a
player you need to be able to change
your mind but he wasn't able to and
that's a poor
[Applause]
pass
[Applause]
Hunter
galdo and
sa oh right in the nick of
time
Hunter element of risk there but he's
won the
[Applause]
ball
[Applause]
Puma can they create something from
here oh that's an interesting
[Applause]
pass just unable to take advantage of
that developing
situation
vuma now with
s that is a very fine challenge in
difficult
circumstances
there will be one minute added on at the
end Gonzalo
[Applause]
G and there it is the referee's whistle
we've reached the halfway point here
[Applause]
at
well Advantage Tottenham after the first
45 minutes but a long way from being
decided might really be able to trouble
them
here a really top-notch piece of
[Applause]
Defending what a genuine opportunity but
it was squandered k
kick and with play stop they will make
the change
[Applause]
now Dean
kuluski well there to intercept and
wolves looking
dangerous and he takes it on but it
wasn't a taxing
[Applause]
save well that's not great reading is it
they've created a lot of chances that's
not been the problem but the finishing
has been really poor and unless they can
improve in the top third of the pitch
it's going to be a really frustrating
day for
them now they're going to alter things
here's the
substitution this looks more than
decent and he's certainly in the mood
for his second well he's certainly
looking a threat he looked so sharp
today and he's fired over the corner
well not the best clearance
excellent assessment of the situation at
the
back we always enjoy bringing you live
action on eatv and Premier League action
coming up it's Wolves facing Southampton
well the fixtures are coming thick and
fast it should be a good game that
hopefully I've not just given it the
commentator's curse oh great
defending
[Applause]
raldo and return to
son and a good challenge to bring that
attack to an
[Applause]
end Ruben
Nas
and possession given
away oh he's left as marker for dead
hanano Gish oh that's textbook
goalkeeping both managers deciding this
is the time to change things around both
teams going to the
bench they couldn't take advantage of
the
chance number 38 good work to win the
ball back high up the pitch number
supporters making themselves Hur now
just the tackle that was
[Applause]
needed
chanu bodies forward and the break looks
on well delighted to say more Premier
League action coming up for you here on
EA TV it's Spurs facing
Bournemouth oh Bree in past
him sound piece of
goalkeeping
Adama Gonzalo G
now
[Applause]
pens and he read it well intercepting
it might be able to set up the
[Applause]
chance
[Applause]
son at the ready son has done it he
really is a true force of
nature well here's the replay and just
look how quickly they break forward once
they win the ball back and then from
that sort of range son was never going
to miss it's a Well workor
goal so two n
now
[Applause]
hiier and Spurs showing good
wi he's got the right idea with that
pass oh good work to deny the
[Applause]
opportunity who can they pick
[Applause]
out pressing High to win the the
ball he must finish really good diving
[Applause]
[Music]
save and he made the catch Under
[Applause]
Pressure plenty of players waiting in
the
middle
now we're inside the final 10 minutes in
this
one they're getting right on top of
their opponents and winning it back oh a
nice looking pass oh but just unable to
unlock the
[Applause]
defense Gonzalo
G Pedro
Netto in possession
dama Yan
yordan gives it a go tremendous
[Applause]
block
chanu this might be ideal for the
counter a fine reading of the
situation
[Applause]
Baza can he find the right
pass and fed
[Music]
forwards chanu oh commanding
goalkeeping well they've decided to make
a
change playing it in cluttered

Adama Nathan

imaginative
enough and the referee blows as whistle

prevailed your assessment well
