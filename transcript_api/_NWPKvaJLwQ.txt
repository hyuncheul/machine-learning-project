it is a day of real residence and
significance what an opportunity a
chance to win promotion and they have it
in their own hands win the game and
right new
[Applause]
history drama guaranteed and it's live
coming up next on
eatv
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be enrolling I'm your
match commentator Derek Ray and sitting
alongside me the former Arsenal West Ham
and commentary Midfield player Stuart
Robson and if they play their cards
right today they'll be celebrating
promotion how's it going to go Stuart
well this could be edgy it could be
nervy it could be exciting but what what
we do know if they get a win here today
they will be promoted it's a massive
game for
them
Pon very good
interception
Antonio
[Applause]
rainy possession
lost attending to his defensive
[Applause]
chores
Anthony
Antonio now the attack fizzled
out
wanted to keep it but
couldn't promising
pass
chrisy pretty well
positioned and they'll get ready for the
throw
in
an attack full of Promise well there's
the pullback and the keeper there to
deal with it and a big moment because
the referee is pointed to the spot
penalty coming
up well he's avoided a booking but the
complaints continue and I can understand
why I think it's a poor foul it should
be a yellow card for
me and he finds the net no to because
he's en
counter
so the ball rolling again with the score
line standing at one
[Applause]
n trying to open up the defense well the
fans want to see a
shot opportunity they've only gone and
grabbed another one two goals in quick
succession now they have the lead no
wonder they're
celebrating well here it is again that
was a good finish but the keeper has to
do better at his near post he's beaten
far too easily on that
occasion really nice
ball oh my goodness you've really got to
praise the defending that was
topnotch and Arnold has
it and trusty on the ball
Antonio and quick thinking
[Applause]
defensively nice ball to switch the
point of
attack and taking it
away and Arnold has
it
pressing high up has its
[Applause]
advantages plenty of support here but it
Fizzles out thanks to that piece of
Defending a sloppy
pass and passing it through that is
really alert defending just when the
situation looked
dangerous and trusty on the
ball well they've lost possession of the
ball
minkley The Tackle completely mistimed
and you would expect a booking under the
[Applause]
circumstances now this could be
productive well not a great ball played
[Applause]
in
rainy good looking cross not away
completely
[Applause]
well he's lost
it that's a routine
[Applause]
take inching towards the interval and
it's going with Home Advantage Stewart
as always very keen to get your tick yes
it's been a really energetic display
from them so far the passing's been
sharp the movement from the front
players has been excellent and the
finishing has been clinical they will
certainly be happy going in at
[Applause]
halim timely
intervention good bit of closing down
excellent ball over the top just
straying
[Applause]
offside could be
[Applause]
threatening back with
Ramos and now back with the
keeper Ramos now
and so the first 45 minutes have come
and gone here at the etti
[Applause]
Hat
yes
well they've got things going again here
and I wonder what kind of second half we
have in store for
[Applause]
us really clever
[Applause]
pressing what a magnificent pass can
they get in behind them
pretty well
positioned this might be ideal for the
[Applause]
counter well they have to pay attention
all and all still could be
dangerous threat over for now it
seems beautiful
pass
that's effect of pressure high up the
pitch now he must favor the
cross excellent use of the ball as they
make their way
forward this looks more than decent
[Applause]
good ball to switch the
play they've lost
[Applause]
it
takes it on oh he saved it
[Applause]
well and he's fired over the corner
appear to be in two
minds well they can't quite take
advantage in the end
really showing off as wide range of
passing
skills the supporters think it's on well
the fact of the matter is that was
comfortably off Target well when it
opened up for him that looked to be half
a chance but he got it all wrong didn't
he getting in there to
intercept
minkley
pon
now they have possession in a good area
of the pitch and playing it
through well that looked so promising
but a goal kicked the
[Applause]
outcome beading it
[Applause]
through well as you can see the hosts
have had most of the ball and they've
made good use of it they really have
played some good attacking football and
they look like scoring
more rewarded for that brilliant High
[Applause]
Press the referee spotted the little
Nick on the way through so a throw in
coming up well sloppy in possession
really good build up but no end product
and the referee blows for a
[Applause]
foul play towards the back post pretty
comfortable piece of
Defending and the ball's
gone
Antonio 15 minutes left for
play
Antonio fluency of movement and
defensive play to be
[Applause]
applauded
[Applause]
good tackle taken
away using space on the opposite flank
now the tackle completely Miss time and
you would expect to booking under the
circumstances
[Applause]
well on the cusp of the final whistle
and the homide Really prospering today
Stewart interested to get your take yeah
this has been a good performance they've
looked really sharp going forward and
they've shown a lot of energy they'll
certainly be pleased with their overall
display up to
now now he must favor the cross textbook
defending Inside the
Box realizing that it might be opening
up on the opposite
flank an effective
[Applause]
ball really vital inter
reception plenty of support
here magnificent challenge to win it
back corner kick forth
coming who can they pick out not quite
what they were working on in training
this week oh and it goes now he has his
hattick a special it for
him well here's the replay and it's a
really inviting ball played into the box

forward to this game you can't help but
notice there are some great matchups all
over the pitch particularly in those
Central areas whichever team wins more
of those battles will win the
game
[Applause]
joal oh pressing really
high couldn't keep the
ball options in the
middle oh that's a really good
run and he know know as he must dump it
away and playing it
through good looking driven
ball and it's gone behind for the
corner playing it in not all that
convincing
defensively
[Applause]
a winning back
possession what can they do to stop him
running at
[Applause]
them the well to clear it away
and showing the importance of
wit and credit is due for that good
piece of
Defending thank you they do like to
press whenever they can must take the
lead
here and still danger here well nothing
comes of
it high pressing and good high
pressing
[Applause]
[Applause]
joal well it's all about passing as they
try to hit the front I'll try to take
the time but not enough Care on the
[Applause]
ball great vision to switch the
[Applause]
play and back with Kim and passing it
well well good run this now what can he
do with it in the opinion of the referee
that is a
[Applause]
penalty well no card just a warning and
a fair few protestations well not every
is a yellow card I think the referee is
right
here oh he really bruised the
crossbar time to take the lead Corner
awarded now sending it in insufficient
guile from that corner keeper
ball
[Applause]
well no let up plenty of pressure a
possession lost
intercepted Ramos with
it
joal who can he pick
out
[Applause]
mopping up
defensively
rainy R it superbly to take back
[Applause]
possession incisive
pass
the referee spotted the infringement and
it will be a free kick in a position of
genuine
[Applause]
Menace decent technique but the
goalkeeper did his job a chance to nudge
in front corner kick
[Applause]
here and there's the delivery well no
end
product well let's see about the
[Applause]
cross vital
intervention
really good
challenge element of risk there but he's
won the
ball well the fans are certainly having
their say just listen to them they
thought that was a penalty could be
dangerous FL Rays for
offside Ramos with it
[Applause]
it did look on for them but not to
be and a good looking
[Applause]
ball might still be able to do a better
of damage well thank goodness for the
goalkeeper well they're calm now but
that initial save was absolutely
magnificent that's a very fine piece of
tackling Crossing opportunity
well goal kick just as it was looking
[Applause]
promising oh nice
ball impudent efforts straight forward
for the
[Applause]
keeper
Antonio
antthony and there we have it that
brings to an end the first half here at
the
[Applause]
like
well underway once more and it's going
to be fascinating to see what
developments occur in this second
[Applause]
half and an astute piece of Defending
now maybe room here for the
Counterattack well that's one for them
to
pursue well you've got to give him
credit for that piece of
Defending and they'll get ready for the
throw
in
brth and Kim with it
safe Pair of Hands did his
job and rewarded for that High
[Applause]
Press
chrisy well showing good
vision and teammates around
[Applause]
him oh beating his opponent with ease
[Applause]
Anthony Ramos
now and the keeper has it
now and straight out of play off the
Keeper's boot it will be a Thro
in possession
lost
possibilities Inside the
Box what can he do with it
[Applause]
now but a good piece of Defending to
bring it to an
end
[Applause]
Antonio he has time to play it
over
[Applause]
and there to
intervene now counterattacking
possibilities well nothing comes of it
it looked
promising High pressing at its B
nice weight on the
pass forting him and a goal now they've
broken through one n
here so the match has restarted 1 n
here and Arnold has it and Christy on
the
ball and that's an important
intervention now who can he play it
to
a fine reading of the
[Applause]
situation
Christy moving the ball forward how
creative can they
be and putting pay to the
[Applause]
danger a danger here as he runs at
them and a very good challenge options
in the
center clearing the lines and so it will
be a corner now well it's been a while
but these fans are now coming to life
can they equalize
here delivering
it well it was never really going to be
of concern to the keeper that
one
[Applause]
this could be Troublesome nice looking
move and both hands on it good
[Applause]
goalkeeping just 15 minutes
remaining
promising
pass oh yes what a pass good looking
move couldn't grab hold of it and there
it is an almost intuitive piece of
finishing
joal and back with
Kim bro and he read it superbly
might really be able to trouble them
here but they took care of the situation
[Applause]
defensively
joal well possibilities in the
[Applause]
center that's not a bad
ball well the two sides still locked
together and aist set pie a corner can
make all the
[Applause]
difference now sending it
in still not
clear onto
Cole
bro 5 minutes to
go well the classic example of how to
intercept it is to be a throw
in still pushing for a
winner and credit is due for that good
piece of
Defending
and we will have just one additional
minute and teammates to play it
to really fine piece of Defending play
to break us up and there it is the
full-time whistle well they can't be
separated and goals very much part
of
now
top players on a fitting stage that's
what we're talking about a match of
colossal importance and one that has
captured the imagination of anyone with
an interest in this great game of
football now we're truly ready for what
will be a showdown
[Applause]
and we're with you every step of the way
live coverage here on EA
[Applause]
TV one of the great things about
football is that no one knows for sure
what's going to happen let's see what
unfolds here tonight I'm dck Ray and
sitting next to me with his tactics
charts up the ready is Stuart Robson and
delighted to be bringing you club's
match action Stuart your expectations
yes thanks as always Derek we've got two
good teams here so I'm anticipating a
really good game the atmosphere is
electric inside the stadium before
kickoff and hopefully we're not
disappointed can he make it count what a
commitment to
defending and Arnold has
it and back to the keeper here's
Ramos
well nicely cut
out good technique displayed did well to
clear it
away can they Forge ahead well they
would have done had it not been for the
keeper it's there for him and a goal not
bad for starters they take an early lead
so underway again here one m to
score
maachi and the keeper with the
[Applause]
ball
[Applause]
malinowski try to really get at the
opposition here
and it's played into the
center good piece of
Defending decent looking
[Applause]
[Applause]
pass and options in the
center defensive Brazilians to shut them
down
christe promising
pass now will the cross work out for
them and showing fine
Vision well read to ease the pressure
[Applause]
Romeo
Jaa really good
challenge beautiful
pass opportunity to deliver the
cross I'll tell you what that is really
tough Top Class defending really clever
[Applause]
pressing a glorious chance terrific
block there denied once more and clears
the
danger not a clear foul but the referee
letting the play Flow unable to keep the
ball
Anthony and a chance to LEL it was an
important piece of Defending for Alex
O'Neal Alex O'Neal can you return to
your vehicle yours well it's a decent
looking attack this well it came to
nothing in the
[Applause]
end
that's useful play he got in the way of
that cross fairly easy for the referee
to spot that deflection so now a throw
in oh that's not a good clearance oh
he's through
here ground to make up and perhaps this
corner can assist
[Applause]
them
[Applause]
let's see about the
delivery well just the kind of save
every goalkeeper would expect to
[Applause]
make excellent Vision well it was easy
on the eye but the interception was
made
and he did what he had to do
[Applause]
defensively well halime coming up
shortly and the home side on top Stuart
interested to get your critique well
it's been a tight game so far but
they've just had that little bit more
quality on the ball particularly in
Midfield where they've just started to
take control they'll be fairly happy
going in at halim if it stays like this
[Applause]
alert
defending
Antonio and he could really get at the
opposition chance here well a suspect
piece of finishing when all is said and
done and he'll be thinking about that
for quite some while that's a tame
[Applause]
finish and Arnold has
[Applause]
it oh great
[Applause]
vision well nothing comes of
[Applause]
it and so the halftime whistle is
sounded here in Manchester
[Applause]
so
the cameras are fixed to one man well
he's such a natural finisher he has
everything a good goal scorer needs
composure technique and awareness he
will certainly need to be tightly marked
[Music]
today
live on EA
TV and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be olling I'm Derek
Ray in position to bring you live match
commentary and my expert analyst as
always on these occasions is Stuart
Robson and the stages set for club's
match action Stuart how do you see this
one going thanks Derek well often we
talk about the tactics the individual
players players that are missing but so
often it's the mentality of the players
that is key to winning any football game
which of these teams has the right
attitude today is the big
question and they've escaped without any
damage having been inflicted well he's
made up for his error there that was a
very good
recovery promising pass deserves credit
for the ball
back oh a goal and every player's worst
nightmare because this will go down as
an own
goal well here it is again and quite
clearly that's an own goal he's a bit
unfortunate
really so the match has restarted 1 n
here Ramsey has
it and fed back to to the
goalkeeper can they take
advantage and the flag is up offside
well that's just a lack of awareness he
was clearly in an offside
position
Arnold couldn't keep the
ball Distributing it well and crossed in
the direction of the back
post well it looked highly promising but
they got nothing out of it half-hearted
[Applause]
clearance Crossing
possibilities a deaf
[Applause]
clearance they favored a short one
here and he's taken it away
throw in
given delivering it into the box and
putting pay to the
danger
oh yes what a
pass and that is
offside
mccormac now the pass not finding its
[Applause]
Target well no point in stopping play
Advantage with them
he could pick out a
teammate and flag raised offside well
that was always going to be offside he
just needed to hold on to the ball that
little bit
longer
[Applause]
rainy fine build up as they look to add
to their
advantage superb looking
pass and he's apparently veered into an
offside position Stuart well that's
tight really tight but he was just too
anxious to make his run he was in
[Applause]
though well they're behind but they
might be on to something
[Applause]
here Crossing
opportunity I couldn't quite find just
teammate promising attack this oh
genuine chance and a goal The Equalizer
superb
[Applause]
entertainment so underway again
following the goal that made things
level
[Applause]
Antonio can they exploit the space out
wide and cutting inside well nothing
comes of it it looked
[Applause]
promising
well let's see if something comes of
this what a lovely strike lethal piece
of finishing drilled home with true
conviction tremendous
goal well back underway as we reflect on
the goal that's made it
2-1 in behind for him to
chase there's the cut back
tremendous block and Shing oh it's gone
in and from the tightest of angles the
keeper caught totally off
[Applause]
guard
[Applause]
Lewis is it going to end up being
productive for
them opportunity to deliver the
cross not the best clearance
[Applause]
toy and continues his run but it Fizzles
out thanks to that piece of
[Applause]
Defending
well determination and the challenge a
throw in
here and the danger
[Applause]
cleared determined defending well that
was never likely to trouble the
[Applause]
keeper
well can they be creative from
here and teammates to play it
[Applause]
to can he put them in front look as
though there might be a threat but not
so in the end good defending and there
it is the halftime whistle bringing to
an end the first half here in
Seville
we
so they get the ball rolling in the
second half even Steven here so little
to choose between the
sides
oh nice ball over the top to chase
angles it back and a goal to reestablish
their advantage just look at the
celebrations and Arnold hasing
Antonio credit to them for winning back
[Applause]
possession
[Applause]
toy they're racing away
here and space to cross it comfortable
in dealing with the
cross a very timely
interception real chance he's blocked
it
totty putting all their energies into
winning back
[Applause]
possession now who can he pick
[Applause]
out options in the
middle oh that's fine defensive
play and it crossed the touch line so a
throw in
here
Anthony Arnold and nicely over the top a
really top-notch piece of Defending
a meaty but fair Challenge and it will
be a
throwing a chance to whip it
in just the clearance that was
needed corner kick awarded and let's see
if this will help them add to their
[Applause]
lead breaking at
[Applause]
PACE well didn't go to plan in the
[Applause]
end thumps
clear good through
[Applause]
ball really fine piece of Defending play
to break us
up he could really get at the opposition
well disappointing end to the
move
20 minutes to
go really good strong tackle and it'll
be a throw
in perfectly positioned to take it
away now the Counterattack looks
on nice looking
[Applause]
pass
so a goal kick is what's coming up
[Applause]
here and he takes it
[Applause]
away oh lovely
ball well nothing comes of it in the end
because the flag has gone up Stuart well
he knew where the space was but he's
just been too eager and that's why he's
offside
15 minutes left for
Play Good
movement a fine reading of the
situation and passing it well can he get
them level and the referee doesn't
hesitate that is a spot kick well she's
decided to show The Keeper the yellow
card walking a bit of a tight rope
here and a TI L penalty
save delivering
it last line of defense aware of the
threat solving the
[Applause]
problem well getting close to full time
now and maybe it's not going to happen
for the visitors Stuart well they're
still in with a Chance chance here but
can they produce one more big moment
before the end mind you this has been a
really good
game well still time for them to level
it but really sticking to their task
[Applause]
defensively making sure nothing un to
happened well somehow the goalkeeper got
to it time is not on the side this
corner could help the prospects as they
look for an
equalizer trying to deliver it
accurately good
clearance well that's common sense
refereeing to play
Advantage but he dealt with that ball
played in rather
[Applause]
well really good ball
there
oh he's missed but by a minuscule margin
well he couldn't have made better
contact than that his technique is
brilliant he's so unlucky
there
[Applause]
Lewis we've had the official word there
will be a minimum of two bad Challenge
and now it's up to the referee in terms
of what to do
[Applause]
next chances
on and that will be all for this game
anyway and defeat for the visitors much
to the disappointment of their
supporters well Derek certainly not
their best performance was it just a
little bit off the pace for me and
obviously a disappointing result but the
key thing is they bounce back now and
they can't afford a
[Applause]
repeat
football has the power to enth to
Captivate and this occasion appears
irresistible two magnificent sides
intent upon impressing The Wider world
with a display of Technical and tactical
Brilliance so much riding on
[Applause]
this stay tuned all the action coming up
next
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be enrolling my name
is Derek Ray and sitting next to me here
on the commentary Gant is the former
Arsenal and West Ham United midfield man
Stuart Robson and the Stag is set for
club's match action what do you
anticipate seeing Stuart well Derek we
can talk about coaches and their methods
but it's now down to the players which
ones are going to stand out who will
affect the game and who will have the
greater desire it should be a cracking
game
though well that is how to nullify the
opposition and the referee takes
exception to the Challenge free
kick Martinez on the
ball really being closed
down the verdict is offside
here
and trusty on the
ball
[Applause]
Anthony might be able to produce from
this position delivered into the area
here well not away
[Applause]
properly and a loss of
[Applause]
concentration
man but he's certainly not
alone and that puts them in
position an early goal it is the ideal
opening well here it is again the ball
over the top is an absolute Beauty but I
think the keeper made a mistake here
while it's a decent finish it should go
in at that near
[Applause]
post
Sans decent position for the bloated
ticks to be in and it's offside that was
very
[Applause]
close Christie nicely timed tackle
that's a good looking
ball this could level it oh he's missed
it he'll be kicking himself well the
opportunity presented itself and they
really should be level they have to be
more composed more clinical if they want
to get back into
[Applause]
this here's
Ramos he's got
space not too fussy in clearing his
lines and take it
away and Tristy on the ball on the
offensive it has to
[Applause]
be the really single-minded piece of
Defending to make sure nothing unto
happened decision was lacking throw in
coming
[Applause]
up
Antonio oh that's a fine
pass making a bit of Headway laid into
the center well the danger is still
there being egged On by The Crowd Oh
that's a super piece of the
defending and the ticks exploiting the
space out wide and played in with haste
well he wasn't messing around with the
clearance so the blowed tick maybe with
an opportunity to equalize
[Applause]
here Crossing
possibilities
not Advantage with them referee says
play
on
Sans not forcing the issue great
composure but then the one that goes
astray
and the danger
[Applause]
cleared superb looking
pass has eyes for goal oh such an
elegant finish how about that on the
volley a brilliant strike whatever way
you look at it chrisy
[Applause]
and Arnold has
it and the ball in behind the
Defenders now he must favor the
cross that is a very fine challenge in
difficult
circumstances
promising
[Applause]
pass and threading it
through spectacular save Top Class
goalkeeping danger averted for now but
they have a corner to defend and
deciding to go short with this one
that's a useful cross well off tar is in
the end and that'll be a goal kick well
I think the defender just about did
enough there but that was a
chance she has teammates around
her really vital interception
[Applause]
here
Sans
gun and just one minute of time added on
for stoppages
oh great
vision and defensive play to be
applauded halime that will do it for the
first half here at the etti
[Applause]
had
down
the
so back underway here into the second
half good
[Applause]
tackle and Arnold has
[Applause]
it
showing a real will to win the
ball dangerous
ball did well to push it past their
opponent mopping up
[Applause]
[Applause]
defensively with the game level let's
see what they can do with this this
corner they favored a short one here and
the cross not quite imaginative
enough interception to Snuff out the
danger safe PA ofans did his
[Applause]
job
[Applause]
Antonio the ticks recovering possession
well can they do something positive on
the coun
attack oh the flag's gone up and there
wasn't much in
[Applause]
that and options in the
center really fine piece of Defending
play to break us
up the tick finding space on the
[Applause]
flank well that's gone out and it is
going to be a goal
kick Ramos with
it so a half an hour
[Applause]
remaining
Antonio you can sense the threaters
there disappointing
[Applause]
pass
[Applause]
now counterattacking possibilities
here well disappointing end to the
move took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
[Applause]
them rainy
and Christy on the
ball
Antonio oh nice
ball it's looking
promising oh great
block
man options in the center oh danger here
oh big opportunity oh my goodness he's
caught that so well a goal of the
highest class fantastic
[Applause]
technique well possession
seated good run very much in control of
the situation opportunity here well what
a stop it was well I have to say that's
a magnificent save that's a top class
piece of
goalkeeping who can they pick
out and he did what he had to do
defensively and the conditions look
pretty good for the
Counterattack they could level it have
to pay attention defensively and a goal
to square the game head to the seat
St well another equalizer what a topsy
tury game this has
[Applause]
been
Sans bong and the bloated ticks in a
position of potential
[Applause]
Menace
man well that ball looks promising great
vision to switch the
play and a simple clearance a good
one so much Focus within the team and
completely focused on winning the game
now he'll be delighted to have won the
ball having made that difficult
[Applause]
Challenge and Tristy on the
ball getting forward
[Applause]
could cross it in
here now who can he pick
out it was on it way in well this corner
could be pivotal it might represent the
last chance to get in front in the dying
moments now sending it in danger revers
it for now
and we've entered the final 5
minutes and the referee sees that as a
