I
a crucial day stands in front of them
the knowledge that a win is required to
make it through to the promotion match
and no doubt about it their opponents
won't be of a mind to do them any favors
at
[Applause]
all it's coming up on EA
TV
good evening and welcome ahead of what
should be a pulsating night of football
my name is Derek Ray and sitting next to
me here on the commentary Gantry is the
former Arsenal and West Ham United
midfield man Stuart Robson and if all
goes to plan they can progress to a
promotion match what might we see today
steuart well Derek I think this will be
tense but they know a good performance
and a victory will give them access to a
promotion match it should be an
interesting game
and defensive play to be
applauded oh great attacking
play so a throw in
here from long range and a relatively
simple say for
[Applause]
her well possession
seated
a good Vision
there Reed
now and the ruling is offside
[Applause]
here
Hill
this looks interesting and clears his
lines well read to put an end to that
attack well part of the story today
hitting a milestone in terms of
appearances well Derek 50 games for this
club now it shows how consistent this
player has been such a key player in
this
team and position but pressure to cope
with an almost instinctive clearance and
a corner
now play over sound piece of
Defending might take the
lead and there it is the opening goal
One n and they'll feel they deserve
it well as you can see he's just placed
that Beyond The Keeper that's a very
good finish so the match has restarted 1
n
[Applause]
here
Reed promising pass well no problems
defensively good Vision can he get onto
this
well high quality defending well the
keeper had to intervene under a bit of
pressure
there making sure nothing came of
it that's useful
play
Reed
[Applause]
now this could Square the game well
somehow the goalkeeper got to
[Applause]
it
[Applause]
now sending is in no shortage of
excitement level again no wonder they're
[Applause]
excited well here it is again it's a
good delivery from the corner and it's a
comfortable finish in the end which is
made to look so easy it's a lovely
[Applause]
goal
[Applause]
def United might be able to cash in a
fine
block oh that's really
untidy oh genuine chance able to clear
the danger at least for
[Applause]
now favoring the short
one wasteful from
United he continues his
run might work
out
magnificent challenge to win it
back and nicely over the top and that's
really well
[Applause]
[Music]
read
that's how to dispossess your
[Applause]
opponent Campbell with
it possession Changing
[Applause]
Hands
[Applause]
Reed and the challenge holds them in
their tracks
encouraging stuff from
United and the flag has gone up well he
has to work a lot harder to stay on side
there he didn't read the situation at
[Applause]
all and giving it
away the cross is
on
well credit for that piece of ball
winning now what can she do next
defensive roadblock in the way of that
cross clear to see who got the last
touch so a throw in it'll
be referee whistle then halime here at
the estadi o Jose
[Applause]
Soria
[Applause]
[Applause]
h
well they've got things going again here
and I wonder what kind of second half we
have in store for
[Applause]
us United could get in behind the
defense plays it
back
United Come Away with
[Applause]
it and it took a little Nick before it
went over the touch line so a throw in
here and the pass defly cut
[Applause]
out
Reed her up
decent looking
pass still on level terms moving the
ball nicely well clattered
[Applause]
away just the challenge that was
required it's a fine United move in the
making but they took care of the
situation defensively
B beautifully weighted
ball and a goal it is the keeper really
not part of the
equation well two one it is
here well nothing productive
really
Hill Crossing
opportunity insufficient guile on the
crossing front you've got to
say and we have 30 minutes to
go but he could really get at the
opposition still could be dangerous
well that clearance the lowrisk approach
a throw in coming up now well they no
longer have the
ball
re herel oh lovely
ball some of the fans are screaming have
a
go perfect
tackle
now who can she pick
out oh great
vision and there's a quality defender in
action well that's really strong play to
keep hold of the
ball
[Applause]
Hill and into the last 20
minutes
Maurice strong but fair
tackle chance to finish and a goal
that's his brace they just can't keep
him
quiet well it's a tale of four goals in
this match now three 31 it
[Applause]
is he could pick out a
teammate not high quality
[Applause]
defending
Jong did look as though they might be on
to something for a second or
so
[Applause]
Hill well showing everyone her abilities
in possession well didn't go as a plan
on the
end
Campbell you saw the situation
developing
Now options are
plenty must be goalkeeper getting in the
way superb
[Applause]
save it's a short
Corner well he's given it
away
Cavani and he's alone in the middle but
a look at things
and a decent save for
credit and over it comes well In
fairness it wasn't the best of
[Applause]
headers and United couldn't keep
possession
could P one back here which he does and
maybe just maybe there's enough time for
an equalizer it would be quite the
fanatic
turnaround underway again and we're
being treated to plenty of goals 3-2 at
the
moment Reed what can they do from here
well that's common sense refereeing to
play advantage
that's a good this could finish
it and in all likelihood that is game
over so little time left for a
response and stuffing out the
danger and one minute of stoppage time
has been added
[Applause]
on really clever pressing
thing oh could
be oh a vital piece of last ditch
defending the referee blows for full
time it ends at a victory for the home
team no complaints from the fans here
well Derek it was a comfortable win in
the end fully deserved their Victory
because they dominated every aspect of
the game it was a really good result for
them here
today
[Applause]
[Applause]
yeah
it's
from here on in everything possesses an
extra Edge that extra bit of pressure
and the players know they've got to
deliver it's the first promotion match
so much on the line and we can't wait
for the
excitement
live on
eatv good evening and welcome ahead of
what should be a pulsating night of
football I'm Derek Ray in the commentary
position and I'm joined for expert
analysis by my partner Stuart Robson and
how will they fair in this their first
test of a promotion match in the
division Stuart what are you expecting
well this is a big game for them yes
they've done well up to this point but
this will be tough today they need to
play well
[Applause]
here good waight on that
pass teammate and
support sound piece of
defending the attack continues they're
making considerable
progress but a good piece of Defending
to bring it to an
end oh nice ball over the
top well you can probably see why we're
focusing on this fellow as one to watch
Stewart in particular what do you expect
to see from him well Derek his
outstanding attribute is his Pace not
just over the first few yards but over
longer distances as well and that makes
him so difficult to play against
Defenders are un to get tight or drop
off a dynamic
player Oh beating his opponent with
ease a real struggle to contain
him trying to open them
up the fans are shouting
shoot just wanted to get it out of of
[Applause]
there very alert defending to put a stop
to the
[Applause]
chance and the danger
cleared now who can she play it to
and play halted free kick
[Applause]
given that's a useful cross and there it
is the opening goal 1 n and they'll feel
they deserve it
[Applause]
well the ball is moving once more how
important will that opening goal prove
to be good
[Applause]
distribution greal is it going to be oh
there it is a back and four S of match
now they're level again the lead lasted
merely minutes
not a pass that lacks
quality could cross it in
here oh great attacking play the game
has been turned on its head they have
never stopped believing and now they
sense victory
well underway again it's a narrow 2-1
lead as things
stand
Cavani and showing fine vision and the
flag has gone up here offside the
[Applause]
decision
P well keeping hold of the ball is what
it's all about for them giving it a real
go in the wide
[Applause]
area opportunity maybe can they stop it
going in well thumped
[Applause]
clear that's a nice looking ball another
successful intervention winning the ball
back Reed
[Applause]
now
[Applause]
well let's see about the cross will it
[Applause]
be led that pass all the way cutting it
out well they've given him too much
space oh nice ball and he's clear as
lines won't complain about having won
the corner and maybe an opportunity to
increase their
[Applause]
advantage play over they've gone it
scored again they're doing everything in
the power to make sure they're not
pegged
back
[Applause]
Tong well we're almost at the halfway
stage and they're not making Home
Advantage work for them one little bit
here Stuart your assessment I have to
say Derek they haven't played well
they've been slow in possession they've
been poured defensively and they've
lacked a Cutting Edge they need to
perform much better than
this
re perfect
tackle
how about the cross oh opportunity oh
such a high class volley off the charts
in terms of quality and that's one she's
not going to forget in a hurry well here
it is again and it's all about the paac
in transition they're so quick to get
out from the back and the movement is
good making for a comfortable finish
it's a really great
goal and the ball is moving again
3-2 promising
[Applause]
pass plenty of support here determined
[Applause]
defending playing it in well they
couldn't take advantage of the
chance another
corner
[Applause]
struggling to get it
away and gobbled up with ease by The
Keeper try to open them
up and the electronic board showing one
additional
minute now who can she pick
out
well nothing productive
[Applause]
really well there it is the halim
whistle is sounded we're at the Midway
Point here at
[Applause]
the
[Applause]
okay
well runs away once more and it's going
to be fascinating to see what
developments occur in this second
[Applause]
half Özil oh lovely weighted ball they
might be
in
Distributing it well deep delivery a
very effective
[Applause]
clearance I must say this looks
promising who can he pick out a fine
block
and the ball's
[Applause]
gone Campbell with
[Applause]
it Cavani
and the challenge HTS them in their
[Applause]
tracks well let's see about the cross
well it still could be dangerous
[Applause]
that is a very fine challenge in
difficult
[Applause]
circumstances and played the pass
well and a chance to whip it in
here is it going to be vigorous
[Applause]
defending that's a nice looking ball
still work to do well it's offside and
maybe his game awareness deserted him
well it was really good play out wide
but it counts for nothing because as you
said Derek he showed a lack of awareness
there cross it in here good challenge
and a throw Inc coming
[Applause]
up it will be a go kick
[Applause]
here a cross lacking guile and accuracy
got to it easily the
[Music]
keeper
[Applause]
Reed now Top Class
defending well can they be creative from
here it's got to me look like a certain
goal but that's a great
challenge now the Counterattack looks
on Cross could be useful and you need
your Defender to take
charge
Modric plenty of Running Room in the
wide position but they took care of the
situation
defensively
heril that's a good
ball Crossing
opportunity and a throw in it's going to
be well the visitors as you can see
haven't enjoyed the majority of
possession but their counterattacking
has been really good particularly in the
wide areas it's been an excellent
performance from them so far well that's
right preserving the lead and doing it
really well well it looked highly
promising but they got nothing out of
it in a position from which they could
potentially do a bit of damage here but
quit thinking
defensively a lot of space to
attack and defensive play to be
applauded could be a chance to break
here well still pushing forward it's a
matter of whether or not they can come
up with an equalizer and he did what he
had to do
[Applause]
defensively cbell on the
ball
GRE now what can they do from
here he's blocked
it far from a smooth challenge now will
the referee produce a
[Applause]
card
Bridge
Modric on attacking
possibilities Crossing into the middle
well it might still work out for
them well that's a sad end to the
attack well the fans are certainly
playing their part here just listen to
this
noise
and the fourth official confirming that
we'll have one additional minute oh and
a perfect ball now how about
[Applause]
this and that is the end of the game it
goes into the history books as a home
defeat well Derek it was a hardfought
contest which neither side completely
dominated but the result will certainly
hurt them they need to bounce back next
time
out
[Applause]
