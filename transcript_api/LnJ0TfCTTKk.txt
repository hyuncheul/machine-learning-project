all right everybody welcome back to
another video today we are playing some
Lux in the mid lane warning Harvest
cheap shot eyeball ultimate absolute
focus and Gathering storm we're going to
try and get some one shot lasers I might
do uh Shadow flame first item since it's
so busted I don't think storm surge is a
rush anymore with the Nerfs but I might
go at second item but I think if I have
shadowflame storm surge this is my first
two items one combo should be one
kill we just have to be careful about
our Mana but I did take
teleport so I can get that back pretty
easy if anything we'll build a
tier or the item that gives the all
taste against tiia not too bad of a
matchup
actually we don't have a dash and we
don't get close enough to really get hit
by her knockup too easy
without at least being able to hit her
back if I go for an auto she can trade
but my e outranges
her I'll just play the lane nice and
slow for
now cuz I don't have Mana flow good luck
Smiley
thanks but what we've noticed this
season is a lot of Champions don't
actually need a Mana item because
there's just so much damage in the game
you just kill somebody instead of
needing enough Mana to cast again she
warded up
here I'm getting a gank I
re okay ja might have made an
oopsie but tilla's kind of stuck she's
going to have to flash the wall oh good
Juke
the only thing is like where was she
going she need to flash over the
wall goodbye Cannon none may destroy
Oblivion she's getting TP back though
she doesn't lose too
much I feel like she could have got out
if she went to the wall and Flash unless
she already flashed
away I'm really bad at noticing flashes
though leaves much room for
reflection but that is a good start
early snowballing you know we should
probably pick up a dark seal too I'm
just not even going to put a point in my
shield for now I don't need it I want
damage got a
harvest um okay yeah see she did didn't
flash I'm not crazy
okay an ally has been slain my
minion an enemy
SL such beautiful complexity in the
light not
terrible I mean by putting no points in
my shield I won't use the spell and
won't waste 60 Mana who cares if I die
right we are a literal Cannon made out
of
glass lots of damage but break at the
slightest
touch see Bild
this we don't want to Ward but I know
she's in like this this general area and
I'm probably going to base soon so I
don't really want to waste
it I see both bot laners and nami's
probably not going to roam the thing is
if I just chill till level six I think
my combo at level six might have enough
damage to kill her but I probably should
go by
first
silence so maybe we'll shove this next
wave the thing is if I go base she might
go base she definitely might go base
now but I think I have enough damage to
kill her without buying now since I hit
that I get the wave
pushing yeah if she gets hit by Q she's
going although look at my Mana I only
have enough Mana for two
spells 90 that's 200 Mana right there
for those two spells so I could maybe q
and then all that might do enough since
Harvest is
up now I could get
ganked just going to walk at her see
what happens if she casts her W it makes
her stand still for like half a second
and she could get hit by the
Q There It
Is Well just barely not
enough vvth got the grublets she's going
to be coming from top side
still uh we'll just base tiia can all
back toan if I overstay look at that
2300 I mean I can rock storm surge on
its own 110
5% I feel like this might actually be
better I'm I'm not even getting Mobility
I don't
care see I have to TP here cuz I really
if I TP I'm only going to like miss one
less Minion or something cuz she's going
to push this
way
uhoh see I only missed one minion so TP
here is not really needed the tp's here
just in case I run out of Mana or I get
ganked and die and I need to get back
really fast
but I have uh a lot of damage right now
I'm guessing if I hit everything in a
combo I do about 80% of her HP so let's
hit her with okay wow one e already did
30% of her HP but that's cuz of
alternator add extra 75
76 so alternator's down for a
while I'd like it to be up in our full
combo uh B could be on dragon that would
be a nice one to
have can't really go check alone though
oh wow my E's already one shotting the
my E's already one shotting the
casters on my first
base yeah she's definitely on this let's
see if we can do something about it
uh that
sucks G used dishy Dash as soon as I
use I'll take it me get some more I got
blue buff and you know what we don't
necessarily need a Mana item because
once we get later in the game there's
just so many free blue Buffs all
over all right please one shot the
casters please oh it does that is
actually
busted this might be the
move
I do have like no CDR besides what I'm
getting from Blue buff but I can kill
her in 7 Seconds when my Al's
up an ally has been
slain well I could Al the wave to shove
it pretty hard but don't really need to
cuz this next e is going to clear this
whole
wave I mean why not she just tpd back to
Lane and she already has to base
again so all I have to do is worry about
belth here and hard shove this next
wave
I mean what benefit am I getting from
putting no points in Shield I'm getting
like one extra point in ER or Q right a
little bit earlier look at I
CS my auto so here I could uh TP back I
could miss some Minions on this
wave okay we have a shadow flame boots
seal get a mo but I don't know if I'm
getting anything with haste we'll
TP okay she got some magic resist she
might go mercs in me I don't even lose a
minion Manana doesn't seem too bad I
mean I did have a blue
buff got to remember she does have some
Mr
now is probably
dead
will and she did go to the
sky
rage she must have used all her dashes
to clear the GRS cuz she should have
been easily able to avoid that an En see
if I even leveled up my shield I
wouldn't have used it for anything I
didn't really take any damage yet
so it's a
waste I need a blue
buff
down 116 farm at 11 minutes I think I
have almost perfect Farm I probably
missed like five minions
total I mean I could get Sor shoes or
another alternator I'll probably just
get the shoes in a book can I get a book
yeah
I'm huge like I am very very
fed the r of the darkar H I'm going to
lose some minions here unless I
ult it's not worth it
though use my alt and get a kill I only
used the three
melees yeah she's roaming
again maybe she's going to roam I am
going to this wave it either brings her
back or she loses another plating at the
cost of ganking trundle we see belth up
there
too yeah JX is here so she's going to
have to be walked down with belth she's
going long
route unless she's in the bush up here I
the inability
of I'll just clear the back casters
they're a little bit harder to
reach oh my God I
misclicked I have to be very careful how
many spells I use on the wave because I
really don't have that much
Mana I don't have a ward for over the
wall I mean it might just be the play to
go for this first turret since it's
almost
dead I could e then Al but mf's coming
up so I think they're doing
Dragon dude I clear the whole wave in
like one
e
almost they're not on it but I think
they're in here each new star ignited
helps bind the Shadows I could be on a
ward but I'm standing far enough away
where I shouldn't
anything uh
kind of had to panic flash but it's a
good thing I did Flash I mean they're
they're pretty chunk they shouldn't be
able to do anything
here destroyed if I did hit anything
else besides the
alt probably could have taken one with
me I don't have enough Mana got to
base I mean we're only a few minutes
away from Blue Buffs and our blue Buffs
up when does the jungler share dark
matter find the universe together but we
of the Court shepher the Light
Between can't sell my potions for
anything she's just hard shoving tp's up
in
10 it'll kill one of these and focus
Cannon and I should get
them such beautiful complexity in the
light oh just barely too slow I was
detonating it when I I could but it
just what are you
doing
wow I wasn't even going for Teo I still
don't have a point in
W the silver Lux Mains are in
shambles please do argue with me that
I'm wrong for putting no points in it
let's compare our scores shall
we an I just one shot was Teo full I
just like one shot
him I have storm surge don't I at
200 I mean I'm just going to do my thing
I'm going to sit mid I don't want to
roam if I roam I lose CS I'm up a solid
55 Cs on
TOA fruits here for
you uh she dashed out of my thing the
fruits like
this not bad ARA's going to have a
shield
too
dare we are going to have a lot of magic
damage on the team since we have a brand
two but we have trundle Jax and kaisa so
we should
be up team you ready to get one shot
again you're
welcome face toward
enemy I don't need to waste Herald on
this but if teemo's going to keep
shrooming it it will take a
while oh they're Lane
swamping I don't have flash up I'm worth
1,000 gold Bounty
so it's not worth it for me to die to
get a kills
conell going
migma he has shrooms around this area
I'm just going to use my empowered
recall get out of here I think it might
actually be best if I go death capap
next it's either death capap Magi I'm
not really getting enough stacks on dark
seal yet I'm just going to go death
capap next in one shot theind creation
the all inspiring new Stars this is why
I must
Prevail 189 18 minutes holy
cow well hey look I got my shield for
when it actually
matters I'm going to keep my health at
full none may destroy Oblivion only
resist its endless
call well oh teo's in the room
oh my god
dude that laser did so much damage I saw
he was going to get stunned by J so it
would
be it would be a guarantee all oh it's
fine I get a turret
teesty stupid
shroom I mean I could crash Herold into
this next turret should we just go bot
and use it down there of
wait can't I ride it but wait watch this
I'm probably going to end but I don't
give a
[ __ ] no no oh God oh God oh God oh God
oh God oh
God drift boom oh
[ __ ] I mean it worked I don't know how
you crash it into the
turret it's well I hit the minions oh my
God storm
surge I thought I crashed it into a
turret if you drive it like that if feel
like hit a dead on or something I have
TP one e kills
MF darn I was trying to catch MF if
she'd like turn
around I'm reset really quick I'm out of
Mana
Ally
has
uhoh I killed her with Q I literally
only hit her with
Q I give big Shield too just
unfortunately flashed out of
it I'm going to wait for my Q so don't
flash out of my
r
did I hit
it dude I it made no indication that I
hit that I knew I hit it it's just like
I had no sound cue or anything so like I
didn't think it
hit
damn that's the thing that sucks about
not having a ludin so your team has
destroyed a tret like I knew the angle
was perfect it just I didn't hear any
noise so I thought I
missed till I got visual of the
target we almost have the death cap I
have 500 AP at 21
minutes I don't know if it's a bug does
Lux I don't think Lux Cube makes noise
if you don't have a loot for First
Strike I don't think it makes noise if
you hit it so I should have just like
YOLO sent my whole combo and believed
myself the whole team get these now yeah
right uh we just need to be a little
careful
on the baron
area Al has been
SL
shim sorry bud oh my God that was 1,400
extra damage than he needed to
take F right
okay I don't know why she went so deep
she like didn't even do any damage to
me G flash stunned me too flash
knockup yeah see we chilling as long as
I just have blue
buff if I don't have blue buff I just
got to be a little slow with my spells
but I mean I don't have any haste to
really waste it
anyway
go I have a death cap but I also have TP
in a minute and I mean even without this
death cap if I just hit a
q i just kill anybody even if I don't
hit the que I just have to hit
something and you're stopping my Canon
all right death cap time I mean how much
does mag cause I just need a little bit
more actually one more wave I get ma
death cap into
GG uh B
has has
mercs if I auto I can kill
her uh I'll get out of there who's up
top that can kill me I might run into
Teemo please don't be a shroom
here I really thought they were going to
cut me off here and I was going to have
to use my combo
again
he's
dead storm
surge just fine I got to spend my money
man I think we have to go void blast
they're going to get
MRN oh well maintaining almost perfect
Farm I mean the the longer the game goes
as long as I'm not farming like side
lanes and jungle it's like near
impossible to keep good Farm because it
really doesn't matter as much
anymore the court still stands that is
all
matter not even going to eat she's dead
the storm
surge it really doesn't even do that
much damage but it's nice for when they
have one
HP
oh stand by
creation well I was like a wee bit
off oh I predicted where'd she
go oh I hit him oh wait does he have a
storm surge too I guess my storm surge
didn't kill him but the brandburn did
afterwards I give pretty massive Shields
too cuz I have so much AP 811 AP at 26
minutes
Celestial and there it is
GG there's just nothing they could do
they couldn't kill
me not b bad at all I think I'm going to
add an Aram onto this so stay tuned if
you want to see me play some aam we got
some FF games today
[Music]
unfortunately but they they really
couldn't do anything to me there's no
way they could pick me I don't think it
ever was even
close see my
damage
promoted look at that damage 25k damage
and 26 26 minutes we out damage a
Teemo Rune stance onto the
Aram okay for the Aram we got Ezreal I
think I'm going to do lethality Ezreal
cuz they're pretty squishy I want to do
AP Ezreal I mean how much AP we only
have Morana as AP I did take conquer
though so I'm probably just going to go
lethality the problem with ap is it just
takes too long to like come
online a mighty weapon call me a hero
after do like manamune
into I don't
know the what's it called pycho sword
might not be too bad maybe hubris though
Hubris in Aram seems kind of busted
unless it's
Nerf not sure if hubis is balanced for
this mode
yet oh I didn't hit the e
there's what the hell Mor there's no
lethality Sheen
item I might still have to get a
Triforce we's see or
Essence
I
imag oh I got the kill let's
go else I need a lot of haste cuz I
stack up conquer I get so much damage
from
that I don't think PTA is that good in a
there's too many targets to get in the
way sorry
sorry
ah and we got some really questionable
clashes on this
a well I'm stacked up
but I do need to buy
soon got him I didn't hit brand at
all okay what's better all cool down
boots 15
only
ah this is probably better the more ad
the
better
enemy so his W scale is better with a
now so lethality I mean it does magic
damage so lethality doesn't really help
it but I'm going to have a lot of AD
lethality helps my
C my
Autos get away from me oh thanks lukon
appreciate
it I could Al them but they're not low
enough you kill the
maiden oh that's a good hit didn't net
me a kill this Lucian is just
like kind of going until he dies I
see how did by heal
reduction
imaculate she got a full item
already
what I get stunned
by
fa oh we have axan though they have Sona
but we have axan we get
revived well I'm getting a a lot of
kills
and I'm getting a
l I'm
done I'm getting a lot of farm too maybe
I should go this
first I mean how is it stacking up for
her yet she hasn't got the
kill okay time to dust I mean we'll get
the hubris it gives 15
watching
enemy okay so yeah I think this item
might be a little broken on this mode
it's going to give me one ad for every
kill or
[Music]
assist
it seems like it might last a little bit
less than normal on AR maybe
not
the yor ghou is getting away
watch I think I got
him barrier saves me once
again all right uh oh this is just about
stacked up I need to finish
that we can get cool down boots too I
rather have that over a long
sword thought I'd end up in
pieces an ally okay we got to get a kill
so I get my extra
ad my Q's already doing so much damage
oop oh we're already at bonus 33 ad
uh that's going to be fair towards the
end of this
game oh I got
him
well this is a
stop oh that hits the turret
oops I just did like 80% of York's
Health just by queuing and
out here but I really not
dead one of them was going to like flash
kill me or
that more damage all right
ooh maybe we get the
Hydra Hydra
Grudge I mean I don't necessarely need a
Shen item what is what do Essence
do
Prett
good
en
not you have SL an
enemy 41
ad 43 wait I get two every
time he dodged it a
lot
team if I can land Q's my w has really
low cool
down I guess we don't need a Sheen
item
got I flash up that
point more
lethality
an enemy
has an enemy has
been I want to try
this my life for my team that's what it
there's only 11 minutes in I have 18
kills an enemy
this Hydra does so much damage to
enemies that are below
50%
51 the Hydra does work on my as it
should
could it be a
p
you don't deny me the
penta got
it how much ad was my hoop set after
that I think we just go
this I don't need the cyclo sword when I
can slow on every Q at this thing
an enemy has been
slain an ally has been
slain okay time to dust
Andy let end this one
out
the sorcer is my fault ion let which
does my w do only
355 my Q probably does like 500
700

alive
I wanted a q that would have done over a
thousand 26
kills okay my huis was adding over 100
my hubis and Conquer were adding over
100 damage to my
Q
I want this really bad oh I could Al
down mid maybe get a minion or an assist
or
something
nice oh he's a not going to get
him but I got my item okay now I just
