a huge match in the race for the title
90 minutes that could be absolutely make
a break for their respective aspirations
stay tuned we'll have all the action for
you live from London here on EA
TV we're at the home of Arsenal here in
North London and everything points
through an exciting contest I'm Derek
Ray and joining me to provide expert
analysis is Stuart
Robson
and very much looking forward to
bringing you action from the Premier
League it's AR up against the dream
destroyers yes thanks as always Derek
we've got two good teams here so I'm
anticipating a really good game the
atmosphere is electric inside the
stadium before kickoff and hopefully
we're not
disappointed Gabriel
Jesus
Rice onto
jinho and teammates to play it to and
Beyond the last Defender offside
and a look at the starting lineup for
Arsenal Thomas parte starts alongside
Dean rice in central Midfield and
leading the line today is Gabrielle
[Applause]
Jesus
pedri
Ronaldo working away patiently looking
for an
opening trying to find the right angle
of attack determined defending seemed to
switch off for a moment and now a throw
in and introducing the visitors lineup
today well it'll be interesting to see
how the Wingers play today will they
stay high and wide will they come INF
field and support the center forward and
how deep will they come out of
possession they're going to be key to
this
formation well recognition for the
manager earlier nobody can say he
doesn't deserve the manager of the month
award they're in the sort of position
they'd want to be at this stage yeah
they've had a great start to the SE oh
Stewart they've got to score still a
chance well it came to nothing in the
end
Jamal incisive pass and a goal an early
boost for them the first goal of the
game they're off and
running well let's see this again this
is counterattacking football at its very
best and then the shot could not be hit
any better struck with such ven him
great
goal
[Applause]
well he knows that could prove to be a
massive goal just look at his
reaction so the game restarted by
Arsenal a wake up call for the Arsenal
players perhaps can they construct a
response well there's no getting away
from it this is the man so many people
have been focusing on ahead of this
particular game not named in the
starting 11 he has to be content with a
place on the bench Stewart what do you
make of the situation well it's a big
call by the manager and I'm interested
to know why he's left him out is he just
rested him or is he unhappy with his
recent
displays the attack carried an initial
threat but fizzled
out buai
oaka
[Applause]
jinho
Marcelli on tote shot blocked but still
alive it is now with jinho oh he saved
it
[Applause]
[Applause]
well
and over it comes and look at that a
goal here for Arsenal who now have got
themselves on
terms well here it is again it's a Well
delivered ball into the box and then
what a great finish as well good
connection with the ball leaving the
keeper with little chance it's a great
goal so back underway following The
Equalizer Thomas
[Applause]
party good vision from Gabrielle
Jesus in position to give them the lead
maybe oh dealt with and turned onto the
woodwork and they will be awarded a free
kick for
[Applause]
that it is now with zinho opportunity
here and the Keeper's technical skills
there for all to see well from that
close in that's a really good safe such
good
reflexes
he's driven in the corner needs to clear
it and the attack fizzling
out it is now with zinho well he hit it
with Authority
close well Arsenal getting frustrated
now just look at the number of chances
they've made but you do sense a goal is
coming
here
Martin
[Applause]
erard well we can give them high marks
for their passing but can they make this
pressure count well they might be able
to launch a
Counterattack well not to be in terms of
the
Counterattack Ronaldo
and a chance for the lead and there is
the goal to reestablish their
advantage well I think that shows what a
good rapport he has with the
players well here it is again and it's
really poor defending they just don't
show enough urgency to get tight or make
a block which is why the balls ended up
in the back of their
net
well he can't control his Delight can he
it's a wonderful moment for his
team so there we have it
21 I'm hearing there's been a goal at
the London Stadium that means we join
Alex Scott yeah it's a goal for Spurs it
was a low driven cross into a crowded
area but he was there from close range
to finish that move off they've Squad
the opener here with 35 minutes
many thanks as ever
Alex it is now with
jinho and giving the ball
away and still looking for space plays
it
back meny opportunity to level
it still a chance and he squandered the
chance to equalize well I have to say
that's a wasted opportunity they should
be level
here
parte and return to
Jesus Splendid defending and it needed
to
be
now who can he play it to parte this
could Square the
game oh tremendous block and the
referee's verdict is penalty
[Applause]
kick and now to level the
game and the keeper denies them from the
spot well just listen to the fans they
know this is a big chance
[Applause]
here and he's fired over the corner No
Nonsense be
defending stopped to Sure Fire
goal and space to cross
it meni now with
pte angles it back and able to close
down the
shot and the Counterattack is on options
available Neymar can't miss surely
and he's kept it out fully stretched
somehow reaching
it well he knows that would have won the
game so frustrating for
[Applause]
him let's see about the delivery not the
most confident
clearance
Ronaldo strong play
here well they kept their Shake
defensively job done for now and time is
up as far as the first half is concerned
here at the
Emirates
and the match
begins so the ball rolling again
destroyers in
h
front but no room for
[Applause]
complacency
and
[Music]
Neymar well no way
through tan rice breaking at
PACE
Ronaldo nicely timed tackle
[Applause]
Martinelli dangerous looking through
ball Gabrielle Jesus and a decent save
for
credit well Arsenal are playing well and
creating chances just look at those
stats but it counts for nothing unless
they are more clinical with their
finishing have the ball again what can
they do with
it and tidy defensive
play and the referee has awarded the
free kick he tried to play Advantage but
it wasn't
forthcoming and they will make the
change
[Applause]
now
[Applause]
well they get themselves level here full
credit wonderful
[Applause]
stop
and we very much hope you'll join us for
more live Premier League action on eatv
it's Arsenal taking on
Brighton
Ronaldo can they hit on the
[Applause]
break belli can they use it to their
advantage chances on
it could be up for
grabs and the danger is
averted Cristiano
[Applause]
Ronaldo good
idea well opportunity to extend their
advantage squandered well what a chance
that is he should have scored
there plenty of supports
here
Ronaldo can he take advantage well not
the easiest of saves but you'd expect
him to stop it and they'll get ready for
the throw in
[Applause]
well no shortage of live action coming
your way right here on eatv and Stuart
and I looking forward to being with you
for this match I'm really looking
forward to that two entertaining teams
in what should be a really feisty
Affair and passing it through and the
flag raised offside it is
well they have elected to go to the
bench at this stage of the
[Applause]
game and the dream destroyers pushing
the ball forward with options available
cross into the penalty area was it a
great
clearance takes the shot stopped a
certain
goal well with the support of these fans
Arsenal are throwing everything at this
now what a finish we're going to get to
this
game and nothing comes of that
attack
good through
ball making progress and the Keeper's
technical skills there for all to see
well from that close in that's a really
good save such good
reflexes and time for the change
now he's driven in the corner the
clearance wasn't
decisive
Salah
Cox chance to play it
in
Salah now with
[Applause]
Ronaldo Gabrielle
Martinelli racing forward trying to
catch them
out well it broke down
[Applause]
alas
10 minutes to go
then oh nice ball over the
top a wasteful from the
Destroyers Zan
rice the clock is against Arsenal but
what can they pull out of the fire
[Applause]
here and and teammates around
him King the verdict is offside
here substitution then let's see how it
affects the
match and possession lost by The Dream
Destroyers
barelli nice he'd be disappointed if he
didn't take that one
[Applause]
cleanly what can he do with it
now well it wasn't a high percentage
chance to add to their advantage but an
opportunity nonetheless well that would
have made it more comfortable but it was
a decent effort from there I have to
say
[Applause]
[Applause]
well we are going to have a decent
amount of stoppage time three minutes to
be
exact bukayo
Saka Dean
rice time and the score line against AR
but still they're in
this Cristiano
Ronaldo
Daniel good
distribution and it will be an Arsenal
free
[Applause]
kick
[Applause]
and that is that the referee blows his
whistle for full time and it's a victory
for the visitors well they play a lot
better than they did today and not win
the game but they stayed focused showed
a lot of character and eventually got a
very good
result
[Applause]
I guess I'll try cooler

right up it's is Manchester City against
the dream destroyers yes thanks as
always Derek we've got two good teams
here so I'm anticipating a really good
game the atmosphere is electric inside
the stadium before kickoff and hopefully
we're not
disappointed and sloted home well his
heart might have been fluttering but he
didn't show it a goal from the
spot well here's the table and it's
clear to see why there's been so much
dis appointment amongst the Arsenal fans
they have been playing below
expectations you've got to see well it's
been such a disappointing season with
the squad they have they should be going
for the title they've been far too
inconsistent both in terms of effort and
quality
Davies interception to Snuff out the
danger Seto that wide area is really
opening
up it has gone over the touch line for
what'll be a throw in
[Applause]
Holland well that's really strong play
to keep hold of the ball
greish well somehow the goalkeeper got
to
[Applause]
