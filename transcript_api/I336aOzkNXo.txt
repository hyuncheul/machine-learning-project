T plays ballant
role oh my God see I don't want to say
he's playing incorrectly cuz he has the
aim to back it up if you swing this and
get like one kill unless you're him
which I guess TS is him once you get
this first kill all three people are
just going to be staring at you you have
aim like this you can do whatever you
want I guess honestly yeah like I mean
you can literally just do whatever you
want it just doesn't
matter nice
