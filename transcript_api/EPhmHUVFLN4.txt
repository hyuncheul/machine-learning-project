blind rank these knife skins in valerent
your first option is the blast X knife I
think the blast X knife is good but not
too crazy so I'm going just put it a
four fair enough your second knife is
the ignite fan I'm not a huge fan of the
ignite fan but I don't want to put it a
five so I'm going to just put it a three
I guess that's fair your third option is
the singularity knife The Singularity
knife can be cool but can also be really
basic so I'm going to just put it at
five okay understandable your second
last option is the Scythe the Scythe had
so much potential but it's bad and I
only have one and two left so I'm
putting it at two actually facts it was
such wasted potential the last knife and
by default your number one choice is the
Reva Gambit yeah
