Stuart your expectations well I've
enjoyed watching them up to this point

they'll need to be at their very best to
win here I
think able to clear the danger at least
for
[Applause]
now
Pino opportunity in the wide
area but the danger averted for now oh a
superb
[Applause]
save
and options in the
center and the keeper collects under a
bit of
pressure well we simply had to feature
him today after he broke the club's goal
scoring record in his last appearance
yeah what a goal scorer but I'm sure
there's still a lot more to come from
this player including today maybe it's a
remarkable
achievement an almost instinctive
clearance and a corner
now
it has gone over the touch line for
what'll be a throw
in
h
h
for
that's
for
that's
the focus is on a player bang in form
and brimming with confidence three goals
in three games prove positive of that
can he keep his opponents on their toes
and deliver another top level
display

anticipating a really good game the
atmosphere is electric inside the
stadium before kickoff and hopefully
we're not
disappointed nice looking pass it comes
to nothing in the
end tremendously strong in the
tackle
roitz a tremendous
Vision clearly took a touch on the way
out of play so a throw in to
come
kitki and making sure nothing un to
happened following the
cross well some players are more
conscious than others of Milestones when
they come around but it is an important
occasion this well 50 games for this
club now and I'm expecting a lot more in
the future this is a really talented
player who is getting better all the
[Applause]
time over the touch line for a throw
in couldn't hang on to the
ball good distrib
ution now delivering that deep cross oh
tremendous goal technical Excellence to
finish that one off wonderful to have
that in your
repertoire One n
then
[Applause]
Kagawa
Pino well making considerable progress
with the
ball now he must favor the
cross and behind it's gone for a
corner
let's see about the
delivery Corner conceded an unfussy
[Applause]
clearance and the keeper left us in no
doubt that that was always going to be
his
[Applause]
ball
options in the middle the keeper knew it
was crucial he didn't make a
mistake and passing it well pressing
high up has its advantages oh that's a
fine
[Applause]
save
can he deliver it with
accuracy and the danger is
averted and easily
[Applause]
intercepted and it's played into the
center a very effective
clearance
well the referee not too happy with the
challenge and blows for a free
kick and a good looking ball pretty come
aable piece of
[Applause]
Defending
Mii a very good
tackle and a throw in it's going to
[Applause]
be
well they have the ball once
[Applause]
more well good run this now what can he
do with it but timely defending when it
mattered he's very adapt for protecting
the ball
Kagawa unable to keep the ball that
time
[Applause]
Bale
vitki after the foul a chance to
contemplate what is next and perhaps a
goal from this free
kick great
defending another
block well he has players waiting at the
back post and a goal to really bolster
things for them two in
front so the ball rolling again at
[Applause]
2-0 onto
Kagawa
Bale a decisive clearance it
was angles it
back can they keep it out goalkeeping of
the highest order well he's got to be
pleased with that save it's absolutely
[Music]
magnificent
[Applause]
now sending it in not too fussy in
clearing his
lines counterattacking
chance the fans are shouting shoots well
the keeper reacted
magnificently well this has to be their
way back into the gate the crowd are
certainly playing their part and there's
the
delivery
Pino and threading it through now he's
got to stay calm he had to score and he
[Applause]
does well you've got to say an
incredible first T performance that
score line tells you all you need to
know well the referee has instructed the
fourth official to put two minutes on
the
board that's a very fine piece of
[Applause]
tackling and the managers will now
deliver their halim team talks we're at
the
okay
well they've got things going again here
and I wonder what kind of second half we
have in store for
us and the ruling is offside
here
TR
now Roy incisive
[Applause]
pass credit to them for winning back
possession now with
Bruno
Bale
onto
Bruno play to the Box oh such an elegant
finish how about that on the volley a
brilliant strike whatever way you look
at it and this is turning into something
of a route
4-0 tror with it onto Kagawa super
tackle and they've won
possession
this is
Bruno not quite the cross he was hoping
for well the visitors have controlled
possession as you can see yes they've
played well when going forward but it's
been their ability to regain the ball
which has made them so hard to play
against the and it makes them such a
good team it's been a brilliant
performance so
far good piece of
Defending
Bale might be able to produced from this
position that's excellent defending
following the
cross onto Bruno
30 minutes left for
[Applause]
play couldn't hang on to
it from one side of the pitch to the
other kositsky and now they have the
ball
back the referee's letting it go as they
keep the
ball now the attack fizzled
out Mo Ali can you please meet Jennifer
bazette
off the snuffing out of the Cross
there effective
challenge well there was impending
danger but good defending
Pino on no lck keeping
[Applause]
possession 20 minutes to go in this
one well these fans have stared to make
their way to the here the game is surely
Beyond them
[Applause]
now
Bale Divo well unable to hold his run
and that's
offside said really well to get through
and still
dangerous
well able to survive that attacking
push well doesn't have to do it on his
own poor attempt to a pass
really
Yi
tror not the best Challenge free
kick
Yi well there to
intercept so on the cusp of the final
whistle and the visitors is very much in
command Stuart
well what an excellent performance this
has been they've had complete control
for most of the game their movement
clever passing and energy have been a
joy to watch it's been a really good win
for
them well he really read that
brilliantly this might be the perfect
counterattacking
opportunity must be well somehow the
goalkeeper got to
it and there's the
delivery clears it
away nice waight on the
pass must score oh dealt with by the
[Applause]
goalkeeper
who's going to get on the end of it it
hasn't come to very
much
and possession changing
hands if you're wondering about stoppage
time one and there it is a goal but will
it be purely a consolation at this stage
of the proceedings they haven't been at
the
[Applause]
best not too much defending going on in
the grand scheme of things 4-1 and there
it is the fulltime whistle here and it's
a victory
their play going forward really Lively
almost cutting through at will at times
the result was never much in doubt if
I'm
honest
you
the focus is on a player banging for and
brimming with confidence three goals and
three games prove positive of that can
he keep his opponents on their toes and
deliver another top level
[Music]
display next on EA
TV one of the great things about
football is that no one knows for sure
what going to happen let's see what
unfolds here tonight I'm Derek Ray and
I'm joined for expert analysis by Stuart
Robson and on the menu today club's
match action for you to enjoy how's it
going to go Stuart thanks Derek as
always this should be a good game great
atmosphere inside the stadium we've got
two teams full of quality some
interesting matchups and two coaches
that want to play an attractive brand of
football what more could you ask
for well back and forth in terms of of
[Applause]
possession
rosinski Bale and it's a quality
pass oh the keeper made it look routine
it was anything
[Applause]
[Music]
but
trying to deliver it accurately textbook
goalkeeping following the
[Applause]
corner well you never quite know who's
going to dominate a game in advance but
I think you can maybe make an argument
for this fellow Stuart what do you think
we'll see from him today well the game
plan of the the coach is to get the ball
into the front players as quickly as
possible he is the player to do it he's
brilliant with his back to goal we link
up the play and he's key to the way they
play the
game it's wholehearted defending and the
concession of a corner
here danger
averted danger averted for now but it'll
be another
corner it might still be problematic
and a goal right off the bat no wonder
they're jumping for
joy and back on theway one n it
[Applause]
is
Pino and he did well to cut it
out and with that they thwarted the
opportunity
Yi
Bale space on the
flank targets available cross comes in
not the best
[Applause]
clearance
well a disappointing throw
there
kyth to the
footballer on to Bruno
and now do they mean business on this
occasion and it might be oh a really
crisp effort but just
[Applause]
wide
Walter oh wonderful bit of
skill and a decent
delivery well not quite the header he
had in mind and the goalkeeper gobbling
that one up
Pino that's a good looking ball oh a
smart
[Applause]
stop and he's fired over the corner
disappointing delivery sailing over
everyone in the
middle breaking at
PACE and the Counterattack came to
[Applause]
[Applause]
Nothing Now options are
plenty must score more and he's kept it
out fully stretched somehow reaching
[Applause]
it and there's the delivery and dealing
with the danger crossed accurately
towards the far
post well they can keep possession of it
now brilliant pass and that is
[Applause]
offside next book
[Applause]
interception
Bale Crossing into the middle attending
to his defensive
chores what was the chance they could
get caught out on the break
here will it be sufficiently imaginative
and they'll regard that as a very
disappo it should be shot blocked but
still alive
could cross it in
here oh toward it there and what a piece
of Defending we've just
witnessed and very nicely positioned to
win it back how can they find the magic
they need from this
[Applause]
corner
[Applause]
over it comes in a good position to
clear it
away just have to make sure they don't
get caught on the
Counterattack oh that's an interesting
pass he might be on to something and how
about that for a
[Applause]
save well nothing comes of
[Applause]
it if you're wondering about stoppage
time one minute to be added
on the first half here comes to an
end
I
like
so back underway and an intriguing
second half in
[Applause]
Prospect
Yi that's a good looking
ball might be able to get in behind the
defense pulls it
back oh a level the match what was going
to be the goalkeeper's
[Applause]
ball and now King and good use of a oh
he's through here and there it is the
goal they wanted for security they lead
by two now they can breathe that bit
more
[Applause]
easily CR to attack from the wide areas
that's an effective cross aimed at the
back post well in fact a bit too close
to the goalkeeper and that was always
was going to be claimed
Bale
[Applause]
Bale and the flag raised offside it
[Applause]
is
Kane what can they do from
here
guy coming put it away a goal here
giving his team precisely what they were
looking for now he deserves to celebrate
it now with
Bruno well there to
intercept and into the last 30 minutes
now
could be
dangerous oh and it goes now he has his
hattick a special moment for
him and this is turning into something
of a route
4-n and quick thinking
defensively and he has options
available
not out of the woods
yet well goal kick just as it was
looking
[Applause]
[Applause]
promising
Bruno brilliant
pass and the goalkeeper taking
[Applause]
charge attacking with
Vigor looked as though they had
attacking momentum but not so and really
pressing their
opponents
bail what a magnificent
pass really fine piece of and a big
moment because the referee has pointed
to the spot penalty coming
up well he's avoided a booking but the
complaints continue and and confidently
converted goals in plentiful Supply 4-1
currently and behind it's gone for a
[Applause]
corner played
over well behind for another
[Applause]
Corner well not away
properly and a time for calm on the ball
this might be ideal for the
counter and a significant block
following that cross took a Nick on the
way through so a corner
here
and taken
short oh fine
stop real chance and there it is an
almost intuitive piece of
finishing
so the current score line
[Applause]
42 showing good defensive
judgment No Nonsense
[Applause]
clearance
just 10 minutes remaining
here well doesn't have to do it on his
own and played in oh another goal you
just cannot keep them down and it sets
up a Furious
[Applause]
finish well how about this
[Applause]
43
well time is of some concern can they
level
matters but they dealt with the threat
[Applause]
posed
Walter on high marks for that
pass delivering it into the box they'll
dealt with that ball
comfortably
well these fans are right behind the
team here can they get the equalizer
though well a clear foul but the referee
letting the play
Flow space on the
flank this could level it oh it's in one
of the most miraculous comebacks you're
ever likely to see and just look at the
celebration and a goal at this stage
might well turn out to be decisive
now totaling up all the stoppages we'll
have two additional minutes oh fine play
and maybe it'll set something
[Applause]
up and they'll get ready for the throw
in now he must favor the
cross and keeping it
out well you just never know about
chances near the end you've got to be
opportunistic will this corner do
it play over outrageously good piece of
Defending on the
line so the final whistle and the end of
an evenly fought contest but focusing on
the hosts what about their performance
Derek you can't
always the he was outstanding in in
front of goal but it still wasn't enough
to get the victory some of their
defending was really
[Applause]
poor
everyone on tenter hooks you can feel
the tension because there's so much on
the line if they win they make it
through to the promotion match it is
that simple do they have the mental
fortitude
necessary this meeting live next on
eatv
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be in trolling my name
is Derek Ray and my commentary partner
as usual is Stuart Robson and the Chance
is on for them to reserve for themselves
a promotion match Place how do you see
the match going Stuart well Derek it's
certainly in their hands if they win
here a promotion match will be theirs
they just need to put in a good
performance it will won't be easy
though that's a very impressive piece of
[Applause]
Defending
vitki
neni will he play it
in well cleared
[Applause]
away and that puts them in position
could be a magnificent stop well it
should be a goal but take nothing away
from the keeper that's a brilliant
save well who will be the player to
decide the outcome to determine the
course of events no reason at all why it
won't be this man Stuart what do you
anticipate seeing from him big moment
this oh that's an expert piece of
Defending just as it was looking
threatening oh good
Vision really fine piece of Defending
play to break us
up
[Applause]
Yi
and a throw in fourth
[Applause]
coming and the cross into the middle oh
that's a super piece of
[Applause]
Defending
harik
what a magnificent pass obvious
offside using space on the opposite
flank
now not to like about that
pass can they Forge ahead they do and
you've got to say they're good value for
the
lead
[Applause]
well here we can see it again look at
the way he Glides past the defender to
create space for himself but then you
have to ask what's going on with the
defending he's afforded far too much
time nowhere near enough pressure on him
and they're punished as a
[Applause]
result
[Applause]
Harvey
a terrific defending to stop them
[Applause]
progressing a very effective
[Applause]
clearance untiy in
possession
and the danger
cleared very alert defending to cut off
the
supply well doesn't have to do it on his
own oh great vision and he clears the
danger and everyone in the center
looking on as it sailed over
them
rosit
[Applause]
K what can they do from
here good use of Advantage
there Bale that's a nice looking ball
plattered away well they've won
themselves a corner and a chance perhaps
to add an additional goal for
[Applause]
security but he's gone short with
[Applause]
it clearance left a bit to be
desired still possibilities and in it
goes from the goalkeeper's point of view
so
disappointing
and the ball is moving again 2-n is how
it
[Applause]
[Applause]
stands now with Bruno but putting in
quite the shift to win the ball
back and scope for for them to produce
something exciting it comes to
absolutely
[Applause]
nothing vitki tremendous
challenge could be threatening but a
crucial intervention Inside the
[Applause]
Box
Harvey
well halime almost upon us and playing
away from home isn't bothering them in
the slightest Stuart how about your take
yes it's been a really energetic display
from them so far the passing's been
sharp the movement from the front
players has been excellent and the
finishing has been clinical they will
certainly be happy going in at
halim and with that the first half draws
to a close
[Applause]
[Applause]
64
[Applause]
away they go again second half is
underway
here
[Applause]
that's a good
ball oh he looks threatening could be
well not quite accurate enough but it
was a close
[Applause]
thing
Yami and the attacking options appear
plentiful
[Applause]
[Applause]
harik
[Applause]
Harvey keeping it on the ground slightly
off Target
however
jeo could cross it in here excellent
[Applause]
defending
oh that's a really good run and this
time it's in fabulous goal and just look
at the
celebrations this is looking rather
comfortable for them 3
n good ball over the
top not a promising looking attack but
comes to nothing in the
end they might be able to get get in
now oh yes it's gone in and now a chance
for them to reel in the
moment
[Applause]
K Divo well when you have the lead you
can play in this manner keeping the ball
like this what a magnificent
pass and a goal it was served up on a
silver platter for
him well not too much defending going on
in the grand scheme of things
[Applause]
4-1
[Applause]
Harvey
onto
Bruno Bale not to like about that pass
well without putting too fine a point on
it he's missed
it well those stats back up what we've
been watching has been a really
one-sided game and it's far too easy for
them to open up this defense this could
turn into a
route Now options are plenty oh
tremendous VIs
and steered back under a bit of
pressure the high press was on and
that's a fantastic
[Applause]
tackle really good buildup but no end
[Applause]
product
harik
heni
Harvey and take it away attending to his
defensive
chores
Bale
[Applause]
K 15 minutes left for play
well these fans are starting to leave
here there's just no chance of a
comeback
now foul there free kick
[Applause]
[Applause]
awarded
on the cross not sufficiently well
played
in well clearing it away but at the
expense of a
corner and short it is and crossed in
there well high and more than a bit
[Applause]
hopeful
now looking dangerous
here well defending always has to be a
team effort good piece of covering the
concession of a corner
here
oh good play this and the goalkeeper has
outdone himself with that
[Applause]
save well they fancy a short
one and there's the feed Le into the
[Applause]
box threat over for now it
seems so on the cusp of the final
whistle and the visitors very much in
command Stuart well what an excellent
performance this has been they've had
complete control for most of the game
their movement clever passing and energy
have been a joy to watch it's been a
really good win for
them well the fans really want him to
shoot
jeo well couldn't keep
it the referee allowing the play to
flow Bale that's a useful cross but
goalkeeper's ball disappointingly for
them well it wasn't superb distribution
by The Keeper that we can
say
and so the final whistle here the
visitors come out on top Stewart you're
absolutely right Derek their attacking
play was excellent full of energy and
pace and the Midfield completely
dominated the
[Applause]
game
[Applause]
ni
from here on in everything possesses an
extra Edge that extra bit of pressure
and the players know they've got to
deliver it's the first promotion match
so much on the line and we can't wait
for the
excitement this meeting live next on
[Applause]
eatv
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be olling my name is
Derek Ray and my commentary partner as
usual is Stuart Robson and today it's
their first promotion match in this
division Stuart what are you expecting
yeah thanks Derek this should be a good
game so far they've done really well to
be in this position now they need to put
in another decent performance it's a big
game for
them and active
[Applause]
Challenge
everra and the keeper with the
ball
kaloo a really single-minded piece of
Defending to make sure nothing unto
happen the referee spotted the little
Nick on the way through so a throw in
coming
up nice looking pass well not away
[Applause]
properly well they can't quite take
advantage in the
end well a very important record broken
last time out you're looking at the
club's new alltime top scorer well he's
got the record but he's such a good goal
scorer I'd expect him to add a lot more
to his tally starting today what a
talent he
is and coly done despite the mounting
pressure your wife is waiting for you
thank
you the attack continues they're making
considerable
progress but a good piece of Defending
to bring it to an
[Applause]
end and now Sanchez good
[Applause]
tackle well that is how to play
Advantage well no advantage in the end
and she'll pull it back for the free
kick
baale good through
[Applause]
ball Jin it might
be and the goal to give them the lead
they have their
[Applause]
reward
everra D
[Applause]
Roi but he was in the right place to
intercept and the non nonsense
[Applause]
clearance just cutting off the
supply
Yi good ball to switch the
play might work out big
opportunity oh a goal and a known goal
at that well not part of the script was
it so the ball rolling again at
2-n
Sanchez that's a good
[Applause]
ball
now let's see what they can do
here and teammates to play it to well it
did look promising but no threat in the
[Applause]
end and the deflection there before it
went over the by line going to be a
[Applause]
corner
[Applause]
taken
short now will the cross work out for
them textbook defending inside the
box dicing with a bit of danger here and
that's gone out of play for what will be
a goal
kick
this is
Bruno possession Changing
Hands this could be Troublesome but how
well he did to react in that
[Applause]
manner Pino
an effective
[Applause]
challenge
[Applause]
Parker
Bruno oh great
Vision cross could be useful well
nothing wrong with the header but it was
always going that little bit off
[Applause]
Target D
rosi
kaloo oh nice
ball chance to cross the inside route
looking
promising fine tackle there to prevent
the chance Racing for forward trying to
catch them out can they take
[Applause]
advantage really clever
pressing cuts it
[Applause]
back a chance then for the respective
managers to address their charges it is
halime here
a lot of
[Applause]
best away they go again second half is
underway
[Applause]
here
this is looking
[Applause]
threatening might be on to something
with that
ball well they're going to be very
crossed with themselves because that was
a wasted
opportunity B
Divo well they couldn't keep
[Applause]
it
Yi would be a bit annoyed to have lost
the
ball can he make it count and the keeper
will happily collect that
[Applause]
one
[Applause]
good through
ball really fine piece of Defending play
to break us
up excellent use of the ball as they
make their way forward they'll be
breathing a sigh of relief ball
one counterattacking
chance and the Counterattack came to
nothing
well this is better but they need to
make the pressure count
now and a foul in the opinion of the
referee now what can they do from this
free kick
situation just lacked a bit of
conviction and straight into the
wall and not an attempt he'll be
terribly proud
[Applause]
of
rosinski Yi plenty of forward momentum
here but can they
[Applause]
produce well the fans want to see a shot
and the referee blows for a
[Applause]
foul and players waiting in the
center real determination and the
challenge a throw in
here
a bit of Running Room now on the wing
that's a useful cross oh such an elegant
finish how about that on the volley a
brilliant strike whatever way you look
at it this is
Bruno Sanchez individual Brilliance well
danger a thanks to his
teammates over the touch line for a
throw
[Applause]
in D
Rossi now
Sanchez into the final 20
minutes excellent ball over the top
[Applause]
just the clearance that was
needed really good
[Applause]
challenge well in the final analysis a
bit
harmless can he take advantage
and a goal it is the keeper really not
part of the
equation well the action continues and
no shortage of goals 3-1 as things
stand D
Roi
Evra now
Sanchez
Parker possession and patience the
watchwords and a fine
cross well all doing their bit to keep
them
out 10 minutes to go
then lot to like about that pass and a
loss of concentration oh the threat is
there vital
[Applause]
intervention
and now Sanchez oh that's a super ball
over the
[Applause]
top well but all was said and done he's
failed to hit the
[Applause]
target
Bale
K it is to be a throw
[Applause]
in well possession
[Applause]
seeded now they've lost it
and he has options
available the
delivery last man back and job
done well the counter chance looks very
real and options in the center will it
be sufficiently imaginative and they've
wasted the chance for nor said and done
oh dear well the Finish didn't match the
buildup play that was a really good
Counterattack
and there goes the final whistle and the
home fans are going to be happy
about the part well going forward there
was some really nice incisive play too
it's a good result for
[Applause]
them
done
I
