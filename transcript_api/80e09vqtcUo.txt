War pugs it's that time again it's that
time of year where League of Legends
announces the new season of
ranked and the time of year in
which I have to debate losing another
half inch off my hairline this year from
trying to play league
ranked and
um I'm hoping that I haven't played in
months I haven't played in months
I'm resisting the Sinister urge to down
log league but with that being said what
do I want to see out of this year well
last year we got Jen so I'm not going to
get Jen again this year that's not
happening um based off the thumbnail
alone maybe trendir is in this one which
would be he's a little bit overdue if
you ask me but um P that I don't know
who else is going to be in this
um the music's going to be awesome it
has been the last few years so let's
jump into this like And subscribe guys
and we're just going to we're going to
roll let's
go leave a comment Who's your main it's
a hope Kindred never a
promise okay
trir which means Ash is going to be in
here
somewhere
Morana and
[Music]
kale
[Music]

[Music]

well
[Applause]
yep
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
there's
Ash I'm still here
okay okay
okay the music is awesome as I thought
it
was I thought the music was going to be
awesome okay first off trendir trendir
and Ash are
married um that's why I figured she was
going to be in here kale and Morgana
getting
along and Morgana with her sword
fighting
atrox
that I didn't see but this is
awesome I Morgana is the best sister
just saying she is the best
sister
um and that look from kale is pretty
much the entire Dynamic of their whole
thing
H can't do we have to have one who
dispenses wend in every single trailer
for this at this
point can we not over the past few years
I'm just
saying
um once again they put yasu in here
yasu's kind yasu they keep on trying to
push him toward the front every single
year with this stuff
um and I get there's a thousand yasua
Fanboys are going to be 100% oh yeah
tornado again yay but I've never been a
fan of yasua but that's just me
um this whole thing this whole sequence
between trendir and um
Kindred this works on another different
level because basically Tren amir's ult
is where he just doesn't die and kred is
death so I really like that it was like
a double un Tandra but it is what it is
war
pugs and then finally Ash in a cinematic
trailer I haven't seen her in one of
these I don't think ever but I could be
wrong about that I could be dead wrong
about that is it just me or did Ash's
voice lines get like three times longer
when they read her voice lines like
she's still T like she spawns in starts
talking and doesn't stop for the whole
game I I I don't understand it but
that's not neither here nor there I
still think she's a great
champ
um yeah I really like this this is good
this was this was really good I enjoyed
this but please can we can yon come in
can we tag yon into this let's go War
pugs I can't and I can't wait for the I
can't wait for what's going to come out
