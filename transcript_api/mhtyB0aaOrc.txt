the day is here the match everyone has
been talking about and with good reason
two teams of Strong pedigree rich and
Talent on the cusp of going head-to-head
in a highly significant confrontation
with so much to play for how will it pan
[Applause]
out stay tuned we'll have all the action
for you live from London here on EA
TV delighted to be able to report but
the weather has cooperated here at the
Emirates Stadium in North London I'm
Derek Ray and my commentary partner as
always is Stuart Robson and it's all
about action from the Premier League in
this case it's Arsenal up against
Crystal Palace well Derek as is always
the case the team that dominates
Midfield would be the team that controls
the flow of the game and that for me is
the area that's key
today and so they stting 11 for Arsenal
Martin erigor plays alongside Dean rice
in central Midfield and the focal point
in attack is Gabrielle
[Applause]
Jesus
Schoop options in the
center and a chance for the
[Applause]
lead trying to find the right angle of
attack and there it is the opening goal
the ideal way to
start well here it is again and the
defending simply isn't good enough they
have to react quicker deal with the
danger and show more urgency none of
which they did and that's the
[Applause]
result
[Applause]
Arsenal restart the game then and they
have work to do as they try to wipe out
that last
goal
havet might work
out and it's Gabrielle
Jesus well showing excellent judgment to
intercept
odson
[Applause]
eduar now with
LMA can they open things up teammate

executed

[Applause]
Box Joel

aayu possession lost by

erard Gabrielle
Martinelli well still searching for The
Equalizer but not passing it
anxiously
well they stopped them in their
tracks
[Applause]
aayu wilting under the pressure and now
they try to go
forward can he play it
[Applause]
inz it's up up for hits oh not to be
stopping a certain
goal and there it is the referee's

[Applause]
Defending
GUI well we have 30 minutes to
go and fine work from Arsenal to win it
[Applause]
back Gabrielle
Martinelli oh left his man behind here
will he shoot the fans hope so they keep
PL in
away Top Class
defending odson
eduar and it's Gabrielle
Jesus this could be the equalizer
element of risk there but he's won the
ball oddson
eduar and Hughes has
it
and into the last 20
minutes well just listen to these
Arsenal fans they're certainly driving
their team forward
here and promising stuff from
Arsenal could play it in the cut back
opportunity to level
it
[Applause]
odson
eduar and Hughes has
[Applause]
it
eie and edir with
it decent progress with the ball at his
feet doing well to win it back what can
they do from
here
well nearing the end of the game an
Arsenal with work to do you've got to
say Stewart well I think their forward
players being poor today they've not had
enough movement from the front players
and the Midfield have been too safe with
their passing unless that changes in
these final few moments they'll get
nothing from this
game we might very well have late
excitement here 5 minutes to go and just
one goal between
[Applause]
them and team teammates around
him and it's Gabrielle Jesus this could
Square the
game really clever
pressing who can he pick
out Ben
[Applause]
White oh crucial tackle
brilliant so the final whistle now and
disappointment for Arsenal you've got to
say a for them your assessment well
Derek it was a hardfought contest which
neither side completely dominated but
the result will certainly hurt them they
need to bounce back next time
