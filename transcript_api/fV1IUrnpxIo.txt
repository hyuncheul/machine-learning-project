hey what's up people welcome to the
final episode of guess the rank where I
watch viewer submitted clips and guess
your rank based on what I see and we're
actually going to do golf scoring this
time so the closer that I get to the
actual rank the less points I
get
uh honestly maybe diamond diamond yeah
another another vein in the same
[Music]
spot spacing is
good Box's
[Music]
good this this one Masters I think oh
Emerald this one was a better clip than
the other
one another vein dude what is going on
this is vein right yeah these Skins are
crazy
now if you
can oh oh sh oh sh
oh okay
[Music]
okay oh I I miss it I got to miss it I
got to miss
it I I think this one is probably
Masters this one was the best
mechanical out of the
three man it's Emerald
[Music]
again
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so far he's playing well did you see
that overlay that's from the sponsor of
today's video poro FES so PO fessor is
an app that runs on overw for League
completely compliant with all of
League's terms of service but giving you
a massive advantage in and out of game
you can import your ruins before the
game starts in the loading screen you
can see important information like if
your teammates are one tricking
something and playing that one trick if
they're first timing a champion if
they're on a win streak if they're on a
lose streak all that info is going to
help you play better in the game you can
look at the postmatch game breakdown and
analytics which will help you figure out
how you can improve from game to game
you know for example if you're last
hitting is kind of poor if you're dying
a lot or getting caught solo a lot poor
Professor will help you up your game
that way and you can join over 8 million
other submers that use poor Professor by

Masters now diamond diamond diamond
diamond
oh what am I
watching he's playing dodgeball with
them okay I'm supposed to guess the rank
of this guy
like honestly this guy's probably like
plat like it's just he's just around in
practice tool there's no way it's a high
rated player right oh I'm insane right
now
ew no this war Box's not very
good no this orbu is not very
[Applause]
good oh that Lilia W from Spawn wow that
was funny I'm going to say
gold emerald again damn it
I'm going crazy
today who is this am I watching
Jinx ew
ew oh no I did not like that at
all that was a mistake to flash like
that any standing still I think gold
that's gold or silver FL dude close
though FL
QE edge the
turret it's hard to tell he played that
about as well as he possibly could have
I'm going to say diamond again or
Masters diamond or Masters let me let me
look at it again actually before I take
a guess I want to see how how Sam Mir
[Music]
played
Samir didn't play
[Music]
well e i I kind of want to say gold now
because of the way Samir played I I
think it's nothing to do with Leona
Leona played it well but gold because of
Samira yeah thank God he played that
really bad sorry I need to I need to
rewatch it again I I don't know what I'm
watching initially it's silus
TP Dian
ulti
bit bit early on the E I think he should
hold it next
time no flash on the
stun E I
mean
ooh it looks more impressive than it
is that was actually not very well
played flat flat
diamond
dude they're speaking Russian wait
want to watch how did how
did this one must be plat I think or
silver maybe I'm going to say plat I'm
going to say
plat damn it my second guess is always
I'm going to go my second guess from now
on flash man ooh nice by Pike
what oh wait I'm soing bad
exhaust exhaust exhaust him exhaust
him oh
no bronze bronze bronze bronze bronze
bronze bronze
Challenger [ __ ] he got me he got me good
he got me good oh my God it's high ofm
hot GF this has to be autofield player I
there's no way right like there's just
no way with how he's moving his with how
he's moving his Mouse as well one one of
the things I always check for when I
watch Like perspective
ADC it it does tend to show me if
someone is good or not is like like how
far away are they clicking from their
character flash
man oh my oh my goodness oh my goodness
hold on hold on wait wait just wait just
wait just wait so now now he's clicking
like
hold on wait
wait oh oh he's actually clicking fine
he's clicking fine there was a few times
where his mouse was really far away from
his character like it was like 500 range
away oh my God honestly unlucky with the
Q damn that was challenging though okay
let's see
Caitlyn
huh okay I mean that wasn't that wasn't
that was nothing let's see it let's see
it what do you got
put your trap down nice placement on the
Trap like you oh but you didn't you
didn't hit him off of it oh well
played well played but you you didn't
hit him off of it
earlier okay yon should be charging Q3
off the wave but he did
not
nice oh the movement has been very good
the movement has been very good what is
that slowing him by the way this is a
very old clip if that storm Razer
slowing
him oh
my that's a tough one to guess I'm going
to guess GM I'm going to guess
GM a so
close
M low low ooh Platinum
Platinum damn it really really
gold I was thinking Platinum are diamond
so I wasn't even thinking
gold
okay BL
Flash
oh
nice oh
oh I just got to keep guessing plat at
this point plat plat in hell man I just
have to keep guessing flat because it's
so hard man
Diamond the other one was going that one
was Diamond I feel like the H that one
was a good Cliff actually I'm I'm not
giving him enough credit it's just like
now I'm just like playing
games with like how I think it should be
distributed on the
ranks let's see oh good and take it nice
wait ulti take
it
okay bit crazy I okay go plat plat plat
I got to commit plat man
really I should have I should have known
it was bronze what
the it's getting worse man I'm getting
more and more off oh nice like the block
the block was a bit unnecessary flash
for it flash for it nice heal don't heal
your teammate okay come
on oh this is low I'm please let it be
gold please let it be gold
what how was a
diamond he's not even like weaving his q
and auto together man [ __ ] it's so
hard oh my God e
smurfing oh my God okay wait hold on
hold on hold on let me let me rewatch it
from his POV I wasn't I didn't know who
I was looking at so I'm looking at
Ezreal and he's getting ganked by rexi
okay let's see it hold on so okay
arrowed now now what happens he e in
instead of out and then what does he
flash he doesn't really flash anything
in general though I think that that was
a great play Masters Masters
Masters Platinum dude these are really
hard to to call these are super hard to
call I'm watching Braum I
think he then I'm sure at some point he
hits three and then oh oh
oh yeah he hits three or oh he oh oh
it's so hard to call it's so hard to
call I think Diamond I think Diamond
that was
good
dude oh SE ball

it okay let's see that was good nice
nice W's up W's up W's up oh ooh Jesus
he he played the beginning
Well w out and then ring back in for the
auto then W is up again at the
end went for an e instead okay well I
mean w would have been useless to use
there what kind of player would make a
play like that surely Platinum surely
Platinum surely Platinum
what nah I'm not guessing silver on that
play guys not guessing silver on that
play hell
no hell no I'm guessing silver on that
play this is Adar I
think okay well the fact that you're
playing
adari already makes me think this is
like low ELO like low as Gila I don't

you're doing I'm just I'm just stunned
about adari and I don't even know what's
