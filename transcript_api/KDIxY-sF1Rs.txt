this is recurring image so
far chills chills just everything coming
together the music the characters the
emotion the choreography the lighting
look at
this on my League of Legends cinematic
Journey we finally come to still here
season 2024 cinematic League of Legends
I've covered many League of Legends
cinematics on this channel and enjoyed
them so much so I can't wait to see what
this is all about and I also love Arcane
so that being said let's check it out if
you've been enjoying our time together
please consider checking out some of the
other videos we' covered on this channel
including our ongoing cinematic journey
through World of Warcraft League of
Legends L Masters join me in battle once
again is a
hope never a promise o oh what an
opening line and look at
that surrounded and hopeless so what a
what a powerful image just thr
with oh look at the anime man they've
upu the uh they've up the anti much like
Warcraft has with their Graphics
looking
oo okay so we're getting different
scenarios here different settings like
Valkyrie looking characters
here really
cool wow right on the beat drop there
nice
shot it coincides with the lyrics too
like daylight caught their eyes the Sun
comes to the
picture oh that was
awesome oh that muted sound design you
get that like echoey
feeling beautifully
done very Devil May Cry this guy which I
love my this is recurring image so far
we have the gentleman in the beginning
Who's down in the same way and
struggling to get back
up
whoa okay that was awesome the
music building
up look at that
look wow that's what I'm talking
about coinciding with the music the FL
just burn
through who creepy
[Music]
mess very cool he's got the jingasa
[Music]
Hat the recurring theme man of these
characters you know struggling to stand
up all right let's go look at the fight
choreogra did you see that staff break
[Music]
apart oh that was
amazing he broke it on the guy's
face no way
oh cut in half
yes okay this is awesome wait is this
the character from before I know one of
the characters has like tornadoes with
his sword did he
age
oh so
clean still here I love this feeling of
being you know we're we're beaten down
it's been we've been through War we've
been through hardship but we're still
here still standing so everybody's
finding their footing and kind of like
taking another step back into the battle
and here's the first
guy I love it we've had different
scenarios like kind of the same sort of
narrative and thematic feeling and now
we're coming back to this
guy what is that
wow the coloration too for each one is
so distinct we'll talk about
that what is his power his eyes turned
red
wow yes get him man get him I'm rooting
for this guy still
here wait what
what I'm
still an assist it's an
assist yes and the Smoke Clears and the
light comes
out an
[Music]
ally
[Music]
yes that was exceptional yeah I love the
feeling it's like I'm still here you
know we have we've been through so much
in this case an Al I don't think I know
many of these characters from the
previous stuff these might be new
characters for the season though so let
me know lore Masters what's going on
here maybe there people who've aged too
um like I said I know Arcane really well
but don't know as many of these
characters um there's a massive cast in
the game right but I loved it I want to
talk about the coloration for each one I
want to talk about the choreography and
a couple other great shot selection that
happened like I said if you're enjoying
our time together make sure to subscribe
hop into our Discord which has over a
thousand people amazing communities
people are making friends in there it's
the best and also if you want to choose
videos for me to react to click that
join button and go to the dragon tier
all right so let's look at this amazing
stuff I'm going to turn off the
subtitles to look deeper into this um
what's the line at the
beginning is a
hope tomorrow is a hope tomorrow is a
hope and look at the image like right
away it's just boom okay there it is you
know thematically it's it's all
there and there's a theme that pops up
in each one I really nice really nice
shots here it's cool because sort of the
the effect they have on the bokeh in
this which is what we call the out of
focus segments in the background is
beautiful stuff happening with the light
reflecting and everything the stuff
that's out of focus in the shallow dep
of field here it's giving the impression
of you know without getting too much
into the technical details really
expensive glass so it's like it's it
gives it a filmic sense in a very modern
sense uh for that reason so I love
it yeah beautiful
stuff and just look at the look at the
attention detail on his hair and his
beard and stuff like
exceptional really exceptional
work and just like you know that that
image there's so much emotion in that
there's so much emotion and and kind of
you know you can see the pain from the
battle on his face you can see that feel
feeling of like hope kind of fading a
little bit he's been fighting so
[Music]
long now what's interesting is this
could be the Ally that shows up at the
end I think is what's happening here so
I love that we kind of open um and medas
race as we call it in the middle of the
scene and we get to see this little
thing what's going on here is it an ally
is it an enemy is it going to finish him
off and then we cut to these other
scenarios that's only 29 seconds in we
come back to him at the end and sort of
this like thematic circle of other
characters going through the same thing
and it becomes this beautiful Montage um
it could have been cool to see this in a
different way actually I'd love to see
just a different edit and I wonder if
they did this as an experiment kind of
chopping it up a little bit more to go
back and forth between each one um
because that would be a really cool edit
too to the song but I kind of like how
there are separate episodes
[Music]
here this one's really cool too and
again they're like what's going on are
they inspecting the
dead they're on the battlefield they're
sort of like Valkyries
they seem to have some sort of Victory
here this is awesome too like for boing
imagery you know this I don't know what
exactly is happening but it doesn't look
good kind of like
apocalyptic yeah I love that too you
kind of get the reveal on the beat drop
uh cutting on the beat of the song
Always super effective and they're
they're all about it on the League of
Legends videos that I've seen before so
it's great to see that kind of editing
style back in
here exceptional exceptional shot here
so what's happening is we're following
uh we're motivating the camera movement
with the sort of
sweeping rotation of this guy's attack
Watch What
Happens and I love the speed wrapping
there so we get this kind of like
feeling where it just show how close of
call it was um to show the sort of skill
level of this character is really good
stretching out through
all
behind I like I like from sort of like
almost like a power scaling sense here
that we get the difference in size these
guys are enormous these guys are almost
like you know little animals compared to
him or something but they would
therefore probably be able to move
faster so I like how they kind of factor
that into the choreography like you can
only finally get this hand on the person
and throws him
down but it's kind of cool this you know
feeling of like Valkyries you know
people who have like the imagery of
Valkyries fighting in the heavens
fighting like some big demon and
everything it's very Divine and um you
know it has this sort of like very
high lofty feel to it and then of course
gets thrown down from the heavens and
this is just classical imagery of the
Heavens to we have this kind of like
look at this
shot beautiful you know the Rays of
light coming down through The Parting
the clouds and you get essentially what
is like an angel just cast down by a
demon which is an interesting twist
there um but I love it because the light
of the beautiful Divine feeling is you
know we're back on earth now and it's
cloudy so it's gone away and it kind of
gives this sort of subconscious feeling
of like oh okay you know like it's get
it's getting dark now things are
dire look at this guy I love that we get
the detail shot of the sword there um
it's like he's quite a monsterous being
so you know you kind of focus on the uh
the the horror of his weapons and
everything how dangerous it would be
that was a good shot sword's like
alive yeah really nice shot there too to
show the sword going in um again you
know different shot than we were showing
the threat of his sword with this
character we're showing her resilience
you know the feeling that she's going to
keep fighting sticking the sword in the
ground and this is it see this is the
same shot that's why I love the sort of
thematic feeling this right here
is see if I can nail it is is this you
know it's that same exact feeling it's
the same exact shot and it's honestly
the same exact uh composition we're
slightly punched in on this I go back to
where is it right here yeah it's the
same position the composition um is
really really beautiful so
clever and I love that it's it's the
same thing we cut from that guy seeing
his ally in the distance and his eyes
blinking uh to this same exact View
the Ally walking up to the enemy really
interesting I got to say that one more
time the power of the horns look at
this chills chills it's
beautiful just everything coming
together the music the characters the
emotion the chore phography the lighting
look at
this ah right to the song yeah so well
done so well done and like the way they
kind of use the the buildup of the music
[Music]
here what an image what an image again
sort of this Divine imagery here of like
Valkyries
fighting awesome so awesome yeah that
was a that's probably my favorite
segment from the video but let's keep
going um this is a third set piece
now we have these like villains
attacking this
person but again sort of same scene
layout here these people who need
help and they're like who's this you
know goofy goofball going to
defend say I'm really curious about this
specific character the Valkyries really
cool I'd love to know about their lore
for the lore Masters in chat here but
also this guy very
intriguing like I said there was a
character in one of the old cinematics
who had like a katana and could make
like a tornado am I thinking of
something
else I think what's Happening Here is
we're keeping his identity a mystery but
this is what I want to talk
about oh and what's happening is we kind
of have like a
you know a sound design that's happening
from the music so what happens is the
percussion in the song sounds like the
staff breaking uh as if it is diagetic
sound but it's not it's the sound for
the music so
listen so clever yeah really really love
that so this is the character reveal
right still here
[Music]
so cool what what I like about it from a
marshall sense too is you have the speed
ramping where it's just kind of like and
then it shows the Precision of his
strike not the power not the speed not
the destruction but the Precision look
at this so
clever and the the sort of concentration
moment there that he
takes and I love they show the speed
that he grabs the sword ah really really
good cut away there
yeah so
cool yeah so what I want to know is
where how do you guys rate this as
compared to the previous Seasons um
because this is this is really good I
feel how do you guys feel about this
2024 season compared to
2023
I really like those shots too there's a
bit of a um there's a shot right here
where you see
is it's focusing on sort of the Marshall
prow it's like look at the Precision of
his movement look at his steps
everything is just absolutely perfect
you
know so we cut away and you'll see like
the long shot of him like taking down
guys but they show that kind of the
cleanness of everything is really
good yeah really solid Choice by the
director
there
and I also like the kind of there's this
feeling where did you notice he closes
his
eyes and he kind of enters into this you
know like Marshall trance almost he
opens and it's just grabs the sword and
then at the end of that segment he
closes his eyes again some okay I'm G to
like become the old man again really
cool almost like almost like a Yoda from
Star Wars prequels where it just like
goes absolutely insane afterward it
grabs his walking cane again
you I mean let's talk about that
transition right this Arrow of
Light and it just becomes this awesome
transition it looks like broken glass
it's of course the sky from our poor
character's perspective snowflake coming
down and how cool is that so what's
What's Happening Here is
actually let me
see
so there's probably some lore here I
don't know about his sword but I really
like that the lyric there it's in my
blood it's in my veins as the snowflake
falls and hits the sword and almost
implies like the sword is powered by ice
or something but again just sort of like
a from a lore perspective from this
character's perspective he's a Warrior
by Blood you know it's it's who he is
his
identity I love that kind of Rouses
him you see these like specters yeah I
love the uh I love the reaction shots we
get in this whole thing thing there's a
lot of shots where we'll get cutaways to
the characters reacting to each other
reacting to the situation um a lot of
videos like this can be a little bit too
focused on the action which is great and
they're always exceptional but I love
that in this one we're getting these
intimate moments um because the the
Fidelity is so ridiculous you know show
us show us some acting it's
great yeah and it's kind of cool because
in this we don't have speaking except
for the opening line so it's really nice
to have um these
expressions voice what's going
on that was exceptional too look at how
we use the
[Applause]
lights go frame by frame there yeah
awesome stuff and it's interesting how
all the scenes are so similar and I'm
curious if this is going to play into
the storyline I know League of Legends
doesn't have like tons of cut scenes
like Final Fantasy but um you know they
do have like lore for each of the
characters right so this will probably
be just a cut scene that exists outside
of the
game
so what's interesting here is he kind of
becomes like a beast himself to fight
this animal this this
monster I love that shot that's what I
want to talk about so yeah when he
smacks that thing out of the way what I
like about this is he's actually scarier
than the like big bear magic creature
that's attacking he looks actually
insane you know
um but what's interesting is he seems to
be losing himself and again I don't know
the lore here but what I get from it is
you know you have this moment where he
is essentially having to tap into
powers like he's becoming like the the
monster that he's fighting you know he's
started losing himself and then at the
end his Ally shows up
it's like wait what and look at the
light comes with
it so awesome
man and it's great because we have this
s arousing feeling the music all of a
sudden at the end when the Ally shows
up and then he doesn't have to lose
himself anym so again I don't know the
exact lower of his power up there but to
me it's like okay he's able to because
his friend helped him out not have to go
to such Dark Places to win which is
really
nice so
cool yeah and then we get the sort of
again sort of visual language that we've
established in this this sort of Arrow
of Light shooting through the camera
happen in the transition before this
scene as well and then we
come to the title title card
beautiful yeah beautifully done um some
really fantastic ideas in here visual
language is on point we have several
different scenes happening uh this one
shot might be my favorite though yeah
this one where she just explodes and
what's crazy here is this
like Sylvanas anyone
Sylvanas why is Sylvanas in League of
Legends what
they see I mean it's the same exact
power right doesn't make any sense so
yeah that's my thoughts on it but
