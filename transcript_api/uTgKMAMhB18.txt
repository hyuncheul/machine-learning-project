all YouTube what's up it's your boy
toxic B again I brought Blitz crank as a
support today instead of zerath cuz I've
been hearing some bad stuff about my
players Lately from all my friends and
families they've been telling me they've
been roasting me how bad I was and like
you know I was like I changed my support
character I try to do this instead I
hope you all have a good time watching
this
yeah so just like last time all I'm
going to be doing today is going to be
just you know doing some self- revs
basically I'll be doing some selfes to
see how I can do better and like to see
which areas that I could improve and
everything I hope I could do better with
this one but let's see how it
goes yeah I heard some of my friends
that uh support need to stay you know in
front of in case something happen but uh
I'm not too sure cuz like no one really
ever taught me how to play a league
before so I'm just trying to learn on my
own so you know feel free to give me
some critiques and uh tell me which
areas that I could
improve First
Blood
yeah that's small fight right now I
don't think it was too bad to be honest
I think I did a pretty good job you know
I made all my opponents use all their
flashes even though I still use mine too
but you know it's two against one it's
not that bad right
that one too like I kind of predicted
his movement I'm joken like you already
know like he's only going to do like one
straight move down like without doing
all those weird movements and everything
so it's pretty easy to like guess where
he would be actually like U moving
around and everything and twitch right
here too trying to like give him some
hard time as possible so that he won't
get those minions you
know
yeah you know what I realized like my K
is like pretty on spot though but like
what I realized is it's not really me
it's the ADC it's my ADC Milla like
she's actually pretty good like whoever
the whoever's doing that champion right
now I don't think he should be an iron
foral I think he's going to be like at
least like bronze 2 like a lot of you
might say like that's not a big
difference everything but if you come uh
you know stand on my shoes you'll
understand like a iron four and a bronze
four is like a big
difference
yeah and I also realized a lot of times
that they don't
really um know that I could actually use
my Q SK from behind the wall right there
so they really check like where I am so
it's pretty easy to use IQ and like
bring him over to the other side of the
wall right here so that was like a
pretty easy kill for us for the both of
us right
there and this one's like the reason it
didn't go was cuz like that was like way
too uh too many minions out there right
that's going to that's going to give us
like at least like like how many minions
are there like there's like top 10 of
them right so it's like like $200 right
there right so it's
pretty that I we couldn't you know I
could get all
the uh monies and all the uh XPS from
all those Min but thankfully you know my
ADC did not die so that was worth it I
died for the um I died for the other
two
like come on like why is he here
like like why is he here isn't he like a
top Champion like why'd he come all the
way to the bot like come on what's going
on I did my best to save her though like
I haven't like used my C kill to you
know make him go apart from neilo
but unfortunate
now
yeah for this one too a lot of you might
say like it in it and all but I kind of
realized that twitch kind of moved
downwards like whenever I use my sh so I
did do that in purpose I kind of you
know shot it downwards just so that I
could try to you know get him but yeah
it was like a pretty good shot right
there
and you know whenever U there's like a
small fight going on it's always good so
you don't go H right away that was like
a small cheap shot that I thought I
needed to do but I needed to go closer
though that was like a small
game yeah it also might be me but also
might be my adcs difference right like
this in my old game like I've been doing
a lot of stupid things and I've been
down a lot of times but I think my Blitz
crank is better than me playing Z for
sure
though maybe CU it has like a 100%
initiating skill un like zerra where
where it could just like stun him but
you know how Blitz CR could actually
like bring the champion over here to to
our area where everyone's like all
gathered around so think that might be
one
and then as a support I always do try to
you know Ward all the areas as as much
as possible just in case like all the um
opponent comes over you know we don't
want that to happen cuz's you know in
pretty good shape right now we don't
want her to lose all her money because
because you know we forget to Wards on
some areas right that's not a good
thing 100% that's not me that's just n's
pretty good at it like look how look how
aggressive she
is You Know M respect to n you know
she's been uh she's been doing a really
good job till now I think she's she's
way better than um my Cent form so you
know it's back to that OG right
there God it's always the balling like
why why is everyone coming down to the
ball Lane like you know our mid you know
opponent's top Lanes you know like
they're all coming to the mid lane like
what's going on like why are they all
like why they why are they all here so
weird oh that was a pretty good
uh
well the moment um our opponent Wasing
the top and bottom strap so that avoid
all the other damages
too I think it's just R team pretty
good point they're all really good I
like it that's like a easy wi right
there now what do you
think
yeah where' that guy come
from yeah where' he come from out of
nowhere he just uses all all the way to
the bot Lane oh my
God that's just
crazy that's just unfair what's going on
come
on
yeah thankfully we saved our um middle
turr right there the middle
Tower like that one really important
right thankfully we saved it up
though
yeah not I going to lie as an ADC player
as well as a you know six player too I
hate it whenever I I I have to step on
UMO you know those bomb shells right
there the mus bomb like it's too hard
for all the ADC survive with all those
bombs right there not
so I don't really um I feel I just feel
bad for twitch cuz like it's not really
his fault right like it's kind of hard
to like survive with all those um
mushroom boms all around
you yeah I really like the skills of the
um bloodz crank cuz like especially like
you know Q I could drag someone into our
lane and then E I could just like you
know push them up to the top and then
the alt you know it just makes everyone
just like um it makes them stun for like
a moment like they won't be able to use
any of their skills or nothing right so
that's like a pretty good skill like if
I use a Q and um all right away L they
got
nothing
yeah that was like a little bit of
mistake I wasn't really trying to grab
uh M but it's a bit too big you know
fight's too big right
there like that was meant
[Music]
to
Chet
yeah what do I think I think my two Ste
like pretty on point today
yeah like a lot of like it's like I feel
like it's like I got like 80% you know
match rate right there you
know like my K skills like gone pretty
good
lately this is kind of scary though this
guy won't even let me to run away right
there so I have to flash all you
know I have to flash you know get eight
one so that we could jump
around
[Music]
foreign
once again I know I should not have um
grab M A tanker but he's way too big I
know it's m call but I shouldn't have
done I should have a little bit more
cautious but it
happens
but once again I do know my on point but
at the same time I got to respect that
it's not me that's doing all the gam
right now it's all my teammates cuz is
so good I don't know why we B all cuz
I'm right
now look at
that I feel like all our teams were a
little bit excited CU we were hoping
that we could finish the game right
there
you know what I real recording this it
actually would have been more fun if I
actually really did like a live stream
and you guys would come and talk to my
comment section and we could actually
talk together cuz like just like talking
all it's kind of boring though like I
really I do like talking to people so it
might be really fun if you guys all just
came over to all my you
know communicate with it that actually
might be so
fun so if you guys really want that to
happen like please subscribe to my video
and please like my video and you know
share to your friends and everything I
really appreciate all your work for that
and I'll try to keep up with all my work
too I realize I like BL crank more than
a because you know blz crank is like
semi tank too right so like the really
die that e while as um D he's so weak
he's like after like two damage F he's
going to be dead but look at him this BL
TR just won't die this guy's just like
too tanky right there are you
feeling like if I was Jus right there
like I would have been dead straight up
right
now now that's a
GG
