been talking about and with good reason
two teams of Strong pedigree rich and
Talent on the cusp of going head-to-head
in a highly significant confrontation
with so much to play for how will it pan
out stay tuned we'll have all the action
for you live from London here on EA
[Music]
TV welcome our venue for this game is
the Emirates Stadium in North London I'm
Derek Ray and sitting next to me with
his tactics charts at the ready is
Stuart Robson and very much looking
forward to bringing you action from the
Premier League it's Arsenal up against
Crystal Palace thanks Derek well both
managers will be reminding their players
of starting the game quickly pinning the
opposition back playing the ball forward
and regaining possession as quickly as
possible hopefully we get a really good
game
here and so they stting 11 for Arsenal
Martin erigor plays alongside Delan rice
in central Midfield and the focal point
in attack is Gabrielle
Jesus well this is the team Crystal
palas have picked well it's a back four
a narrow Midfield three and a very
disconnected front three but if the
Midfield players give good support to
the central Striker this 4-33 system
could work really well today oh big
chance here goal in the early stages
precisely what they had been
planning well I have to say he's done
really well here he's in the right place
and then a decent finish that's a good
goal
well just look at his reaction that
could prove to be a massive goal for his
team back underway and one nil it is
let's see what happens
next Kai
havitz Martin
erard
white
Gabrielle
Gabrielle
Martinelli Gabrielle
Jesus
Martinelli throw into Arsenal coming
up possibilities inside the box and tidy
defensive
[Applause]
play Jefferson left
Ma and LMA possession is the watch word
inside their own
territory and very deafly cut
out he's in control of the
[Applause]
situation chance to play it in
rice good idea
[Applause]
up can they Square the game and it's
gone in beyond the goalkeeper Arsenal
level well here we can see it again and
no wonder the manager is furious they
just have to get tighter here deal with
the danger otherwise that's the outcome
not good enough
[Applause]
defensively well disappointment anger
frustration whatever is going through
his mind he needs to get his team going
again
here odard
e and Hughes has
it
aayu good patient buildup as they try to
Fashion
something went in strongly to win the
ball can he finish and the goalkeeper
has outdone himself with that
[Applause]
save
now sending it in is he going to
score oh a brilliantly Time Tackle when
it really
[Applause]
mattered Will Hughes well as you can
hear the fans think that should have
been a penalty but I'm not
convinced for more on the injury let's
go down to our reporter Jeff shes it's
going to take us a while to see how bad
this injury is because he got trodden on
in that last challenge so his foot is
definitely a bit sore cheers
Jeff well not giving him any Breathing
Room Arsenal have it
back options in the
center opportunity here that is how to
keep it out of the net and Arsenal have
won the corner as they try to take the
lead
can someone get on the end of this and
he clears the
danger he read the situation defensively
and did his
job and we will have just one additional
minute
aayu difficult to stop
him
so halime that will close the book on
the first half here at
the and so the second half gets underway
almost a case of the two teams saying to
each other whatever you can do I can do
just as
well a credit to him for the challenge
and a throw in conceded
so a Personnel change
then Tyreek
Mitchell Mark
GUI
scho and edir with
it now relying very much on their
passing game in a bid to take the lead
[Applause]

one now breaking at PACE is always a
possibility can he give them the
advantage and that was goalkeeping right
out of the top draw it's absolutely
remarkable his reflexes were brilliant
there
but he's gone short with
it
belli and playing it
back and cleared
away Ben

Defending to stop
