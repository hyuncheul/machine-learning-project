for
a crucial day stands in front of them
the knowledge that a win is required to
make it through to the promotion match
and no doubt about it their opponents
won't be of a mind to do them any favors
at all
[Applause]
we're live on EA
[Applause]
TV and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be olling my name
is Derek Ray positioned here on the
commentary Gantry and sitting next to me
ready to give you all the analysis is
Stuart Robson and the Chance is on for
them to reserve for themselves a
promotion match Place Stuart how do you
see this one going well Derek I think
this will be tense but they know a good
performance and a victory will give them
access to a promotion match it should be
an interesting
game really getting stuck
[Applause]
in
Franklin we're using the space really
well but now can they push on and the
referee has a warded a corner following
that
touch can he deliver it with
[Applause]
accuracy an ordinary header and that's
probably probably being
[Applause]
charitable well a very important record
broken last time out you're looking at
the club's new all-time top scorer yeah
what a great achievement but she won't
want to stop and a foul in the opinion
of the referee now what can they do from
this free kick
[Applause]
situation didn't have the trajectory
necessary to get it beyond the
wall and the corner kick the referee's
verdict let's see about the
[Applause]
delivery vital
intervention they've regain
possession Franklin
could cross it in
here well there's a really stylish piece
of running angles it
back and the danger is
[Applause]
averted
[Applause]
mati
Franklin who can he pick
[Applause]
out a chance perhaps and the penalty has
been given
here well no card handed out but quite a
few upset players out there Stuart well
he's made a genuine attempt to play the
ball so penalty yes yellow card
no and the spot kick is converted as
coldly as you
like well here it is again great
composure to send the keeper the wrong
way before striking it into the opposite
side that's an excellent
penalty and the ball is moving once more
how important will that opening goal
proved to
[Applause]
be effective
[Applause]
challenge is this the moment and that
for grabs off the keeper and the keeper
really reacted brilliantly well from
that sort of range it's a great save I
have to say
[Applause]
say can someone get on the end of this
now the corner too close to the
goalkeeper that
time and given away by The
Lads well go kick just as it was looking
[Applause]
promising
oil Reed and in the right position to
read
[Applause]
it and moving the ball forward with
genuine purpose here but nothing comes
of it good defending it
was and just unable to keep it in play
in the end it'll be a throw
[Applause]
in
[Applause]
Franklin franking at
PACE this could Square the game and
still an
opportunity and well position to
clear
L to the
[Applause]
Box danger a it for
now well the visitors very much
dictating the tempo over the last 15
minutes or so and they play some good
football it's just now about taking one
of those chances to get back into the
[Applause]
game
excellent
defending and played
in and cleared
[Applause]
away and on the back of that particular
challenge will the referee let the
matter rest
[Applause]
there
[Applause]
getting
forward good looking
cross just wanted to get it out of
there the textbook
[Applause]
interception oh cut out straight
away
and they bought themselves a bit of time
and the verdict of the officials is
offside well he just gets caught ball
watching here needs to be more alive
work harder to keep on site and be ready
for the
chance well as you can hear the fans
think that should have been a penalty
but I'm not
[Applause]
convinced oh nice ball chance to finish
well what a stomp it was well I have to
say that's a magnificent save that's a
top class piece of
[Applause]
goalkeeping but he's gone short with
it that's a nice looking
ball well four marks to him for that
header but the goalkeeper did his
job two minutes of stoppage time coming
up and a throw coming up after that
authoritative
challenge
and with that the first half draws to a
[Applause]
close
get
[Applause]
well they've got things going again here
and I wonder what kind of second half we
have in store for
us great ball over the top he's in
here oh he's missed but by a minuscule
margin well he couldn't have made better
contact than that his technique is
brilliant he's so unlucky
there
H
[Applause]
Alex nef Now options are
plenty cross could be useful but he
dealt with that ball played in rather
[Applause]
well not the best Challenge free
[Applause]
kick could play it
in able to clear the danger at least for
[Applause]
now
and back with
K well good run this now what can he do
with
[Applause]
it mati and Crossing towards the far
post oh must be and there it is a two
goal cushion now and they just need to
keep the
concentration
hero Jong and a tiny challenge superb
looking pass timely intervention well he
wasn't messing around with the
clearance
an encouraging move from madlads
Crossing into the
middle and a goal this time applying the
Finishing Touch just what the doctor
order well nicely cut
out and slipped through
[Applause]
beautifully
Jong and here now is Hernandez nicely
timed
[Applause]
tackle
[Applause]
Franklin onto
Hernandez well it's the Mad lad's turn
now
really fine piece of Defending play to
break us up racing forward trying to
catch them
[Applause]
out cross towards that far post danger
still
[Applause]
on
J now they have possession in a good
area of the
[Applause]
pitch Reed
now must be it's gone in and well he
might celebrate on the back of
[Applause]
that mati
and playing it to the
goalkeeper
Alex how can he take them on and beat
them body in the
[Applause]
way
Özil Campbell with
[Applause]
it well it did look promising but no
threat in the
[Applause]
end oh she's broken things up
[Applause]
magnificently now we're inside the final
10 minutes in this
one and a timely
intervention
well the final whistle almost upon us
and this is not going to be an away away
day that lives long in the memory Stuart
give us your take well there's been a
real lack of energy right from the start
of the game certainly when they haven't
had the ball they're closing down
decision making and Recovery runs just
haven't been good
enough Top Class
defending real chance and Under Pressure
that was a fine
claim
onto
Hernandez and that's an important
[Applause]
intervention oh what a top notch
[Applause]
pass it's got to be stopped a sh fire
goal well he knew what he was doing
defensively with the concession of that
throwing it's looking
[Applause]
promising well the cross goes in but
there's no one available to snap onto
it there is going to be stoppage time
but only the one
[Applause]
minute possibilities Inside the Box well
that was incisive and a fine cross well
still an issue here
and that is going to be that well a tale
of Woe in terms of the score line as far
as the visitors
are possession they created better
chances and they were the more dominant
side but that counts for
nothing
there's more tension in the air than
usual and you can understand why if they
get the victory today they'll be assured
of a place in the promotion match and
that is nothing to be sniffed
[Applause]
at we'll have the action on EA
[Music]
[Applause]
TV and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be enrolling my
name is Derek Ray and sitting next to me
here on the commentary Gantry is the
former Arsenal and West Ham United
midfield man Stuart Robson and if things
go well for them they can qualify for a
promotion match what do you anticipate
seeing Stuart well Derek a win here and
they will get themselves a promotion
match they just need to keep their nerve
and put in a decent
performance d looking through ball and
the keeper really reacted brilliantly
well from that sort of range it's a
great save I have to
[Applause]
say and he's fired over the corner now
it's off Target they were watching him
like a
[Applause]
hawk Reed now
R it superbly to take back
possession oh the crossbar is still
reverberating well threat over for now
promising looking
ball a decisive clearance it
[Applause]
was
and the Mad Lads unable to retain
possession Reed
[Applause]
now looking towards the back post not
all that convincing
defensively spot on with that
tackle
well that's wonderful attacking play but
no damage done that's the main
thing and they'll get ready for the
throw
[Applause]
in well gifting away
possession
excellent ball over the top took a
really smart piece of Defending to stop
[Applause]
[Applause]
them
[Applause]
mati promising move from
madlads and still dangerous
that's a good
ball oh last ditch defending at its very
finest oh she's made a crucial tackle
there well that ball looks
promising chance to play it in and the
post denied him taking care of business
defensively
[Applause]
here well they they won't come closer
than that but they are creating chances
and surely a goal is coming yes a really
open flow to the game end to endend
stuff
[Applause]
Jong
Özil and offside just as he was ready to
pounce trying to open them
up
oh chance perhaps great defending
here making sure nothing on to happened
superb
tackle
[Applause]
Jong and that puts him in
position no high quality defending No
Nonsense clearance
well as you can see it's been all mad
Lads over the last 15 minutes and
they're playing really well and creating
chances but surely only a matter of time
before they take the lead
here yes it might be on for them once
more a chance to whip it
in was it a great
[Applause]
clearance well there was impending
danger but good defending
[Applause]
now play stopped it is a free
kick and in the right position to read
it so deflection and it will be be a
throw
in now madlads moving the ball forward
what can they do with
[Applause]
it and in the right position to make
sure it didn't go all the way
through and and doubled up with ease by
the
keeper and here now is
Hernandez that's a good looking
ball can he put them in front oh no he's
missed the opportunity and they remain
level well he just lacked composure
there didn't he they should be ahead
[Applause]
now
Walker well the lads being afforded too
much
room
and did just enough
defensively did well to win the ball
back a chance then for the respective
managers to address their charges it is
half time
[Applause]
here
[Applause]
like
well as they get the ball rolling again
interesting to see how this second half
pans
[Applause]
out and there it breaks down but credit
to the
defense
[Applause]
Walker and the pass not finding its
Target plenty of support here wonderful
chance and there it is but hang on the
flag has gone up and it's not going to
count well it was a close call but he is
just offside good finish mind you
well read to win possession
[Applause]
[Music]
back who is
[Music]
[Applause]
he here's
Hernandez well it's a goodl looking
position is there a goal in the
future
and there to
intervene Franklin since they have the
ball a referee playing Advantage
here Walker
now
mati
Walker Franklin and a chance to whip it
in here oh thwart it there and what a
piece of Defending we've just
witnessed deserves credit for winning
the ball
back a chopping Challenge and the
referee has got to have a big think
about
[Applause]
it
[Applause]
cross could be
useful another a time for
coolheads
Walker
Franklin and a good mad lad's move in
the
making a good and fair
[Applause]
challenge when the referee Blows the
Whistle it is a free
[Applause]
kick so a throw in
[Applause]
here that was a menacing attack but
tidied
[Applause]
up tremendous intuition to win it
back
the owner of the
R so much space for Mad Lads out
[Applause]
wide and the cross comes to
[Applause]
nothing sound piece of
[Applause]
goalkeeping Reed now and they have
possession
again
and a long way out here well it wasn't
quite as dangerous as I thought it might
[Applause]
be well the stats tell you everything
their finishing just hasn't been good
enough they've controlled much of the
game but they need to start taking some
of these
[Applause]
opportunities is this the moment and
there it is the dead Lock has been
broken we wondered if a goal would
arrive well now it has and will there be
a respon B
now and seted
[Applause]
it he has time to play it over plattered
away well a disappointing throw there
[Applause]
well they'll be looking to add to their
advantage from this
[Applause]
corner over it
comes
and a throw in
[Applause]
forthcoming options in the
[Applause]
center and a throw coming up after that
authoritative
[Applause]
challenge
very quick thinking
[Applause]
there 5 minutes remaining and one thing
is certain no one is leaving because
it's still
[Applause]
close the cross is on well they're going
to be very cross with themselves because
that was a wasted
opportunity well just listen to the
noise in here these fans are doing
everything to get their team over the
finish line and there's not long left
[Applause]
now well they're attacking but time is
the great enemy ohia well that's not one
that's going to lingo long in the memory
well he had a go there nothing wrong
with that but he's got that all
wrong and the danger
cleared
well the referee has instructed the
fourth official to put two minutes on
the
board
Walker well good run this now what can
he do with
it opportunity and the keeper and pushed
onto the
woodwork and there it is the final
whistle and the fans will be
