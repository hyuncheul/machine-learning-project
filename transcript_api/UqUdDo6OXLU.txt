all eyes on one man well Derek we know
he loves linking up with other players
but it's when he's in and around the
penalty area that's when he's at his
most dangerous when he plays little one
twos around his marker and then plays
the next forward pass into a runner he
could be the key to unlocking this
defense action coming up
line
[Applause]
good evening and welcome ahead of what
should be a pulsating night of football
I'm Derek Ray in the commentary position
and alongside me is the former Arsenal
and West Ham Midfield player Stuart
Robson and the stage is set for club's
match action how do you see the match
going Stuart yes thanks as always Derek
we've got two good teams here so I'm
anticipating a really good game the
atmosphere is electric inside the
stadium before kickoff and hopefully
we're not disappointed
Hatton
Antonio
antoan
rainy well they've given him too much
space attending to his defensive
chores
and back with
fera now he must favor the
cross and thumped
away
fera
couldn't keep the
ball and after that fantastic effort
it's gone out for a throw
in well what on Earth happened
there
now do they mean business on this
occasion and playing it through but how
well he did to react in that
manner already closing him down
here it is to be a throw in
[Applause]
a very timely
interception opportunity and both hands
on it good
[Applause]
goalkeeping
try to really get at the opposition
here but they dealt with the threat
posed and it cross the touch line so a
throw in
[Applause]
here effective
[Applause]
challenge opportunity to deliver the
cross
[Applause]
he'll be delighted to have won the ball
having made that difficult
challenge oh moving it
[Applause]
nicely lost
[Applause]
possession
had a chance to whip it in
here well nothing comes of it referee
indicates goal
[Applause]
kick wanted to keep it but
[Applause]
couldn't sh going real patience can they
Forge ahead and an opportunity here for
them to get their noses in front from
the corner well they've been frustrated
for quite a while now but these fans
have suddenly come to
life well no let up plenty of
pressure continues his run and let's
give credit to the
defending
[Applause]
fera delivered into the box and still
dangerous well nothing comes of
it
Honan
rainy and intercepts
again can they trouble the opposition
this
time electing to shoot great defending
here and a fine
cross and the danger
[Applause]
cleared oh he looks threatening and
putting his body on the
line well there was impending danger but
good defense
[Applause]
rainy
Pon
Antonia oh great
vision useful cross towards veneer post
but it wasn't quite as good as it looked
when it was played
over
a bit of Running Room now on the wing oh
what an
opportunity well a vital interception to
Snuff out the
danger and the whistle is sounded for
halime in this
[Applause]
game
I
and so the second half gets underway
almost a case of the two teams saying to
each other whatever you can do I can do
just as
[Applause]
well tremendous intuition to win it
back
[Applause]
[Applause]
madowski
decent looking
pass and space here on the
flank magnificent challenge to win it
[Applause]
back antoan that's a good
[Applause]
ball clear to see who got the last touch
so a throw in it'll
[Applause]
be sloppy in
possession
[Applause]
Andrew dangerous looking through ball
it's a neat
move superbly read and
executed oh that's a fine
pass and quick thinking
defensively can he play it
in being egged on by the crowd well what
a stop that
[Applause]
was and short it is play towards the
back post the cross played over and work
to do
defensively being pressed
here
pon
[Applause]
Onan well moving the ball forward they
might be in business and the referee
blows for a
[Applause]
foul
and Crossing towards the far post what a
lovely strike lethal piece of finishing
drilled home with true conviction
tremendous
goal well here's the replay and what a
well delivered cross this is perfectly
placed and the Finish is just as good
that's an excellent goal released it
nicely now they have possession in a
good area of the
pitch oh nice ball over the
top and defensive play to be
[Applause]
applauded plenty of support here and
let's give credit to the
[Applause]
defending
[Applause]
the defender doing his
job clearly took a touch on the way out
of play so a throw in to
come into the advanced
position he's lost
it will he play it
[Music]
in the
delivery huge block
trailing as they are they must make good
use of this
corner well the crowd are doing their
bit can they find The Equalizer
here and the header just clearing the
crossbar well I think he'd be slightly
disappointed because once he gets to it
first that's a
chance
Antonio
[Applause]
Rainey not the best Challenge free
[Applause]
kick a quarter of an hour remaining
here not an easy ball to trap in all
[Applause]
fairness
and that is going to be a free
kick and it's whipped in
early still possibilities and the keeper
has it after that tension Laden sequence
well what a great first save that was
how did he stop
that perfect
tackle
creative look about this but the danger
averted for
now and threading it through well not to
be he had moved into an illegal position
well it's great that he wants to run in
behind but he has to get the timing
right that's a good
[Applause]
ball just couldn't get it through
[Applause]
[Music]
well there's still scope for late drama
here five minutes left and just one goal
between the
sides
rainy might be able to get in behind the
[Applause]
defense well disappointing end to the
move well the the fans are certainly
playing their part here just listen to
this
noise good play it in oh thwarted there
and what a piece of Defending we've just
witnessed we've had the official word
there will be a minimum of two added
minutes
Antonio
went in strongly
decisively and so the referee blows for
full time and it goes
[Applause]
down deserve their
[Applause]
victory
yeah
it is a day of real residence and
significance what an opportunity a
chance to win promotion and they have it
in their own hands win the game and
right you
history complete coverage is next on EA
TV one of the great things about
football is that no one knows for sure
what's going to happen let's see what
unfolds here tonight I'm Derek Ray and
my commentary partner here on the Gantry
is the former Arsenal and West Ham
player Stuart Robson and if they play
their cards right today they'll be
celebrating promotion how do you see the
match going Stuart well this could be
edgy it could be nervy it could be
exciting but what we do know if they get
a win here today they will be promoted
it's a massive game for
them cross fired over now nothing comes
of
[Applause]
it clear foul play and as a result a
free kick
forthcoming could be
dangerous and a goal that is a very
bright start perfect way to
open so underway again here 1 n to
score
Onan
Antonio face afforded him but nothing
comes of
it plenty of support
[Applause]
here now who can she pass it
[Applause]
to well there was impending danger but
good
defending
antoan they need to get tighter have to
say a poor touch unable to keep it in
play goal
kick
Kaa dragovich
chance to play it in using all his
defensive Acumen to cut it
out creative look about
[Applause]
this
Antonio decent looking
pass very alert defending to put a stop
to the chance
Hatton not smooth in
possession Well that took
confidence since they have the could be
well not to be for her in front of goal
well that's a poor Miss in what was a
great situation it's still in the
balance
here
[Music]
Antonio this looks promising now
delivering that deep cross and still
danger
here it was an attack of promise but
they couldn't take advantage of the
situation
Advantage
played well no advantage in the end and
she'll pull it back for the free
kick he'll be breathing a sigh of relief
ball
one
into the advanced
position and the referee has given the
corner so maybe scope here for them to
add to their
lead they're going for the short
one the deliver
could still be
dangerous well they can keep possession
of it now not giving him a moment's
piece and a strong tackle and scope for
them to produce something exciting and
it's opening up oh that surely had to go
in but marvelous
[Applause]
defending and losing possession
[Applause]
and a very good
challenge the high press was very much
on they might be able to get in
[Applause]
now
and they'll be happy to have regained
possession and support
available well a top-notch piece of
defensive
judgment and a throw in it's going to
be let's just clarify the injury
situation our man on the side of the
pitch is Jeff shares he's moving quite
gingely because his foot is sore cuz he
got trodden on in that last challenge
here's
Jeff can they trouble the opposition
this
time well didn't go to plan in the
[Applause]
end so almost at the break here and not
quite going to plan for the homeside
work to do Stewart well I've been a
little disappointed with their attacking
play it's all been a bit too slow if
they can pass into their front areas
with more quality switch play quicker
and be more positive in 1 V situations I
think they'll get back into
this
[Applause]
rainy and that is going to be all for
the first 45 then here at the atad
stadium
the
[Music]
[Applause]
well they've got things going again here
and I wonder what kind of second half we
have in store for
[Applause]
us
[Applause]
well a really good run but nothing comes
of
it now can she get on the end of this
[Applause]
one oh great
[Applause]
defending
one and given
away skipping
away moving the ball forward with
purpose but they took care of the
situation defensively oh lovely weighted
ball they might be in and he's
in oh that's textbook
goalkeeping and smuggled behind for the
corner
[Applause]
he's driven in the corner just far too
close to the
goalkeeper
Antonio
Onan nicely cut
out
it might be on for
them oh breezing past him in
[Applause]
position went in strongly to win the
ball and space to cross
it and that is defending of the highest
order so a throw in
here
and quick thinking
[Applause]
defensively now we're into the final
half
hour fail to keep hold of
it room to maneuver on the
wing as you can see the visitors have
had much less of the ball but what
they've done with it has been really
good and they'll be happy with the way
the game is being played moment they
love to play on the
Counterattack
K The Defenders know you can't really
allow space like
that Andrew Vance that's Andrew Vance
please meet your wife at the steps of
the main stand thank
you a creative look about
this
[Applause]
Ru has
it beautiful pass and the ruling is
offside
here
haton and offside
unfortunately
and into the last 20
minutes just trying to keep their
opponents on their toes with the passing
game really good buildup but no end
product well these fans are right behind
the team here can they get the equalizer
though oh nice
ball Crossing into the middle
[Applause]
and he read it well
defensively strong play here well the
referee not too happy with the challenge
and blows for a free
kick
dragovic
[Applause]
well read to put an end to that attack
this had to look a bit Lively given the
pressure that easily cut out in the
end good looking
sequence and out for a throw in just
misfiring with the pass
well just listen to this crowd they want
a bit more they know there's still
plenty of time to find an equalizer
surely they get another chance maybe
[Applause]
two high quality
[Applause]
defending could cross it in
[Applause]
here in a decent position now it should
be still could be
dangerous danger averted for
now well they couldn't keep
[Applause]
possession I think you've got to
conclude that was good refereeing a free
kick in the end after initially playing
Advantage but it just wasn't
[Applause]
there and now Ru has
[Applause]
it the referee has decided there will be
just one minute of added
time
and there it is the final whistle not
what the home fans were hoping for
before a ball was kicked today defeat
for them well Derek it was a poor result
but it was a really tight contest both
sides had their chances could have gone
either way but in the end they will be
disappointed
the prize today is considerable win the
game and make it through to the
promotion match a big test of every
player's
character the game is live in its
entirety only on eatv
next good evening and welcome ahead of
what should be a pulsating night of
football I'm Derek Ray and I'm joined
here on the gantry for commentary by
Stuart Robson and if all goes to plan
they can progress to a promotion match
Stuarts what are you expecting well
Derek it's certainly in their hands if
they win here a promotion match will be
theirs they just need to put in a good
performance it won't be easy
though quite simply the course was too
close to the
keeper
rainy well not quite what he wanted to
do with the
[Applause]
pass
Antonio and they'll get ready for the
throw
[Applause]
in superb defensive judgment to end the
attack
back an example of how to
[Applause]
press
vinc well no stopping
him effective Challenge and room now out
on the
wing options in the
middle making sure nothing came of it
[Applause]
he's very Adept at protecting the
ball and the defensive intervention
there it's got to be and there it is 1 n
their efforts have been rewarded and
look at the
[Applause]
[Music]
celebrations so the match has restarted
1 n
[Applause]
here
Antonio and that's an important
intervention
[Applause]
Antonio this could Square the game and
that's exactly what has transpired now
that could be a massive turning point
and momentum is with
them well here it is again he hits this
so sweetly doesn't he that's a brilliant
goal from a top class
player vinc
[Applause]
ibraim
Shaw he saw the situation
[Applause]
developing
[Applause]
Antonio IL
[Music]
intercepted well he didn't missed by an
awful
[Applause]
lot definitely look as though they want
to make this move
count sound piece of
goalkeeping
that's a good pass this looks
interesting and an opportunity here for
them to get their noses in front from
the
corner can he deliver it with accuracy
oh tremendous header that time but the
goalkeeper was there that increasing the
pressure another corner it
[Applause]
is and just wide there really wasn't
much in that at
[Applause]
all
Antonio looking for the final pass that
will open things
up well they were very patient but they
no longer have the
ball over the touch line for a throw
in
targets available cross comes in and
still
dangerous well how about that for a
piece of tackling to break things
[Applause]
up duu not giving him a moment's
pece space on the
flank
[Applause]
[Music]
Antonio
rainy untiy on the
ball that's a good looking ball oh
tremendous goalkeeping offside not that
anyone knew
[Applause]
Onan that's a lovely
ball and the cross goes in able to deal
with the
[Applause]
threat and there's the
delivery miles off Target with that
particular header well the defender did
just about enough there a difficult
chance in the end I would say not the
most confident
clearance and it took a little Nick
before it went over the touch line so a
throw in here putting so much effort
into winning back
possession the referee spotted the
little Nick on the way through so a
throw in coming
[Applause]
up
now doesn't get away with it free kick
given the referee has decided there will
be just one minute of added
[Applause]
time
[Applause]
and the halftime whistle is sounded that
is going to be all for the first
[Applause]
[Applause]
45
[Applause]
so the two teams have switched around
and the second half is
underway
simply couldn't beat the first
Defender intercepting it
intelligently Crossing opportunity can
they slot it home very clear who got the
last touch so a corner coming up well
just listen to these fans they're urging
their team to score here and take the
[Applause]
lead and passing it's
through oh really commanding
[Applause]
goalkeeping and over it comes just two
much height on that one close shave
[Applause]
though
[Applause]
ibraim now the outcome is a free kick
here well no stopping him well didn't go
to plan in the
end
[Applause]
and a chance for him on the
flank now let's see about the cross well
he failed to get it away
properly flag rayed for
[Applause]
offside
[Applause]
ibraim
Kimura L into the center oh great header
Smart Stop
[Applause]
though
rainy we're into the final half
[Applause]
[Music]
hour plenty of players waiting in the
middle what a a genuine opportunity but
it was squandered go
[Applause]
kick
[Applause]
Hatton oh he's given the ball away
and the counter looks on here options
available frustration for those waiting
in the Middle with the game level let's
see what they can do with this
corner who can they pick
out oh fantastic effort he made great
contact but the keeper more than equal
to
it
Antonio
well the keeper had plenty to think
about with bodies around
him well it wasn't first class
[Applause]
distribution we have 20 minutes left in
this game and a chance to whip it in
here and a significant block following
that
[Applause]
cross Ball's
gone nice looking
pass and a go it is to put them in front
again no less than they
deserve
well the dramatic moment near the end
and that might well be the
decid
Onan rainy now let's see what they can
do here promising pass oh might be oh
that is a majestic goal Voli home with
precision and style super superly
done and it cross the touch line so a
throw in
[Applause]
here just the clearance that was called
[Applause]
for really good
challenge space afforded him another
certainly thinking about a winner that
deep delivery and still danger here oh
can you believe it with so little time
left surely that will be the winner
amazing scenes
here what a big moment in the dying
Embers will it prove decisive
here
Antonio it's a Well struck pass late in
the game here and they know what they've
got to do using his body to good effect
[Applause]
difficult to stop
him dangerous ball he succeeds in
clearing
[Applause]
it that's not a bad
ball oh L drama here all level again
incredible
scenes and it's level again here both
sets of fans being put through something
of an emotional
mangle rainy well you can see how
fiercely they're concentrating on
finding a
winner but the danger averted for
now that is how to apply the
pressure
[Applause]
duu well taking into account all the
stoppages two minutes to be added on

Antonio might be on to something with
that
ball good ball over the
top still trailing but they're upping
the
pressure and just like that they don't
have the ball anymore well let's see
what they have in store for them on the
break well they seem to be on to
something positive but it faded
away

of the highest class fantastic
[Applause]
technique so back underway following The
Equalizer well no more time left that
concludes the first half here in

really choose between them at the
[Applause]
moment released it nicely well an
opportunity that he couldn't take
advantage of Stewart well he did
everything right except score his
movement was really good it deserved a
goal
[Applause]
really well good run this now what can
he do with it and routine for the keeper
in the end the cross far too close to
[Applause]
him
intercepting it
intelligently
Antonio Crossing
opportunity now will they be able to
play it in behind the defense well they
were very patient but they no longer
have the
[Applause]
ball what a brilliant
[Applause]
pass delivering it into the box well
cleared
away Antonio now they're on the scent of
something positive but well it Fizzles
out thanks to that piece of
Defending a very effective play and they
might be on to something foul there free
kick
[Applause]
awarded and snuffed out the danger
immediately
[Applause]
Antonio
antoan plenty of players waiting in the
middle a very effective
[Applause]
clearance the referee's letting it go as

contest this is turning out to
[Applause]
me

find that bit of space in the box and
then he shows a lot of composure to
finish it off that's a good
goal the fans want to see a
shot oh good defending to stop a decent
looking
attack now perhaps they can counter from
[Applause]
here nice looking
pass and he read it well
[Applause]
defensively possibilities inside the box
and drawing it
back but he knew he had to get to the
ball and he
[Applause]
[Applause]
did
really important piece of last ditch
defending a foul but Advantage
[Applause]
played
[Applause]
Antonio 10 minutes left for
play well time is running out to get
this winner but the can certainly
believe it's coming just listen to the
noise what a fantastic finish we could
have
here just have to make sure they don't
get caught on the
Counterattack can they profit from this
and they're on the front foot looking
for a winner near the end of this game
not a touch off the defender last of all
so a
corner who can they pick out out good
bit of
Defending he read the situation
defensively and did his
[Applause]
job took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop them and a clear foul
but the referee letting the play
Flow and teammates around
[Applause]
him
[Applause]
he has time to play it over oh what a
clearance Under Pressure had to react
and
did oh nice ball over the top to chase
well it might still work out for
them and in the end no damage done
and there is the referee's whistle for
full time even stepen here they can't be
separated we were treated to goals and
Ste are interested to get your verdict
well Derek what a good game it was
plenty of chances some good attacking
play and a couple of outstanding
individual performances I really enjoyed
that
[Applause]
one
for
h
Famous Last Words a draw is all they
need it's true in this case a draw to
make it through to the promotion match
but can they produce the performance
they need and get over the
[Applause]
line we're live on
eatv and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be enrolling I'm
Derek Ray and adjacent to me in the
commentary box is Stuart Robson and it
all goes to PL a glorious chance oh just
wide of the mark goal kick well that
never looked like troubling the keeper
did it but it was worth an effort a good
strike from
him
antoan
[Applause]
rainy out
Schuler
rice and space to cross it well the
goalkeeper making sure he avoided a
mishap
[Applause]
and nicely over the top not the most
confident
[Applause]
clearance this looks promising from meat
and drink good through ball not really
the ideal
clearance it's there for him and the
keeper more than equal to
[Applause]
it
played
over save oh goodness me he set the post
and putting his body on the line and the
verdict of the officials is offside well
he just gets caught ball watching here
needs to be more alive work harder to
keep on site and be ready for the
chance and teammates to play it to
spot on with that tackle can he put them
in front but it was a wonderful chance
but the goalkeeper comes through yes
Derek we have to give credit to the
keeper but surely he should have scored
there that's a big big
chance must be oh blocked
it
rainy
[Applause]
Antonio high quality defending out
offside
unfortunately
[Applause]
gold
miali and credit due a good
intervention what a brilliant
pass it looks
promising sends it back crucial
intervention just then and made
impending
[Applause]
danger r with
it
gold
Fernandez
out
Schumer and passing it well it comes to
absolutely
[Applause]
nothing could play it
in well unable to bend his run
offside
here's Fernandez and a clear foul but
the referee letting the play
[Applause]
Flow teammates in the
[Applause]
middle so a throw in
here
will he play it
[Music]
[Applause]
in a very effective play and they might
be on to
something now will the cross work out
for them and No Nonsense defensive
clearance they might be able to get in
now good wait on that
pass well that's how to do it inside
your own penalty
area Hatton really nice ball well the
flag was up in good time bringing that
move to an end well he's just got to be
more patient there he's gone too
early lot to like about that pass oh how
about that for a tackle
[Applause]
it might be on for them and not cleared
away properly and holding on to it at
the second time of
asking
[Applause]
Pon and meat and drink have possession
again
that was going in will this corner bear
fruit for
[Applause]
them playing it in good bit of
[Applause]
Defending rice with it decent looking
attack from meat and drink delivering it
into the box
not the most confident
[Applause]
clearance and a fine
cross it will be a goal kick
[Applause]
here
Onan
wonderfully weighted
[Applause]
pass tremendously strong in the
tackle well they haven't created too
much lately but the fans know this is a
chance to take the lead
[Applause]
here trying to deliver it
accurately
and the ball is
loose and so the first 45 minutes have
come and gone here at the ettihad
[Applause]
[Applause]
like
well underway once more and it's going
to be fascinating to see what
developments occur in this second
[Applause]
half good
distribution interception to Snuff out
the
[Applause]
danger Al
Schuler did well to win the ball
[Applause]
back me and drink exploiting the space
on the flank can he apply the finish and
a strong glove on the ball from The
Keeper defensive Brazilians to shut them
down well that's common sense refereeing
to play
advantage
it needs an accurate
[Applause]
cross cross towards that far clst well I
suspected that might be difficult for
the keeper but I was
[Applause]
wrong a tremendous
vision and he clears the danger and the
referee blows for a
foul in a decent position
now nice looking move this foiling his
opponent
completely so a throw in
here must be can he put it away
here what a
[Applause]
block cleared away foul there free kick
awarded well we're into the final half
hour can they create something from here
well nothing comes of it it looked
[Applause]
promising
possession lost
intercepted Honan well a stylish
moment Crossing into the middle pretty
comfortable piece of
Defending a chance to nudge in front
corner kick
[Applause]
here can someone get on the end of this
appear to be in two
mins oh he's blocked
it very quick thinking
there
mikal and head
forward well he put the cross into the
right place but no one able to finish it
off and there it is the opening goal 1 n
and they'll feel they deserve
it are back underway and one n it is
let's see what happens
next really getting stuck
in 20 minutes
remaining oh what a topn
pass
oh it comes to nothing in the end really
should have made more of
[Applause]
that
antoan that's a well struck
[Applause]
pass
can he do it the save was a good
one well the crowd are doing their bit
can they find The Equalizer
here and there's the
delivery and well positioned to
clear opportunity my goodness that's
save F he stretched he was one for his
own highlights
reel now sending it in making sure
nothing came of
it well the players should be inspired
by this the crowd have really got behind
them
[Applause]
today in position and and a goal they
lead by two now and that allows them to
breathe a bit more
easily so the ball rolling again at 2-
n
[Applause]
Anan and great work to confuse the
defender
wanted to keep it but
couldn't chance maybe to use the
counterattacking ability to good
effect speculative effort here and what
a magical save it
was favoring the short
one it comes to absolutely
nothing
[Applause]
well nearly there this game almost over
and looking at the fan ster they appear
to me to be more than a bit gutted well
they've had no defensive game plan today
the forwards haven't pressed the ball
the Midfield players have been
outnumbered and there is too much space
between the Defenders at the back that's
been the
[Applause]
problem well he wasn't messing around
with the
clearance pon
totaling up all the stoppages we'll have
two additional minutes and running it
back racing forward trying to catch them
out since they have the ball the referee
playing Advantage
here and there it is the final whistle
not what the home fans are
[Applause]
H and they didn't deserve anything from
the game need a much better display next
time
[Applause]
out
now
h
I
Famous Last Words a draw is all they
need it's true in this case a draw to
make it through to the promotion match
but can they produce the performance
they need and get over the
[Applause]
line stay tuned we're live next on EA TV
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be olling my name is
Derek Ray and sitting next to me here on
the commentary Gantry is the former
Arsenal and West Ham United midfield man
Stuart Robson and if things go well for
them they can qualify for a promotion
match how do you see the match going
Stuart well I think Derek this will be T
but they know a good performance here
and and a draw at least will give them
access to a promotion match it should be
an interesting
[Applause]
game
Antonio and they have possession
[Applause]
again he's going forward well here
[Applause]
now he's given us
away
Numa and tidy defensive
play
[Applause]
rainy he could pick out a
teammate oh Sensational effort well the
audacity to attempt that it nearly paid
off it would have been a spectacular
goal aware of a threat solving the
problem really clever
pressing it has to be strong hand on
that one so a corner
[Applause]
here let's see about the
[Applause]
delivery and No Nonsense defensive
clearance well they have the ball once
more
can they trouble the opposition this
time well didn't go to plan in the
[Applause]
end concession Walker please go to the
ticket office to meet thank
you moving the ball
effectively an alert piece of Defending
[Applause]
opina so a throw in
[Applause]
[Applause]
here passing it around looking for the
goal that would put them ahead oh he
needs to clear it
here
NASA and the Krakens looking
dangerous Crossing into the middle
making sure nothing un to happened now
the teams are locked together will it
stay that way following this corner
delivering it and making sure it wasn't
[Applause]
problematic dangerous ball and there it
is the opening goal One n and they'll
feel they deserve
[Applause]
it well here's the replay and it's a
really inviting ball played into the box
begging players to to attack it and it's
a comfortable finish in the end which is
made to look so easy it's a lovely
goal Antonio plenty of forward momentum
here but can they
produce this could Square the game
brilliantly
blocked
and quick thinking
defensively
Antonio
opportunity PA is loose not trailing
here but a corner it
is over it
comes managed to get it out of
there no nonsense
[Music]
[Applause]
clearance Numa now who can she play it
to very alert defending to put a stop to
the
chance we can get more details on that
injur situation from our man pitch side
Jeff re Jeff we're going to have to wait
and see the extent of this injury
because his foot was trodden on in that
last challenge so we'll have to wait and
see as just to how serious this is
cheers
Jeff corner kick played in good piece of
Defending and the cross goes in didn't
really work the keeper when all was said
and
[Applause]
done
now Krakens with the ball
again
kers well keeping hold of the ball is
what it's all about for
them there's to win it
back and we will have just one
additional minute oh nice
[Applause]
ball halime that will do it for the
first half here at the etti
[Applause]
had
in

underway
here and the referee takes exception to
the Challenge free
[Applause]
kick
good patient build up as they try to
Fashion
[Applause]
something successfully cut
[Applause]
out not a clear foul but the referee
letting the play
Flow
determined
defending nice waight on the
pass the referee knew that was Foul Play
but Advantage it
is
Antonio
the inside route looking
promising high quality
[Applause]
defending that's very good refereeing to
let the play
Flow find work from Krakens to win the
ball
back
[Applause]
Splendid tackle and a throw in coming
up that's effect of pressure high up the
pitch oh it might be able to close down
the shot well that'll be a corner a goal
here would really change the the
complexion of this
match a glorious chance oh a save right
out of the top draw Super Stop well
thank goodness for the goalkeeper well
they're calm now but that initial save
was absolutely
[Applause]
magnificent getting forward well no
point in stopping play Advantage with
them well no advantage in the end and
she'll pull it back for the free
[Applause]
kick and No Nonsense defensive clearance
chance to finish the threat was there
but no problems now he got in the way of
that
cross
and Krakens finding space on the
wing but nothing comes of
it
rainy and the advantage acrs to the
attacking side clean
challenge decent looking
pass
superb block on the back of the ball
from the
flank
rainy well the fans believe there's hope
here can the players respond
now well that's good defending well
organized up the
[Applause]
back
[Applause]
and into the last 15 minutes of
action giving the ball
[Applause]
away trying to really get at the
opposition here and credit is due for
that good piece of
Defending might work out oh could be a
chance and a goal to square the game
head to the seat
St
Numa went in strongly to win the ball
but doesn't have to do it on his own
well they still have designs on the
win not out of the woods yet and a
confident
clearance some of the fans are screaming
have a go oh he saved it
well and there to
intervene
[Applause]
Onan a chance to whip it
[Applause]
in nicely timed tackle
and so into the final 5
minutes he'll have a go here well the
goalkeeper's life wasn't made quite as
and the keeper might pay the price the
save was a good
one well what a final few minutes we
have here and the fans are certainly
playing their part but can they take one
of these chances that come their way and
win this
game
a good effective pressure high up the
pitch and the fourth official confirming
that we'll have one additional minute
time running out but they could yet win
it and there is the referee's whistle
for full time even stepen here they
can't be separated we were treated to
goals and Stuart interested to get your
verdict well Derek what a good game it
was plenty of chance some good attacking
play and a couple of outstanding
individual performances I really enjoyed
that
one
while
for
