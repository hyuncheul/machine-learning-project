Shadow I looked around searched every
building and home that I found I Shadow
but felt go W stop me kept me a Flor I
felt like heaven and found my bones and
gave me Comfort when I feel alone now

you get better to the pain I will go
alone if I fall break my BS I will
scream even louder cuz I'm not dying
alone I lost my best friend to 23 she
left her body and hovered about
