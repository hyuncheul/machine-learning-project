to a game take the best I say put them
on display on repeat in your brain till

yourself down you can do some more push
past start a pain and you find the door
open it up and finally explore
everything that you thought you can
never do before and even when you feel
low you can still go even when you feel
slow you can still go even when there's
no hope you can still go I never answer
the no man I still go go go go
