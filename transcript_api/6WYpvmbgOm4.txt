a wonderful scene here at Wembley an
ocean of fans descending upon the
stadium for what promises to be an
absolute at long last the wait is over a
warm welcome to Wembley this is Derek
Ray joined in the commentary Box by
Stuart Robson
and we're approaching kickoff time in
what promises to be a spectacular FA Cup
Final it is Tottenham Hotspur taking on
Chelsea well Derek as a youngster
growing up this was the day that every
young footballer dreamt of playing in
the FA Cup Final walking out in front of
the 100,000 fans at Wembley broadcast
around the world it still brings a
tingle to my spine and I'm really
looking forward to this
one well the goalkeeper dealt with it
admirably and a look at the Chelsea
starting 11 Christian pic starts with
Raheem Sterling out wide and the main
Striker for this match is Gerard
[Applause]
Moreno
Sterling now with
jinho just the challenge that was
[Applause]
required
kuski
[Applause]
Hunter
kte and here's Gerard
Moreno and goo Con on high marks for
that
pass that's well
[Applause]
blocked it is now with
jinho
it's a perfect
[Applause]
challenge well you can probably see why
we're focusing on this fellow as one to
watch Stewart in particular what do you
expect to see from him well Derek he's
brilliant in the air so expect Crossing
to be a big part of their game plan
today making the pitch big getting the
ball out wide and deliver as many
crosses into the box as
possible excellent
Vision well he really read that
[Applause]
brilliantly
Hunter and a Tottenham hbur free kick
coming
[Applause]
up
hiier well no stopping him a good and
fair
challenge
Moreno psic
now cross fired over they couldn't take
advantage of the
opportunity jinho and the cross smuggled
away then
enur and there to
[Applause]
intercept Benton
Cur but in the crowd they want to see
him take on the shot oh a goal for spars
it's the opening statement in the final
and it could be massively important for
them well here we can see it again and
he does so well to skip Beyond The
Defender it just spis him that bit of
time to get his shot away that's a
really nice
goal so Chelsea get things going again
how will they reply to that set
[Applause]
back Gerard
Moreno given away by
[Applause]
Chelsea Kung
[Applause]
Minon wonderful Challenge and a throw in
coming
[Applause]
up
galdo delivered into the box well the
cross came over and a real need to get
rid of the ball here can they do
something positive on the
Counterattack they need to get bod's
back can he get them level and rattling
the post and keeper ball in the end well
look at the relief out there that looked
a certain goal didn't it well of course
Chelsea will be frustrated at the moment
they thought that was The Equalizer
they've got to keep the pressure on now
yes so near indeed but now they've got
to concentrate on keeping their
defensive
[Applause]
shape Benton Cur moving into the
advanced
position son given away by
Tottenham
well as the stats confirm Chelsea have
controlled the ball but without really
creating enough chances they've almost
passed the ball for the sake of it they
need to start getting oh Stewart they've
got to score superb
[Applause]
stop who can he pick out well that was
quality last dicks
defending and the throw into
Spurs
hiier the cross is on and Thiago Silva
knows a thing or two about
blocking oh lovely ball well it looked
like a decent Avenue of attack but he
couldn't keep himself on side well he's
just a bit too eager there all well and
good playing on the shoulder but he just
needs to bend his run to stay on
side Hunter
and hir with
it
raldo really important piece of last
ditch
[Applause]
defending
psic and here's Geral
Moreno and Chelsea have given it
away Gerard
Moreno
[Applause]
Benton
Cur he's given it
away a real opening now oh The Equalizer
just what they needed and their dream
remains very much alive well let's look
at this again Derek because the
transition when the ball changes hands
is so quick and one V one against the
keeper Gerard Moreno does everything
think right he hits it with power he
hits it with accuracy and he gives the
goalkeeper no chance brilliant
[Applause]
[Music]
goal and as the second half commences
both sides can reflect on a first half
in which they were so very evenly
[Applause]
matched
and good inter seted
it lovely ball over the
top
Sterling and that's gone out of play for
what will be a goal
kick
Grimaldo it's with
banur Hunter
hiier well there's no getting away from
it he has been the subject of transfer
speculation Stuart interested to know
your thoughts on the matter if the
papers are right oh hang on Stuart big
chance here oh it's a goal A celebratory
moment as they jump in
front
well you have to ask where's the
defending the keeper is completely
exposed but he still had to finish it
and he did it really well it's a good
goal having fallen behind let's see what
sort of response we get from Chelsea in
this
[Applause]
game effective
[Applause]
challenge
forki he continues has
[Applause]
run oh surely and that's a very good
[Applause]
p
kukura and here's Gerard
Moreno
Sterling
jinho and they continue to advance and a
lot of options here now can they counter
clinically all hands on
[Applause]
deck and showing fine
vision and hammered in there perfectly
positioned to take it
away and don't forget we have more
Premier League action coming up for you
on eatv it's Tottenham Hotspur facing
Manchester
United
will he play it in good
[Applause]
tackle
[Applause]
Romero hung
minson given away by
[Applause]
Tottenham
[Applause]
hiier
Hunter it's with kib
Bali now continues his
run and a good challenge to bring that
attack to an
end well this is certainly the home of
live football EA TV and looking forward
to bringing you more action from the
Premier League it's Chelsea facing
Everton and the cross smuggled
[Applause]
away Hunter now Romero with
it
Emerson a chance for him to get in in
behind
maybe
son important facet of his oh could be
oh body in the way
crucially and into the last 15 minutes
of
[Applause]
action Top Class
[Applause]
defending
[Applause]
plenty of support
[Applause]
here Benton
Cur it should be and with that they'
thed the
[Applause]
opportunity now we're inside the final
10 minutes in this one
[Applause]
KUSI not to be advised giving the ball
away in that
[Applause]
position and unable to pick out a
teammate and that will be a
throw so deciding to make a Personnel
change at this juncture onto the pitch
23
Sterling and here's Gerard
Moreno but he was in the right place to
intercept
Moreno con has it and a strong
[Applause]
tackle
hiier
[Applause]
and habits getting it forward but they
need an
equalizer no problems for the
keeper there is going to be stoppage
time but only the one
minute and what can they do to stop him
running at them oh a go to level us up
and the closing stages who's going to
claim the TRU me it's an open question
here goal for Chelsea that is that after
90 minutes they are level and extra time
is coming
[Applause]
up it ought to
[Music]
be the pitch number 33 Ben Davis to be
replaced by number 15 Eric D
substitution for T back on the way here
and it's quite simple both teams must
steal themselves for 30 extra
minutes
janiel
Kali
hiier
Hunter and return to choru he r the
situation defensively and did his
job Giovani
loela and heier with it
chavanu poor attempt at a pass
really Kai havitz
Sterling has it attacking possibilities
for
Chelsea but they took care of the
situation
defensively
hars must take the lead here oh but he's
missed it how on Earth is this still
Level well I just don't know Derek just
a real lack of composure in the end they
should be ahead
now
[Applause]
well it's been such a good game so far
chances and goals at both ends and all
played at a great Tempo it's certainly
been a good
watch well a classic example of how to
intercept and the counter looks on here
options
available and Sterling has it good
looking ball there could be a chance now
well not allowed to continue he had
drifted into the offside position well
if he takes a step back to the ball and
then spins in behind he'll be on side
but he does know where the space
is
s and space to cross
it can he put them ahead pivotal moment
[Applause]
defensively effective looking
pass and listic has
it halime in extra time and
still and they're making a
change well the drama continues to
unfold second period of extra time now
subti for chel coming off the pitch
number seven kante to be
rep number three
marus
vuma oh big opportunity oh wonderful sa
well he reacts so quickly there that's a
great
save who can he pick out it comes to
absolutely
nothing chanu
[Applause]
magnificent challenge to win it
back
[Applause]
cholu successfully cut
out
[Applause]
Romero the ball with Marcos Alonzo Kai
hits and Chelsea still knocking on the
door in the closing minutes can they
find a
winner
KY it's with
chanu now counterattacking possibilities
here well that break looked so promising
but nothing coming from it well they
might be on to something he's in
position oh no couldn't beaten the
[Applause]
goalkeeper
Puma given away by
[Applause]
Tottenham
Hunter
chanu galdo
can he find the net just made sure
nothing came of
that a chance for him to get in behind
Maybeck and thwarted there following the
cross can they Forge ahead a final that
will
[Applause]
live
[Music]
V and now it is all about the penalty
shootout and he finds the net he could
hardly Miss can he
convert he might be wishing that hadn't
been his plan of
[Applause]
attack and his own unique run up there
but a good goal his turn to try to
convert from the
spot he scored in the bottom
[Applause]
corner
superbly done how many players would try
that goalkeeper beaten from the
spot can he get the better of the
keeper and he
scores almost intolerable
[Applause]
pressure oh that's it the final active
the drama one team jubilant the other
distraught well what an ending to a very
good tournament and I think they fully
deserve to win it maybe not in this
manner though but it was great
entertainment it certainly was and
they're not going to forget this in a
hurry a proud moment for everyone
involved with the club but for their
opponents it's a case of trying to
forget and move on as quickly as
possible well I think we should give
them some credit too they played their
part in What was an excellent contest
some of the their football was brilliant
yes fair play Stuart the party in full
swing now it's going to be quite the
night of Celebration
[Applause]
here
[Music]
man made yeah time and again make a good
top turn not a politician and not you

going to wait but you got to tell me you
better locate if if it's taking on my
time yeah I'm trying to come through
yeah I'm bringing something new yeah I'm
trying to
come count
again
rul
[Music]
I
[Music]
I
it is a head-to-head confrontation we
can quite simply never get enough of
talk about high-profile this qualifies
and then some stay with us for complete
coverage from North London as Spurs face
Manchester United hello a warm welcome
and this is the scene here in North
London my name is Derek Ray and sitting
alongside me in the commentary box
providing expert analysis it's Stuart
Robson and looking forward to bringing
you action from the Premier League
coming right up it is Tottenham hot spur
up against Manchester United well Derek
when looking forward to this game you
can't help but notice there are some
great matchups all over the pitch
particularly in those Central areas
whichever team wins more of those
battles will win the
game Scott
Momin decent position this for United to
find themselves
in
[Applause]
the lineup for Manchester United David
DEA stands between the posts rapael
Varan plays with Victor Lindelof in
central defense and in this tactical
setup they have just the one player in
[Applause]
attack well sometimes we have a fierce
relegation battle
sometimes not at all and baring a
miracle over the run in it looks pretty
clearcut in terms of who's going down
now Stuart well unfortunately Derek the
table doesn't lie it the teams in the
relegation Zone just haven't been good
enough it's as simple as that really
intense pressure
applied timely intervention superb
block
kib now son
hiier how can he take them on and beat
them no foul Spurs
Advantage Dean
kuluski it did look on for them but not
to
[Applause]
be Jed Spence delightful pass offside it
is but he needed sharp eyes to make that
decision well it's fine margins isn't it
but in the end he just went too
early and we're looking at a player who
seems to be at the peak of his powers
hung Minon in what way might he
contribute today Stuart well Derek we
know he loves linking up with other
players but it's when he's in and around
the penalty area that's when he's at his
most dangerous when he plays little one
tubes around his marker and then plays
the next forward pass into a runner he
could be the key to unlocking this
[Applause]
defense Jared
boen more than decent this from
United chance to play it
in brona
[Applause]
fernan super tackle and they've won POS
[Applause]
session
chanu Hunter intelligent threaded pass
here but mistimed his run well he's got
the timing all wrong there he just needs
to B his
[Applause]
time it's going to be United's free
[Applause]
kick
well he's given it
away
Hunter and on to
koseski this is Varan and given
away oh breezing past
him magnificent defending nice and easy
for the
keeper
fan well goal news to bring you from the
Everton game Alex Scott has the details
yes it's a goal for Chelsea they're back
level it's one0 with 31 minutes played
thanks us always to Alex
Scott let's see about the delivery not
away
completely a good and fair
challenge
Alasia Sancho
now Scott
Momin decent position this for United to
find themselves in but nothing comes of
it good defending it
[Applause]
was
Hunter well as the stats show us this
has been a really even game so far there
just hasn't been enough gu or invention
in the top third of field from either
team which needs to change at some
point passing it around looking for the
goal that would put them
ahead well showing excellent judgment to
intercept but he's certainly not
alone son can he put them in front yes
is the emphatic answer and you have to
say it was on the
cards well there it is it's a lovely
finish just the right side of the post
close but good
enough so on they go again and that
really should shake up United can they
find a response
[Applause]
now
kibali
Hunter and hir with it well they're
quite content to knock it around inside
the own
half
chanu on borderline offside but
[Applause]
correct Fred
and just one minute of time added on for
stoppages here is
Fred and he's got the beating of his
opponent this could be the equalizer
just had to keep his concentration to
the maximum and he
did so the corner played into the box
and a decent save full
credit and there it is the halim
whistle
[Music]
so back underway with United looking to
plot a route back into this
[Applause]
game hey
now s well Spurs now in potentially a
dangerous
position
son and return to
[Music]
chanu getting
forward
chanu and still a
chance and thumped
away well the transfer story appear to
be real there's some substance behind
this one Stuart well if the papers are
right the figure being banded about is
around 40 million which although is a
lot of money I think it's a fair offer
it's just a case of whether Spurs think
that's a good enough price to let him
go and the ball back with
United Hunter
Kung minson and the emphasis is on
creativity
chanu well a classic example of how to
intercept Bruno
fernan Spence
hiier must be well there's a keeper on
song well how did he stop that that's
just
unbelievable
malasia well I'm hearing a change to the
score line in the Everson game Alex
Scott can tell us more it's a second
goal for Chelsea could the goalkeeper
have done better yes but let's not take
nothing away from that finish they're
now behind by one with 60 Minutes on the
clock Alex thank you very
much oh in with a chance and it's a
double for him in this game no way for
the opposition to contain him and no
wonder he's off
celebrating well here it is again and
you have to say the onew completely
opens up the defensive structure and
then through on goal he just goes for
power and smashes it past the keeper
there's no stopping that what a great
finish so underway again and two-nil
Advantage here number 10
martinz
Hunter it's with
[Applause]
chalano can he put it away oh dealt with
by the
goalkeeper both managers deciding this
is the time to change things around both
teams going to the
bench timely intervention
well Spurs are looking really good today
just look how many chances they have
created and I sense there's still more
to come here and would you know it
another potential opening developing
[Applause]
here well that's how to keep the
opposition at
Bay this might be the perfect
counterattacking
[Applause]
opportunity jayen Sancho
P wasano interception to Snuff out the
danger
[Applause]
son can he take
advantage and a goal what a magnificent
display it's such a one-sided contest
here well here it is again and it was
never really in doubt was it he was
always going to score from
[Applause]
there this is looking rather comfortable
for them 3
[Applause]
n Fred substitution for to hman coming
off the pitch a quarter of an hour
remaining here DJ SP to be replaced by
number 33 Davis
rashford chance maybe well not every
keeper would have been that brave well
he read it brilliantly didn't he top
stuff from The
Keeper pressing High to win the
ball jayen Sancho really vital
interception well delighted to say more
Premier League action coming up for you
here on eatv it's Spurs facing Everton
well the counter chance looks very
real well nicely cut
out
Fred and cash with
it
Sancho back was Sancho
and a significant block following that
[Applause]
cross well Spurs with the ball
again and just five minutes
remaining so almost at full time and the
home side very much in command Stuart
what have you made of their overall
performance well what an excellent
performance this has been they've had
complete control for most of the game
their movement clever passing and energy
have been a joy to watch it's been a
really good win for
[Applause]
them a Running Room in the wide
position a wonderful
intervention Fred it's now with Van the
[Applause]
bake rashford in the middle oh terrific
save from The Keeper well that's just a
wonderful save how did he stop
[Applause]
that played
over and first class defending cleared
off the line making high pressing work
for them here just made sure nothing
came of that and the referee blows as
whistle it's full time here and Spurs
have prevailed your assessment well
Derek they were the better team all over
the
pit
[Music]
