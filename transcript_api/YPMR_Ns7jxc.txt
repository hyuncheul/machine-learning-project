Lions yeah they played well in the last
game but they need to match that
performance today it should be a good
game this one Well that took confidence
and a look at the lineup for the Kings
Leb Yashin begins in goal homar Sawa
starts alongside shaby in in the center
of Midfield as in attack today kilan
mbappe starts with
usia homar
Sawa now can she pick out her
[Applause]
teammate
Sawa it should be a pure Instinct from
The Keeper well a top class reaction
from a top class goalkeeper brilliant
stuff
[Applause]
Alexia
[Applause]
payas intercepting it
intelligently well considering the form
book Stuart kilan mbappe has got to be
taken seriously here well what a goal
scorer he is his finishing is so calm
and compos Stuart they could be in
here and the referee doesn't hesitate
that is a spot kick
[Applause]
this to make it one n and he FS it away
confidently well Lions get things
restarted swift reply required after
this
setb he's in behind they just couldn't
stay in front and now this match is all
square
on the perfect position to read it
considerable momentum courtesy of
Ronaldo but what can he produce from
here and deflected behind so a corner
here Messi with the
[Applause]
corner well a struggle for the Kings to
keep the
ball that me to the goal that puts them
ahead
oh that's a super piece of Defending
Ronaldo Real defens of
Brazilians
Messi oh commanding
goalkeeping who's going to get on the
end of it No Nonsense
[Applause]
clearance
mbapp progress is Tian
mbapp
bastor pretty well
positioned
Ronaldo teammates
available chaby onto mbapp oh tremendous
block could cross it in here
spot on with that
tle and a goal to reestablish their
advantage just look at the
celebrations and across the touch line
so a throw in
here makes the Lions turn
now
[Applause]
did look as though they might be on to
something for a second or
[Applause]
so and the Kings moving the ball with
purpose but nothing comes of it good
defending it
[Applause]
was ball played
nicely B
[Applause]
pass
homar
Asawa
shabi oh she's made a crucial tackle
[Applause]
there oh good
vision and quick thinking
[Applause]
defensively
jinho kfu with
it well that's an attractive passing
move but it's all about finding an
equalizer here oh a level the match and
they've done it to square the game once
again
accelerating and level again here this
has been quite the roller coaster
ride nice ball to switch the point of
attack shaby
kfu with
it
B
Marin tremendously strong in the
[Applause]
tackle
mbappe Omar
isawa
and on to
bastor and players waiting on the
center oh this is looking
[Applause]
promising William
SBA vjo van
dijk
usabo struggling to get the shot off and
fling his opponent in the lick of
time well this is a big moment and don't
these fans know it and the cross goes
[Applause]
in a time for calm on the ball breaking
at
PACE well a successful intervention
winning the ball
back well just one minute of time added
on for stoppages here oh that's a can he
put them in front and nicely parried
away
a chance then for the respective
managers to address their charges it is
halime
here
underway then in the second half and the
two teams matching each other just about
stride for
stride well that's the side of a well
organized
defense Philip
lamb
Messi sweet looking move from
Lions
Ronaldo simple save
really to jump in front oh the crossbar
is still reverberating
can he finish and you cannot argue with
a hattick simply Unstoppable
today
Sawa and onto
shabby you can sense the threat is
there a good and fair
challenge
possession lost by
lions
usio the importance of that tackle
cannot be
overstated marin oh maybe The
Equalizer a glorious chance and that's
the hatrick tearing apart this defense
time and again they simply can't handle
it a lot of forward thrust here from
Ronaldo now what can he do from this
excellent
[Applause]
position Roo van
dijk and the Kings unable to retain
possession we have 30 minutes to go
B the supporters want to see him have a
go P go
ahead that is tackling of the highest
order Cristiano
Ronaldo
MPP onto
jinho Top Class defending
great vision to switch the
play and he really read that
brilliantly now counter attacking
possibilities
here well they need to get bodies back
and collected tidily he had plent need
to think about well goalkeeper mistake
will there be a price to
pay
mbapp an alert piece of
[Applause]
Defending well these players must be
motivated the crowd have been great
can't they now get the
winner and Kings finding space on the
flank and the keeper making sure nothing
on toward
happened AWA wasteful from the
Kings oh superb
skill
Ronaldo
mbapp he's certainly not
alone
calu back to
shaby
bastar and here's
Sawa timely
[Applause]
intervention
kit
L and cuts inside lonel
Messi opportunity
oh yes a goal exactly what they were
looking for and he's come up with
[Applause]
it VTO van
djk good ball to switch the
play now with
shaby they haveon them to level this
well it came to nothing in the
end well this game is far from over
probably get one more big chance before
the end the crowd certainly think so
just listen to that
noise and lions moving the ball forward
with
[Applause]
purpose the defensive intervention
there and it comes down to the final 5
minutes that's a fine looking ball from

diving save to deny the
opportunity
