stands in front of them the knowledge
that a win is required to make it
through to the promotion match and no
doubt about it their opponents won't be
of a mind to do them any favors at
all the match is live on

[Applause]
Bale oh stylish ball what can they do
now it's looking
promising the attack carried an initial
threat but fizzled
[Applause]
out
Bale well we simply had to feature him
today after he broke the club's goal
scoring record in his last appearance
yeah what a great achievement but he
won't want to stop there he loves
scoring goals and I'm sure there's a lot
more to come from him including a couple
more
today
[Applause]
so spot on with that
challenge
Pino can they trouble the opposition
this
time intercepting it
intelligently excellent refereeing
advantage in
operation strong but fair
[Applause]
tackle
k
and a fine
cross well nothing comes of it aware of
the threat solving the
problem it look as though they had
attacking momentum but not so must take
the lead here excellent
block now with
and pressing from the
front
Ry and the pass deathly cut
out and back with
[Applause]
Kang back with Ramos and playing it
through
the referee spotted the little Nick on
the way through so a throw Inc coming
up excellent assessment of the situation
at the
[Applause]
back
and in the right position to read
it lovely ball over the
top and there it is the Breakthrough
that will do
nicely One n
[Applause]
then
couldn't quite find his
teammate oh what a top doch
pass
Divo struggling to hold on to the
ball oh that's a really good
authoritative tackle throw in
[Applause]
here effective
challenge the referee allowing advantage
to ACR to
them
Divo and a tidy
ball superb looking
pass well unable to hold his run and
that's
[Applause]
offside possession changing
hands and face to cross
[Applause]
[Applause]
it the referee allowing the play to
flow and with that the first half draws
to a
close
[Applause]
second
[Applause]
well underway once more and it's going
to be fascinating to see what the
developments occur in this second
half
Bruno Bale they couldn't maintain
[Applause]
possession
Divo oh really good
pass the cross is
on well the Defenders know they need to
get tighter can't really allow runs like
that text Book closing down and now
they're on the attack tremendously
strong in the
[Applause]
tackle Bale putting in quite the shift
to win the ball
back
[Applause]
Bruno continues his
run chance to cross well he made sure
there was absolutely no way
through getting in there to
intercept counterattacking very much an
option
in behind for him to
chase well cleared
[Applause]
away
Divo now with
Bruno and back with
K well we have 30 minutes to
go
and take it
away
[Applause]
Bale and defensive play to be
[Applause]
applauded
Distributing it
well a very timely
interception well that's ey catching
wide
play oh this look useful that is a very
fine challenge in difficult
circumstances this is a message
and Amos has it now to the nearest thank
you well they want that equalizer but
the passing remains
smooth high quality
defending Bale
[Applause]
incisive pass triy to chip it over with
the keeper well full credit to him he
had the audacity to try it well that's
so close to being a lovely goal it just
doesn't come down in
[Music]
time and the throw in fourth
coming well there you have it your way
team have had so much of the possession
that they've shown a real lack of
creativity today they need to be far
more inventive in the final thir if
they're to turn things around
[Applause]
here well read to win possession back
you can't really tackle like that and
expect to get away with it booking to
come you would
[Applause]
think just 15 minutes
remaining good
[Applause]
defending and intercepted it
Divo trying to open them up just needs
to stay calm oh a goal and every
player's worst nightmare because this
will go down as a own
[Applause]
goal
has a go oh a tremendous
[Applause]
block magnificent challenge to win it
[Applause]
back
Divo well a really good
run but they took care of the situation
defensively
pavlof showing good defensive
[Applause]
judgment and the electronic board
showing one additional
minute Divo
this is Bruno and there goes the final
whistle and the home fans are going to
be happy about this
[Applause]
outc to the game they defended well
enough they dominated Midfield and they
created chances as well it was a great
[Applause]
performance
I
as a footballer you desperately want to
be involved in these matches so much on
the line and this is the first promotion
game The Players had better be ready for
what the opposition will throw at them
this promises to be
special stay with us on EA
TV
good evening and welcome ahead of what
should be a pulsating night of football
I'm Derek Ray and joining me to provide
expert analysis is Stuart Robson and
excitement levels are high as they get
ready to appear in a promotion match for
the first time Stuart what are you
expecting to see well I've enjoyed
watching them up to this point but today
will be tough that's for sure they'll
need to be at their very best to win
here I
think and credit due a good
[Applause]
intervention Ramos with
it and back with
k
Divo and unable to keep the
ball chance to attack using
[Applause]
wit
John
Divo onto Bruno oh great
vision well they've lost possession of
the ball excellent refereeing advantage
in
operation and yang has
it and he's in an offside
position
Yang
man very alert defending to cut off the
supply
Ramos it has gone over the touch line
for what'll be a throw
in
man and easily
intercepted teammates available and that
puts him in position he's in position oh
a moment of pure class had to catch it
perfectly and didn't he
[Applause]
just
Divo
Bale that's a good ball clearance needed
to be better
[Applause]
well there was impending danger but good
defending and back with
Kang well there's an example of how to
press high up decent looking
[Applause]
pass opportunity to deliver the
cross well he's almost been hassled out
of play
here and he was in the right place to
intercept and made sure the pass wasn't
troublesome
[Applause]
this is
Bruno oh that's a super ball over the
top and a goal to level this contest all
even so in business once more on the
back of that very important equalizer
1-1 man
now do they mean business on this
occasion dangerous looking attack very
alert defending to put a stop to the
chance
k
well nothing comes of
it and the defensive intervention
there and showing fine
Vision took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
them
and a good looking
ball and there it breaks down but credit
to the
defense it's a neat
move and he read it
superbly
Bruno
and intercepted
it
Bale intelligent threaded pass here oh
it almost did the trick for them great
defending
could play it
in and so it is the first half
[Applause]
story
well underway once more and it's going
to be fascinating to see what
developments occur in this second half
[Applause]
a really single-minded piece of
Defending to make sure nothing unto
happened can they hit on the
break well it came to nothing in the
end and putting pay to the
danger that is how to apply the
pressure Ramos
now Bruno effective challenge well since
they have the ball the referee playing
Advantage here and the flag has gone up
off
[Applause]
side and he read it well intercepting
it now he must favor the
cross well there's an example of how to
press high
up L to the ball
well at one point on its flight I
wondered if the keeper would have
difficulties but no problems at the
end and quick thinking
defensively
man well we can give them high marks for
their passing but can they make this
pressure count running the ball he just
needs to keep a cool head and a goal it
is to put them in front again no less
than they
[Applause]
deserve
John
Divo and a decent delivery
and the attack fizzling
out oh that's a super piece of
Defending but he certainly not
alone Scot that's Scott please make your
way to the ticket office you have your
wife's ticket thank you not to like
about that pass
angles it back B is loose and there it
is a goal I must say much to the
annoyance of the
[Applause]
keeper
Bale chance to do damage but they dealt
with the threat
posed onto young and threading it
through really good buildup but no end
product
Bale Ramos with
it well he's won the
[Applause]
ball feeding it
through and the flag has gone up here
offside the
decision
Bale and out of play the pass nearly
worked out but not
quite well great read there to
intercept
man well read to put an end to that
attack a chance maybe from the wide
position and a fine
cross and stopping the danger it might
be the crossbar got in the
way and just over the top in the end but
the idea was good well good effort you
have to say but it just doesn't come
down in
time 10 minutes to go clean
Challenge and the referee playing
Advantage flag Rays for
[Applause]
offside Divo
back with
Ramos
Bale well we've entered the final 5
minutes this is
Bruno but on you go says the referee
advantage
and space to cross
[Applause]
it a very timely
interception could be a chance to break
here oh nice
ball Fan's it and nearly a goal after
that breathtaking move well that was
counterattacking football at its very
best un fortunately they just couldn't
finish it
off and that will be all for this game
defeat for the visitors
[Applause]
that don't think they deserved anything
from the game they need to get a better
performance in next time
out
for
there
for
that's
is
for
