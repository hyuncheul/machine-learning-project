any higher a win here and they'll get
themselves a promotion match it should
be
[Applause]
exciting and he's fired over the corner
and able he dealt
with elting to cross into the
center and making his move inside well
didn't go a plan in the
end trying to open up the
defense well goal kick just as it was
looking
promising
and pressing from the
[Applause]
front well it works like this breaking
the club's goal scoring record brings
you attention well as you mentioned the
record was broken last time out but
expect more today this is a player
that's hungry for goals and has the
ability to keep scoring
[Applause]
them
[Applause]
might be on to something with that
ball an effect of
clearance ball retention so important if
those are your items please collect them
after the game thank
[Applause]
you
and
valver fluency of
movement let's see if something comes to
this can they
convert and putting paid to the
[Applause]
danger the sporting can use width to
good effect L into the box pass it
away dangerous looking through
[Applause]
ball to give them the
[Applause]
advantage and the danger is
[Applause]
averted really clever
pressing
and passing it
well well no way
[Applause]
through well no stopping him and
teammates to play it
to oh my goodness you've really got to
praise the defending that was
topnotch that's a lovely
ball and a precise challenge just when
it was
[Applause]
requir and in the perfect position to
read
it
good
distribution now the keeper doesn't have
to worry too much about that
[Applause]
one
[Applause]
ccho
[Applause]
not a great Challenge free kick
[Applause]
here well the Defenders know they need
to get tighter can't really allow runs
like
[Applause]
that Crossing
possibilities intercepting it
intelligently we can get more details on
that injury situation from our man pitch
side Jeff Rees Jeff he keeps looking
down and feeling his foot so that's
obviously the problem and I think it
came from that last challenge cheers
Jeff
Nam
Bren plenty of
options but it Fizzles out thanks to
that piece of
[Applause]
Defending
[Applause]
Kane what can he do with it
now and that'll be
[Applause]
offside
[Applause]
Bren
Nam and in the right position to read it
that's a good
[Applause]
ball
a better of Running Room now on the
wing oh that's a super ball over the
top oh it's off the
post the referee's whistle the first
half story has been written it's halime
here at the King Power
Stadium
like
away they go again second half is
underway
here and nicely over the top and reading
it absolutely
[Applause]
superbly
Bren
Nam shooting
chance using all his his defensive
Acumen to cut it
out
heril well we can give them high marks
for their passing but can they make this
pressure count now the teams are locked
together will it stay that way following
this corner well just listen to these
fans they're urging their team to score
here and take the
lead let's see about the delivery the
keeper takes the fall but the main thing
is he held on to
[Applause]
it and sporting in a position of
potential
[Applause]
Menace can they hit on the
break and just like that the
Counterattack comes to an
end
Now options are
plenty crossed into the penalty
area oh it's gone in and that will be
written down as the known goal no wonder
he's hanging his
[Applause]
head
so the match has restarted 1 n
here the
Oliva very effective passing
sequence and he could really get at the
opposition will he play it
[Applause]
in this could level it still
possibilities and the deflection means a
corner well just listen to the fans they
know this is a big chance
here short Corner
[Applause]
taken a cut
back
blocked it
[Applause]
brilliantly a poor cross All Things
Considered and they'll get ready for the
throw
[Applause]
in now the disappointing
[Applause]
throw
took a really smart piece of Defending
to stop
[Applause]
them
Nam now what can they produce on the
flank it's there for
him and both hands on it good
goalkeeping
they've regained
[Applause]
possession plenty of players waiting in
the
middle opportunity and still a chance oh
it's in and a goal on his debut no less
what a way to endear yourself to the
fans so a level contest
1-1
n just 15 minutes
remaining
Don just looking for the right moment
for that final pass a glorious chance
and denied by The Keeper
impressive and this might not be the
ideal situation for them he'll be
delighted to have won the ball having
made that difficult
challenge that is how to apply the
pressure textbook closing down and now
they're on the
attack
not messing around with that
clearance excellent ball over the top
and the flag raised offside it
is
Kane options in the
middle and it cross the touch line so a
throw in
[Applause]
here this might be the perfect
counterattacking
opportunity can they profit from this
could be terrific
save and cleared away
[Applause]
level pegging but can they change
[Applause]
that
Özil a de
clearance we will have a couple of
additional minutes at the end
here chance for him to get in behind
[Applause]
maybe nuda and the referee brings this
contest to an end it certainly was
pulsating it had us on the edge of our
seats Stuart your take well it was
excellent entertainment we saw good
quality football played at a high
intensity and goals as well the draw is
a fair reflection of how the game was
played
[Applause]
everyone here on tenter hooks and you
can understand why if they draw this
game or better they'll make it through
to the promotion match and that would be
be a real cause for
[Applause]
celebration next on EA
[Applause]
[Applause]
TV one of the great things about
football is that no one knows for sure
what's going to happen let's see what
unfolds here here tonight I'm Derek Ray
and sitting next to me with his tactics
charts at the ready is Stuart Robson and
if things go well for them they can
qualify for a promotion match Stuart
what are you expecting well Derek it's
certainly in their hands if they can get
a draw here a promotion match will be
theirs they just need to put in a good
performance it won't be easy
though oh great vision and the snuffing
out of the Cross
there
Kane clean
[Applause]
challenge
[Applause]
Yoshida but he could run onto it here
and that'll be
offside well it works like this breaking
the club's goal scoring record brings
you attention yeah what a great
achievement but he won't want to stop
there he loves scoring goals and I'm
sure there's a lot more to come from him
including a couple more
today who can he pick
out oh commanding
[Applause]
goalkeeping he's driven in the corner
there it is the opening go of this match
and what a start they've
made
One n
then throw in
given
Hong
Akuna and then in the right position to
read
it
[Applause]
Pang well back and forth in terms of
possession this could be
[Music]
[Applause]
Troublesome this could be the equalizer
and it goes to square the game what a
contest this is turning out to
be so back underway following The
[Applause]
Equalizer
Hong a very effective challenge put in
making
progress but a good piece of Defending
to bring it to an
[Applause]
end opportunity to take the lead and
there is the goal to reestablish their
[Applause]
advantage
so on they go again will there be a
response from sporting here there needs
to
be and a throw in it's going to
be oh the ball goes out of play for
what'll be a goal
[Applause]
kick being pressed
hard
Yu and intercepts
[Applause]
again well he's lost the
[Music]
ball
Hong
y
[Applause]
you high pressing and good high
pressing oh nice
ball can he put it
in and it's a penalty the referee points
to the spot and it's going from bad to
worse and it has been judged to have
been a bookable offense well I think the
referee's got that right all around it
was a penalty and it was a yellow
card is it going to be
3-1 a goal accurate from the
spot no shortage of goals on this match
3-1
ccho
you
Yoshida how about the
cross looking for the final pass that
will open things up but then the one
that fails to hit its
[Applause]
Target flag Rays for offside
[Applause]
good ball over the top opportunity and
he scored not once but twice they simply
cannot stop him and no wonder he's
enjoying
himself
well you've got to say an incredible
first half performance that score line
tells you all you need to
know well slightly of Target and that'll
be a throwi
in well the visitors have controlled
possession as you can see yes they've
played well when going forward but it's
been their ability to regain the ball
which has made them so hard to play
against here and it makes them such a
good team it's been a brilliant
performance so far well that's right an
unusual usually they don't have the ball
on this
[Applause]
occasion how can he take them on and
beat
them
Akuna and nicely over the top mby and
upper grabs off the
keeper
Hong
you could be
threatening nicely timed
tackle and one minute of stoppage time
has been added on real
[Applause]
chance well no more time left that
concludes the first half here at the
King Power
Stadium
best
the ball rolling again the first half
struggles of sporting were there for all
to see can they make a better fist of it
in this
half and tidy defensive
play
[Applause]
promising sequence but quick thinking
defensively very quick thinking
[Applause]
there
passes like that very much in his
[Applause]
repertoire sporting sloppy in
possession promising
[Applause]
pass
[Applause]
Özil
oil given away
again
Özil
Kane and that the attack Fizzles
out and room now out on the
wing oh surely and a wonderful diving
save to deny the
[Applause]
opportunity who's going to get on the
end of it well I think it's fair to say
the pressure from the defender push him
off a
bit
well we're into the final half
[Music]
hour good run very much in control of
the
situation and back with
pinto lot to like about that pass chance
to finish not a harmless efforts when
all is said and
done
great effort to keep that one in
[Applause]
[Applause]
Play What a magnificent
pass and everyone in the center looking
on as it sailed over them good use of
Advantage there a meaty but fair
Challenge and it will be a
[Applause]
throwing from one side of the pitch to
the
other he got in the way of that cross
and a very good
challenge
Benzema
Yu the ball back was sping
[Applause]
now good ball to switch the
play
[Applause]
Crossing towards the far post but it was
never really going to be of concern to
the keeper that
[Applause]
one
Yu
auna given away by sporting beautiful
[Applause]
pass
[Applause]
U well let's see what they have in store
for them on the break it looked like
open road for them but up a dead
end in search of space textbook
defending Inside the
Box
really nice
ball oh off the post still
alive Corner
awarded let's see about the delivery
Splendid
defending in a good position to clear it
away
and running it
back we've entered the final 5
minutes and passing it
through really shoot the fans H so well
body in the
way oh it's gone in a significant
deflection leaving the keeper
[Applause]
flx well that's the replay shows it
takes a deflection and as a result the
keeper had very little chance there they
just got a bit of
luck what can they do to stop him
running at
them and it's gone out of play goal kick
coming
up and the referee has added on two
minutes of stoppage
time
well doesn't have to do it on his
[Applause]
own and the cross goes in and the No
Nonsense
clearance and that is the end of the
game it goes into the history books as a
home defeat well Derek they weren't at
their best today
both
what
ni's
go
for
