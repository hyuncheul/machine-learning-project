for now you can stay right here we will
play until somehow you can find slightly
different frame of mind right here in my
arms away from all harm you'll be safe
from all the flares although I know you
don't
[Music]
care
oh
[Music]
you can lift your head up to the sky
take a deeper breath and give it time
you can walk the path among the lines
with your shattered frame of mind that

here and play until somehow you can find
a slightly better frame of mind
[Music]
when they say you will fall you can
reach nothing at all hide your tracks
beneath the RO Mind of a different frame
of mind is that what you heard broken
words in the dirt yelling up into the
sun here we come here we
come here we come here we
come here we come here we come
W you can lift your head up to the sky
take a deeper breath and give it time
you can walk the path among the lines
with your shattered frame of M is that
you could always stay we can wait right
here and play until somehow you can find
a slightly better frame of
mind
[Music]
you can lift your head up to the sky
take a deeper breath and give it time
you can walk the path among the lines
with your shattered face of mine it's
that you could always stay we can wait
right here and play until somehow you
can find a slightly better frame of mind
and when the light comes through when
that day is in you then it will be time
for a new frame of mind when all eyes
are on you you will know what to do
since you will
