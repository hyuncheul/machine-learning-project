division what do you anticipate seeing
Stuart well I've enjoyed watching them
up to this point but today will be up
that's for sure they'll need to be at
their very best to win here I
think the well to clear it
away and he's through
here and pushed away to
safety well time just challenged
magnificently
well good looking play with the ball of
defeat making sure nothing UNT
happened so the corner played into the
box just one wanted to get it out of
there plenty of supports
here a goal in the early stages
precisely what they had been
planning
[Applause]
Diaz good waight on that
pass and a fine cross oh there it is a
back and forth sort of match now they're
level again the lead lasted merely
minutes
arat Beck on the
[Applause]
[Applause]
ball
here's
Ramos now they have possession in a good
area of the
pitch
well there was impending danger but good
defending
lindegard this could be
Troublesome will he finish and a goal
just like that they're back in
front
Ramos oh made it look routine but read
it
well Jones on the
ball
arat perfectly positioned to take it
[Applause]
away wonderful chance and saved by The
Keeper Mack
that's useful
play and it's gone in the teams
separated by two goals now you cannot
say they don't deserve
it
Bruno
Diaz
Pino brilliant
pass well a vital interception to Snuff
out the
danger No Nonsense
clearance well spot on with that
challenge Crossing
opportunity play to the back first and
the pass getting in the way oh a moment
of pure class had to catch it perfectly
and didn't he just now with
Bruno and back with
K wilting under the pressure and now
they try to go
[Applause]
forward trying to to open up the defense
but a intercepted when it looked as
though they might be in feeding it
through but it's great when you can rely
on your keeper well no danger
now Ramos with
it he continues his
[Applause]
run but a good piece of Defending to
bring it to an end
Bale now with Bruno an effective
challenge incisive
pass here's
Ramos well on the cusp of the halftime
interval and they're not really enjoying
this away day are they oh he can score
here
oh he couldn't out witht the
[Applause]
keeper and there's the
delivery and stopping the
[Applause]
danger and he read it
superbly
Bruno well that one has
promise and he's
in and there is the goal he's found the
net Joy
[Applause]
unconfined so the current score line
42 well that's going to be it for the
first half the first 45
minutes
inway
well they've got things going again here
and I wonder what kind of second half we
have in store for
us
and options in the center that ball was
put into the right area but no one able
to
capitalize and that will be a
[Applause]
corner delivering
[Applause]
it so a throw in
here
[Applause]
Diaz realizing that it might be opening
up on the opposite
flank
K
Ramos perfectly positioned to take it
away
oh that's a really good run a gift for
any
goalkeeper nice looking pass and offside
[Applause]
unfortunately
Suarez decent looking
[Applause]
pass could be oh great
block this is
Bruno
Akerman Ramos with
it
Diaz now with
Bruno now the pass not finding its
Target and so 30 minutes left for play
in this
one danger averted for now but they have
a corner to
defend
blade
over really fine piece of Defending play
to break us
up this is
Bruno is it going to end up being
productive for them well it came to
nothing in the
end
oh a fine
block well a really good run now who can
he pick
out that is a very fine challenge in
difficult
circumstances oh what a perfect ball now
how about
this terrific
save
[Applause]
let's see about the delivery not the
result from the set piece they were
looking
[Applause]
for
[Applause]
[Applause]
now with
Bruno
lindegard and whipped into the box off
the post and back in play and did just
enough
defensively
corner kick played
in oh he couldn't out with the keeper
and it was turned out so a throw in will
be
next can he play it
in able to clear the danger at least for
now
[Applause]
well the short Corner
routine
Diaz really well played
pass took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
them and a throw in fourth
coming that leads an accurate
cross just knocked it out of there
Oliva
Beck
arat well time is ebing away and they're
using this passing approach to marvelous
effect
just 10 minutes remaining
here delivering it into the box that
ball was put into the right area but no
one able to capitalize wanted to keep it
but
couldn't well no point in stopping play
Advantage with them everyone wants to
see officials let the play flow in that
manner but now the free kick has to be
awarded
could be
Troublesome and angling it back terrific
piece of
anticipation not quite spot on with that
one can they do something positive on
the
[Applause]
Counterattack well a pass like that has
got to be spot on and in the end it
wasn't and the referee allowing the game
to flow using
Advantage effective
challenge
well he's lost
it he has teammates around
him there will be three minutes added on
at the
end this just
Jones
lindegard
can he find the net blocking
it could pull one back here oh good work
by The
[Applause]
Keeper trying to deliver it
accurately and that will be all for this
game defeat for the visitors that's the
big story well Derek they weren't at
their best today both as individuals and
as a team and they didn't
[Applause]
deserve
that's
everyone on tenter hooks you can feel
the tension because there's so much on
the line if they win they make it
through to the promotion match it is
that simple do they have the mental
fortitude
necessary
[Applause]
don't go anywhere this is
[Applause]
[Music]
eatv good evening and welcome ahead of
what should be a pulsating night of
football I'm Derek Ray your match
commentator and alongside providing all
the Tactical analysis is Stuart Robson
and the Chance is on for them to reserve
for themselves a promotion match Place
Stuart what are your expectations for
today well Derek a win here and they
will get themselves a promotion match
they just need to keep their nerve and
put in a decent
[Applause]
performance now with
Bruno
Diaz
Bruno
K well it's a good-looking position is
there a goal in their
future a wilting under the pressure and
now they Tred to go
forward now with
Bruno and played the pass
well it needs an accurate
cross well there was never any doubt we
were always going to be highlighting him
after his exploits in the last match
breaking the club's goal scoring record
well as you mentioned the record was
broken last time out but expect more
today this is a player that's hungry for
goals and has the ability to keep
scoring
them and they stopped them in their
tracks and foul it is
then can he play it in and a shot from
miles out
oh that's a fine
[Applause]
save corner kick played in a bit short
with the
clearance and playing it
through couldn't quite hang
on and it goes at the second time of
asking and the keeper feels hung out to
dry
Beck well great read there to
intercept this is
Bruno
Diaz and back with
[Applause]
and that puts him in
position giving it a try great defending
here and it's come off the keeper and
holding on to it at the second time of
asking could be oh what a clearance
Under Pressure had to react and did
in a decent position now and that sound
goalkeeping to hang on to the shot like
that on the ball
Ramos
Akerman space afforded
him how about the
cross they've given it
[Applause]
away and passing it
well and a good looking ball
making sure nothing un to
happened
H and very deathly cut
out
[Applause]
lindegard decided to come in from the
flank clearance left a bit to be desired
surely oh how about that for a
[Applause]
tackle well they're on the scent of
something
positive crossed accurately towards the
far
post k
Pino plenty of support here but nothing
comes of it good defending it
was plenty of room for this biggest
snakes
attack oh he's left as marker for dead
he got in the way of that cross and the
referee allowing the game to flow using
Advantage but he could run on to it
here smuggled
[Applause]
away
H here's
yakobson now space for snakes out
wide
oh that's not a good
clearance another time for
[Applause]
coolheads happy just to retain the ball
in their own half and draw out the
[Applause]
opposition
lindegard Distributing it well real
chance and you've got to credit that
magnificent piece of
defending this could be Troublesome and
the decision offside
[Applause]
here on the ball
Ramos and with that the first half draws
to a
close
[Applause]
St
well as they get the ball rolling again
interesting to see how this second half
P
[Applause]
out
well read to ease the
pressure
be
[Applause]
diabat well trailing but this looks
promising superb looking pass
and it's a goal level again what a match
this is turning out to
be well here's the replay watch how he
goes past his man with such ease and
it's just a change of pace and then the
shot could not be hit any better struck
with such Venom great
goal and he was in the right place to
intercept Now options are
[Applause]
plenty and the cross into the
middle they've only gone and grabbed
another one two goals in quick
succession now they have the lead no one
other
[Applause]
celebrating
Diaz Ramos
and back to the
[Applause]
keeper a really good
pass2 he's enjoying
space this could Square the game and
that's exactly what has transpired now
that could be a massive turning point
and momentum is with
them and space for snakes in the wide
position oh nice work to get past his
opponent able to close down the shot not
a chance here perhaps to invigorate
their aerial targets well they've been
frustrated for quite a while now but
these fans have suddenly come to life oh
cleared away superb defending massive
credit delivered into the area here
clears it
away
lindegard chance to run at
them early ball
in really good buildup but no end
product
[Applause]
diabat
but promising looking
ball the cross didn't beat the first man
and it's gone behind for the
[Applause]
corner they favored a short one
here as ice for goal well it really
looked as though that was going to be
another goal from him well a chance for
second there probably should have done a
bit better there
really oh the counter chance looks very
real that needs an accurate cross
insufficient guile on the crossing front
you've got to
say and good width from snakes
here well didn't go to plan in the end
and the advantage acru to the attacking
[Applause]
side
fail could be threatening but not quite
what was needed I really thought they
were going to open up the
[Applause]
defense
stopped a certain and
goal
Massie nice looking
pass Crossing into the middle struggling
to get it
away can he find the net oh that's
textbook
goalkeeping
can he deliver it with
accuracy and No Nonsense defensive
clearance how can they nudge in front
later on here well nothing comes of it
it looked
promising
took a really smart piece of Defending
to stop
them now maybe room here for the
Counterattack all at all a broken
[Applause]
Counterattack
lindgard oh nice ball over the
top dangerous ball
a decisive clearance it
was nicely timed
tackle and so into the final 5
minutes Crossing
possibilities well the cross that time
completely
overcooked well the atmosphere is so
tense inside this Stadium but can they
find that moment of magic to win this
game the crowd certainly think so just
listen to them
well doesn't have to do it on her
[Applause]
own can he make it count well the keeper
is Happy the ball was there and a goal
at this stage of the game it might be
decisive and just look at their
supporters and that is going to be that
well a tale of Woe in terms of the score
line
lost concentration late on and it's cost
them dearly they'll need to get over
that
[Applause]
quickly
the prize today is considerable win the
game and make it through to the
promotion match a big test of every
player's
[Applause]
character stay tuned it's
live
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be enrolling I'm Derek
Ray at the microphone and joining me for
match commentary is Stuart Robson and if
things go well for them they can qualify
for a promotion match what do you
anticipate seeing Stuart well Derek it's
certainly in their hands if they win
here a promotion match will be theirs
they just need to put in a good
performance it won't be easy
though and a good looking
pass much to be admired about that
approach to
goalkeeping and passing it
well and he keeps
going
baale k
plenty of
options now with
Bruno
Diaz Bruno promising pass and you need
your Defender to take
charge well it works like this breaking
the club's goal scoring record brings
you attention yeah what a great
achievement but he won't want to stop
there he loves scoring goals and I'm
sure there's a lot more to come from him
including a couple more
[Applause]
today now with
Bruno
Diaz we saw the situation
developing good through
[Applause]
ball Bruno
and he's lost custody of the ball here a
magnificent stop well it should be a
goal but take nothing away from the
keeper that's a brilliant
[Applause]
save and he's fired over the corner
another keeper dealt with the danger and
efficient
defending
well just a bit too much on the pass and
as will be a goalkeeper's
[Applause]
balli oh great vision Jenn at the
off that's someone to play it to and
Deni by The Keeper
[Applause]
impressive
[Applause]
favoring the short one now let's see
about the
cross appear to be in two
mins can he put them in front yes is the
emphatic answer and you have to say it
was on the
cards well back underway and one n it is
let's see what happens
next
Diaz
lindegard this looks promising out
wide and a decent
delivery well let's give him credit for
trying it but the execution left a bit
to be desired Stuart well I think the
idea was right unfortunately the skill
wasn't it's well off Target in the
[Music]
end
and the referee Blows the Whistle it is
a free
[Applause]
kick oh lovely
ball oh you don't want to lose the ball
in that position and he finds the net he
could hardly
Miss
so the ball rolling again 2- n the
[Applause]
score
lindegard Running With The Ball
confidently that's a well struck
pass delivered into the
[Applause]
box well it did look promising but no
threat in the
[Applause]
end Now options are plenty crossed into
the penalty
area and cleared
[Applause]
away Palmer with
it and Hazard on the ball well that one
has promise and that's very intelligent
play to win back
possession Crossing
possibilities oh last ditch defending at
its very
[Applause]
[Applause]
finest let see about the delivery well
it has come to
[Applause]
nothing this is
Bruno
Pino
Diaz
lindgard so nearing the break here and
it's not going to plan at all for the
visitors we have to be honest Stuart
your thoughts well they've struggled in
this first half they've been outf out
plate and outrun they need to improve
all aspects of their play in the second
half if they're to get back in this
one
[Applause]
lindgard not a successful intervention
winning the ball
[Applause]
back that's a good
pass oh body in the way
crucially this might be ideal for the
counter well they have to pay attention
all and all a broken
Counterattack and he's got the clatter
at
clear over the touch line for a throw
[Applause]
in
and the fourth official confirming that
we'll have one additional
minute and there it is the halim
[Applause]
whistle
[Applause]
the
so back in business and un very much on
top of their game so far so let's see
how the second 45 plays
[Applause]
out
oh what a top Dodge pass just needs to
stay calm and son on the volley well if
be frustrated with that finish that was
a big opportunity
there
Diaz
lindgard a lot of space to
attack throw in's
[Applause]
given chance to
[Applause]
cross foul there free kick
[Applause]
awarded
that's a nice looking
ball managed to get it out of
there oh great
vision and really tried to blast that
one past the keeper but his radar was a
bit
[Applause]
off Sans superb looking
pass
they've given it
[Applause]
away
lindegard can they do something positive
on the
Counterattack they need to get bodies
back well goal kick just as it was
looking
promising
unable to keep the ball un moving it
with purpose good looking cross not away
completely oh that's a super piece of
Defending well offside here Such a Pity
for them chance was
on so a half an hour
remaining
lindgard could be a chance to break
here a disappointing end to the
[Applause]
move Costa with
[Applause]
it oh he's given the ball
away
[Applause]
and unable to keep
[Applause]
possession promising possession this
he's got to score oh yes it's gone in
and now a chance for them to Revel in
the
moment so on they go again and unor
really cantering to Victory
now
[Applause]
Kang decent progress with the ball at
his feet he got in the way of that
[Applause]
cross really good buildup but no end
[Applause]
product 20 minutes to go in this one
might work out offside the
decision
Diaz Ramos with it oh nice
[Applause]
ball real chance what a vital
[Applause]
intervention Azar has it oh they have it
again well the referee wasn't going to
let that
[Applause]
go and take it
away wonderful chance and it's a double
for him in this game no way for the
opposition to contain him and no wonder
he's off
celebrating and danger revers it well
read little space for them here no
spillage from the goalkeeper
routine but it could run onto it
here
took a really smart piece of Defending
to stop
them
aaman
lindegard and threading it
through but a crucial intervention
inside the
box and that's gone out of play for what
will be a goal
kick
extremely sloppy in possession oh what a
top doch pass real defensive
resilience now the Counterattack looks
on just straying
offside good
pass great
block now doesn't get away with it free
kick
[Applause]
given
Bale now with
Bruno and a good challenge to bring that
attack to an
end
promising
pass pressing like that will help the
[Applause]
cause we will have a couple of
additional minutes at the end here oh
what an
opportunity surley and rattling the
post reading it
well crucial intervention just then amid
impending
danger and that is the end of the
contest and not the happy outcome as far
as the
[Applause]
[Applause]
visitors
for
a crucial day stands in front of them
the knowledge that a win is required to
make it through to the promotion match
and no doubt about it their opponents
won't be of a mind to do them any favors
at
all we're live on
eatv
[Applause]
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be enrolling I'm Derek
Ray and my comment partner here on the
Gantry is the former Arsenal and West
Ham player Stuart Robson and if things
go well for them they can qualify for a
promotion match Stuart your expectations
well Derek a win here and they will get
themselves a promotion match they just
need to keep their nerve and put in a
decent
[Applause]
performance really nice
ball is it going to be and a goal just
what the fans wanted to see the ideal
way to
begin
[Applause]
now back underway and one n it is let's
see what happens
next
Diaz this is Bruno and the advantage
acru to the attacking
side winning back
possession well there was never any
doubt we were always going to be
highlighting him after his exploits in
the last match breaking the club's goal
scoring record well as you mentioned the
record was broken last time out but
expect more today this is a player
that's hungry for goals and has the
ability to keep scoring
them pressure applied can they make
something of it and just losing control
of the ball and it will be a throw
in
[Applause]
that's a good looking ball and steered
back under a bit of
[Applause]
pressure wose came away with
it and that is
[Applause]
offside
[Applause]
this is
Bruno good ball over the
top well showing excellent judgment to
intercept the fans are shouting
[Applause]
shoot trying to really get at the
opposition here
here magnificent
defending this could Square the game and
that's exactly what has transpired now
that could be a massive turning point
and momentum is with
them it is to be a throw
[Applause]
in
[Applause]
pishi very quick thinking
there oh you don't want to lose the ball
in that position well she has called the
play back and it will be a free
Kick
K this could be Troublesome and he's a
apparently veered into an offside
position Stuart well that's tight really
tight but he was just too anxious to
make his run he was in
though and winning it
back
lindgard here's
[Applause]
Ramos
Diaz
Pino he has gone over the touch line for
what'll be a throw
in well that wasn't part of the plan was
it giving the ball away like
that and still looking for
space Oh blocked
[Applause]
it
moving the ball more than decently but
can they take the lead cutting the ball
back well that one has
promise an alert piece of
Defending
Akerman good waight on that
pass well good eff of
pressure and this might not be the ideal
situation for them and a penalty awarded
spot kick coming
[Applause]
up
this to give them the
advantage and that is when you need your
goalkeeper he's driven in the corner did
his job
defensively
now with
Bruno
lindegard The Defenders know they need
to get
tighter
Diaz wose have it
back Distributing it
well can he take the chance oh denied by
the post well the keeper have plenty to
think about with bodies around
him well they're certainly getting
closer you just sense that the goal is
coming they're playing so well at the
moment just the challenge that was
required plenty of supports
here well disappointing end to the
move well there was impending danger but
good
defending one minutes of stoppage time
has been added
on nice looking can they Forge
ahead that is that for the first half
[Applause]
[Music]
here
[Applause]
so they get the ball rolling in the
second half even Steven here so little
to choose between the
sides defensive Brazilians to shut them
down well on you go says the referee
advantage and Wanderer is in possession
again
well the bar can be the goalkeeper's
best friend and a goal to reestablish
their advantage just look at the
celebrations
Bruno dangerous looking through ball and
Beyond the last Defender
[Applause]
offside
and quick thinking
[Applause]
defensively
Bale onto
Bruno poor
pass this could be
Troublesome can they cover up
well able to survive that attacking
push Now options are
plenty but nothing comes of
it this could be the equalizer looked
like a certain goal but that's a great
challenge wers could be on to
something must score well the challenge
he's gone and find the net milant piece
of finishing magnificent
[Applause]
goal so the ball is moving again we've
been treated to four goals 3-1 the
score this is Bruno from a long way out
foul there free kick
awarded into the final half
hour tremendous intuition to win it back
oh good
Vision a good and fair challenge
[Applause]
opportunity and back with
Kang well they're on the scent of
something
positive on the ball Ramos a possibility
is inside the Box chance here not to be
and still chasing this game well that
was the chance to get back into this as
it is they're going to struggle
now
Jin making sure nothing came of
it a tremendous Vision crossed into the
penalty area and he's clear as
[Applause]
lines textbook closed cling down and now
they're on the attack and running in
behind a goal and it's very much game on
here underway again and we're being
treated to plenty of goals 3-2 at the
moment well that's really strong play to
keep hold of the ball well Advantage
coming into play and rightly
so p
plenty of players waiting in the
[Applause]
middle well trailing but plenty of time
left and a corner coming
up well just listen to the fans they
know this is a big chance
here and there's the delivery
well the header was too high but it was
[Music]
[Applause]
close
you now he must favor the
cross really well
positioned and maybe scope for Wanderers
to add to their advantage with this set
piece
[Applause]
corner kick played in well desperately
close to going in that
[Applause]
time
lindgard another referee allowing
advantage to acrw to them
and unable to keep
possession well the fans are certainly
playing their part here just listen to
this
noise oh an incredible clearance I must
say I didn't see that
coming well this leg Corner could
represent their last chance to
equalize oh super for header but the
goalkeeper was up to the task another
corner kick conceded let's see what they
do this
[Music]
time and he clears it out of Harm's
Way Now counter attacking
possibilities well she has called the
play back and it will be a free
[Applause]
kick
well I think the fans are doing
everything they can to get their team
back into this but can they find that
moment of inspiration and get an
equalizer well late in the game here
they know what they need and that's an
equalizer not quite the cross he was
hoping for an alert
[Applause]
intervention could be
dangerous almost found its Target but
cutting it out in the
[Applause]
end well the counter chance looks very
real well just overdoing it and clears
his
[Applause]
lines that's a lovely
ball and take it
away
oh that's a really good
run could be and a goal that's his brace
they just can't keep him
quiet and there goes the final whistle
it's gone the wrong way as far as the
home fans are concerned well Derek they
were certainly off the pace today beaten
to the ball in
two
[Applause]
to
for
