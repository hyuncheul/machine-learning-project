no big presentation but it's fine okay
here we
go tomorrow is a
hope never a promise
Kindred
okay trir fighting some Winters
[Music]
claw
okay is
that is that where GH and
kale this is oh this is like them before
this is them in the
past when they each have the sword this
is them fighting
together oh that's
[Music]
sick
behind yeah this is like ancient demasia
oh that's
[Music]
badass Jesus atrox is
huge
is okay the music's
hype hey
IIA
who
[Music]
that Wukong he's got got a lot
of do have a bow
staff or is
this is that
yasua
[Music]
no what is is this old man Yas so what
is this wait
what yeah so how' you get so old it's
kind of cool
though is it Yo's Master it might
be
oh that's cool that labs in the back
oh what wolf with legs what the
heck
this is sick
though oh Ash comes to his
rescue oh new Ash design
oh look at all those Furs on her
coat okay that was pretty
sick that was pretty awesome
dude I think the call was still yeah the
call definitely got me but that was that
was good the music was really
hype the old man yaso definitely put
aler box back old
like the thing is old man
Yasuo this might
be like it could be yasuo's Master but
the reason why I'm like speculating it's
old man yaso is because this is 100% kin
Morana in the past right right this is
back when they were actually fighting
together they wielded each part of their
mother's
sword so this is like in so like I'm
thinking this is in the
past and then yaso is in the
future and then this is in the present
with trendir
Nash yeah he has the scar that's why I
was like I'm wondering who this is but
he has the scars I'm like is this Yasuo
he's too old to be Yasuo
but it might it might be Master s but
like he's dead
hello d i dud and there's a whole bunch
of redesigns
too wait RI did say we're getting more
lore skins right suo die already 10 out
of
10 f for life thank you for the prim C
out they were the prime as well mention
law skins this year could that be these
k/m Morana design yeah like kale Morana
like past kale Morana future
Yasuo Ash
redesign nature
surprise Su I think with the prime as
well thank you maybe use this visual B
uh visual to base Morana maybe but it's
it doesn't look like the Morana one from
uh L cuz this Morana looks a lot more
battle
ready right like look all the armor
plating and stuff she has they they both
look a lot more armored
up
hello bye Haber thank for that 26 months
over two years Jesus Christ thank you
yeah and Kindred was in
there what if kale were gone I'll send
no it couldn't be because they're both
using the sword where did that come from
the whole thing is that kale y the other
swally when neosia was established yeah
cuz like look how look how much more
wooden stuff there is in damasi it's
clearly not as
developed let's go over two
years yeah oh yeah also Morana was
flying right Morana doesn't fly
anymore her wings aren't bound this is
definitely them in the
past I'm thinking like this is in the
past and then trir is in the present
they deserved and they looked fan
[ __ ] tastic yeah I really like the
idea that trir is constantly
knew how to take over a host when kale
and Morana were both still defending
Deasia yeah I mean atrox has been
revived a ton of times and unlike him
being revived as a new thing like nefi
he's done it you know like hundreds of
times at this
point he jump and call with nekr this
time if he'd like
to if he would like to I'm down did but
that's up to him why did it look like it
hurt for morg to use her powers
I mean it kind of does she like her
whole thing's about like I'll show them
pain I don't
know Tren easily clears Kindred in game
yeah I mean in game yeah but I really
like the idea that every time trir is
like this close to death he has to fight
off
wolf which is awesome also they actually
made look how big wolf is holy [ __ ]
Wolf's enormous that's exactly how big
he should be this time
too
uh where did that come from
if TRS will pop up throughout history
never going
away where did that pretty cool I like
the attention to detail Kindred stopped
hunting trendir one sash saved him yeah
where did that come from kind of neat
wolf looking like an actual wolf and not
just smoke blob is so cool yeah well he
still looks very ethereal right you
[ __ ] piece of [ __ ] I like how lamb
also just kind of watches it happen you
know like he's still fighting lamb but
lamb isn't really doing as much like
wolf is going after him cuz you know
trir is resisting death so it makes more
sense that wolf would be the more
integral part of trying to take him
down the music was so hype as
well hey it's I was very pleased with
that aspect of it did Mor not drop the
sword and then Gil picked it up to do
her big Slap Attack yeah she did also a
new Ash design
dude where where we get the full shot
look at all those
Furs she looks so much better look at
the cool a it looks so much
better she still looks like ash as well
Ash next a you like yeah this is a
wonderful
Improvement look at
that so much
better see you wife calm down no
die old manaso seeing kindred's arrow
and accepting it I am still yeah I'm
very confused by what this means with
man y the K show V Catlin Kindred ILO y
your favorite but I didn't expect oo
getting there in a promo art all so can
we watch it again smile in the Pro is
there new season start proo
art hello say my wife no kill
one oh so there
is I can see a very cropped version of
it in the end
I didn't see it I probably need to just
like go and watch it instead from the
stream yeah here we
go from
here
oh hello wow yeah
elaoi let's go elaoi and Kindred Kindred
front and center where did that God damn
I'm a SC at all if this isnu do to being
like grade we might get a third win
chitter in the form of his master that
was supposedly Dead Master oh yeah we
get master s old man Yasuo might be them
wanting to do o where Champions are
older versions of themselves with more
expanded LP for skin yeah hello yeah
it's just cuz this it he has the scar he
has the ponytail he has the wind powers
he has the sword I've got two thumbs and
in all regard it looks like Yas about if
you say my name correctly because for a
sky and sad it right and for B cinematic
was Godly n you [ __ ] I like jurass
are thank you for the nine months I can
never say it right but you know one of
these days maybe maybe May the N mon
though yeah that that was
great I I really enjoyed that I the call
was just so like the call was like a 15
out of 10 but this was still like a 10
out of 10 this was
awesome I want to watch it just in full
again you guys just want to watch it in
full again hello that was good music was
hype I I really liked
it I just want to hear the music again
oh hello never promise the animation was
really nice
too
hello
hello I like how he can see that's
that's either Ash or K I think that's
Ash like he sees Ash coming to his
rescue why is morg fighting with kale
cuz this is definitely them in the past
because morg and kale used to fight
alongside each other that's why morg has
one half of the sword cuz they were
twins their Twin Sisters of the aspect
of justice and that's like a very old
Deasia and Mor's Wings aren't bad here
so this is definitely them in the
past fighting atrox atrox looks great
[Music]
too this whole cinematic looks to be in
the past no this is definitely way in
the past and then yaso have no
idea but the trir one definitely looks
more in the present cuz they're you know
and Asher
together the a heart beating on atro's
sword as
well cuz the music is really hype
though yeah the music gives me chills a
bit W where did that come from hold up
to do atro's hands match since I thought
the reason I thought his hands were
different was because panion cut it off
in his story that's there's a good point
are his hands no one's still definitely
larger this one's still definitely a lot
larger where did that come
from this his ass c d at yeah atrox
looks sick I mean all the Champions look
sick I'm still so confused by old man
[Music]
Yasuo like it's definitely
[Music]
Yasuo he's got the sword SA hairstyle
same
scar apocalyptic future iion yeah yeah I
don't
know going zero T I see oh
yes nck you [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] yeah
the hair is the same isn't that Kush no
kuso is probably kingu there's no
connection to
Yasuo yeah he has the scar did you see
the eyes I didn't see that was was
[Laughter]
there there's wolf over there okay
that's pretty sick yeah there's wolf
back there oh that's so
sick
oh and kindred's arrow oh [ __ ] so it's
like him like fighting it off and then
accepting
it he's like so this is like the end of
yaso like he accepted his so it can't be
it can't be Master some someone's
dead Yasuo canonically dead let's go I
don't this raises so many
questions
where did that come from yes best
cinematic Yasuo
exad can we all agree as well uh
trendir looks so much better without his
stupid ass
helmet I feel like he looks infinitely
better without his dumbass
helmet yeah like he looks way better
now something something silhouette I
don't even know of
it bro almost killed
death
I that's such a cool
detail that's so neat that that lamb
stops firing her it's like no he's
fighting for his life he's going to make
it cuz really kenon is just doing their
job
right they don't have biases they're
just doing their
job hello yeah L's like yeah not this
time like you escaped us this time
is CH not the first person to I mean you
know people who cheat death for sure you
know probably uh atrox is like that
atrox cheats death wifey came to the
rescue
yeah
wife help me I'm still
nature
K so yeah and she looks a lot better too
where did
that wait does that
mean the
[Music]
ending maybe Ashen thank you for the
seven months as well thank
you yeah I didn't even what does her bow
look like I didn't even see
it it still looks about the
same those big ice
bow I think it's because it's such
higher detail it looks a lot more
convincingly like
ice the song name is I still here which
could mean something yeah it's very I
think that's also like a reference to
two Kindred right that like trendir is
holding on for his life so is atrox as
well I I can't get over what like old
man Yasuo
means like what is does this mean n you
[ __ ] piece of [ __ ] cuz this has to be
yasua who else could it be it has to be
like that's what I'm thinking it it has
to be because this is
present because you know Trin and Ash
are together so this is present and
yasua is in the future and then Kayla
morgana's in the past
right that that feels like a logical the
logical thing I se the video description
Hello
well that
explains
