um with that bias rolled in and being
like used in this calculation so you
know not ignored not compensated for
he's top 10% hardest to play Champions
now in three years will will he still be
top 10% I would guess probably still top
third top quarter um so he is a pretty
high Mastery Champion but um for example
Brier who's been out for a lot longer
actually observes a steeper Mastery
curve than uh than ha does though Bri
uh is I think going to probably remain
like top 5% in League of Legends for for
sharers Mastery Cur because she plays so
uniquely to other Champions that might
not end it being actually true but
that's kind of the thought right now uh
regardless kind of some thoughts on way
we can move on to next
