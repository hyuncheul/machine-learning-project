yeah
yeah I wake up my
days to
theow
down up down slam down with the ice like
rain 100 the lock up going up to me ver
the universe R we don't 100% the G
that's nothing whatever if y'all can't
work you
keep got to
tell
I all eyes on one man in fantastic form
and the top scorer in the league can he
add to his tally
today hello and welcome to a city that
many people regard as the gateway to the
Glorious Jurassic Coast Bournemouth I'm
Derek Ray and my commentary partner here
on the Gantry is the former Arsenal and
West Ham player Stuart Robson and very
much looking for forward to bringing you
action from the Premier League it's
Bournemouth up against Tottenham
hawkspur well Derek we can talk about
coaches and their methods but it's now
down to the players which ones are going
to stand out who will affect the game
and who will have the greater desire it
should be a cracking game
though
Moore and very depthly cut
[Applause]
out
and the starting 11 for Spurs ug laice
between the posts davinson Sanchez plays
alongside kidu kibali in central defense
Pierre emier plays with Rodrigo banur in
the center of Midfield and the idea is
to have just the one Striker up there
trying to pose problems for the
[Applause]
opposition
a was always luckely to the goalkeeper's
[Applause]
ball Benton
Cur it was a terrific result for Spurs
last time out against wolver Hampton
Wanderers how do you anticipate it going
this time Stuart well what a good 2-n
win that was particularly away from home
today I'm expecting a similar outcome
because they have that little bit of
extra quality it will be tight
[Applause]
though well for some teams there's a
drop off in performance when they play
away from home that hasn't been the case
with regard to Spurs you've got to say
Stuart well 15 wins from 17 away games
is magnificent it's their ability to
defend all over the pitch that's really
impressed me most setting traps stopping
the opposition play and forward not
letting crosses come into their box you
name it their defending has been
brilliant well the crowd know that set
pieces could be their best chance just
listen to that
[Applause]
reaction good work to win the ball back
high up the pitch this looks
interesting every goalkeeper would
expect to catch that
one
hiier galdo with
it Hunter read it superbly to take back
possession definitely look as though
they want to make this move
count
he went in so dangerously with that
tackle now the referee is the man
everyone's looking
at coming off the pitch number
21i to be replaced by number 33
delivered into the box and a Super
Header it looked as though it might be
going in well the crowd can sense the
goals coming could this be the
moment so the corner played into the box
not fantastic defending let's see if it
helps the
opposition he'll be breathing a sigh of
relief ball
one promising move from
Tottenham the cross is
on
hiier magnificent challenge to win it
back and now a corner coming
up
let's see about the delivery well no end
[Applause]
product valton Sanchez Bournemouth
recovering possession
[Applause]
well
[Applause]
hiier the high was very much
on can he put them in front oh crucial
tackle
[Applause]
brilliant
[Applause]
sessi
Mo
marcondes now they stopped them in their
tracks
wonderfully weighted
pass
banur good physical
play and a chance for them to nudge in
front and keeping it
out delivering
it and that is not going to help the
cause the header well Off the
Mark well at some point Tottenham have
to take one of these chances because
their buildup play deserve to see them
in front here as those stats tell us
they've carved out so many good
opportunities well real difficulty
keeping the
ball
[Applause]
aif
just failing to hit the target with his
pass and it'll be a throw
[Applause]
in
Hunter
son and H with
it
Benton still passing it around with
authority an effective
challenge well Spurs now in potentially
a dangerous position
banur he might be on to something great
reflex action well that should have been
a goal mind you it's a brilliant save
playing it in not really the ideal
[Applause]
clearance spot on with that
[Applause]
tackle constant maros
[Applause]
SAS and hir with
it and the referee Blows the Whistle the
first half is in the history books here
at the
vitality and
the
and so the second half gets underway
almost a case of the two teams saying to
each other whatever you can do I can do
just as
[Applause]
well getting
forward
and struggling to get the shot off oh
good work by The
[Applause]
Keeper can he deliver it with accuracy
and the problem not completely
solved Kung
minson just the challenge that was
[Applause]
required
well this is certainly the home of live
football eatv and looking forward to
bringing you more action from the
Premier League it's Bournemouth facing
Manchester
United the Press was on and it
worked teammates
[Applause]
available and with that the attack
Fizzles
[Applause]
out l
Kelly Thiago
Mendes Jefferson LMA no far from the
ideal
pass
hiier
hiier well that's how to keep the
opposition at
Bay
[Applause]
LMA
[Applause]
well there it is Spurs have controlled
The Possession but they haven't done
enough with it particularly in the
Midfield areas where their passing has
been far too safe and that needs to
change quickly if they're to win this
one well looking to put the ball to good
use
here and he might be through
here and a goal they've taken the lead
well playing a man short but that
doesn't seem to bother them we shouldn't
be surp
rised well here we can see it again look
at the way Glides past the defender to
create space for himself and his
movement so clever once he gets onto it
there's only one thought in his head
smash it as hard as possible what a good
goal substitution for back onway and one
n it is let see what happens
next to be replaced by number 14 Ian
perisic now who can he play it to
well nothing comes of it it looked
[Applause]
promising and a quick reminder we have
FA Cup semi-final action for you here on
eatv it's Tottenham Hotspur taking on
Liverpool well semi-finals are usually
great occasions and that's certainly
won't disappoint a place in the final
the reward for the
winners and I'm hearing the SE situation
has changed in the city game Alex CL has
going to tell us more it's his second
goal for Manchester City they're ahead
by two now with 68 minutes played Alex
keeping us right up to
[Applause]
date extremely sloppy in
[Applause]
possession 20 minutes to go in this
one
they're getting right on top of their
opponents and winning it back oh the
goalkeeper did well to hang on to that
one Benton
[Applause]
C Grimaldo lovely ball over the
top they couldn't quite must a real
threat surely
and it's two for him today a masterful
performance The Defenders unable to stop
it well that was a fairly easy finish in
the end but he still had to take it he
won't mind how they come
though so the ball rolling again at
two Rodrigo Ben 15 minutes left for play
number 18
LEL
hiier and showing fine
Vision oh a lovely
ball and still a
chance can he finish here well good
defending plattered out of
there kefir
Moore Jefferson
LMA excellent
Vision really vital interception
here well the final whistle approaching
and this has certainly been an away Day
to Remember Stuart your assessment well
I think the score line reflects the
difference between the two teams for
most of the game they've dictated the
play and they've created some really
good chances I think it's been an
[Applause]
performance
Mo now with Ryan
Christie he's protecting it
well
marcondes
LMA well read to put an end to that
attack well just hearing a goal has gone
in in the Arsenal game let's hear all
about it from Alex it's a third for
Liverpool they've extended their lead to
three with only a few minutes left to
play thank you
Alex and running it
[Applause]
back so one minute of stoppage time
that's what the officials have
said
Mo here's Thiago
Mendes marcondes and the referee says
that's going to do it for this contest
it is a Spurs success

[Music]
fore
[Music]
nerves are really jangling now just four
teams left in the FA Cup and the stage
is set now just the sort of weather you
would order on a trip to Wembley perfect
playing conditions in London today I'm
Derek Ray in the commentary position and
I'm joined for expert analysis by my
partner Stuart Robson and we have action
from the semi-final stage of the FA Cup
just moments away it is Liverpool up
against Tottenham hbur well what an
occasion this should be Derek two
excellent teams two top coaches a great
atmosphere and 90 minutes away from a
place in the Cup Final it should be a
classic having to take on the shot
simple catch
really so the starting lineup for
Liverpool Allison gets the n in goal
Trent Alexander Arnold plays with Andrew
Roberts in the wide defensive areas and
they line up with just the one Striker
looking to do a bit of
[Applause]
damage
Puma it's with chalano and Spurs moving
the ball with purpose but the danger
averted for
now well you can probably see why we're
focusing on this fellow as one to watch
Stewart in particular what do you expect
to see from him well Derek he's
certainly going to be the key player
today last time out he scored those two
goals but it his General play that was
outstanding getting on the ball making
things happen and he got his reward with
the brace and I'm expecting to see
exactly the same again
today and a good challenge to bring that
attack to an
end Luis
Diaz Salah might be able to set up the
chance there an effect of
clearance tremendous
[Applause]
block well timed
tackle oh that's an interesting
pass and the snuffing out of the Cross
[Applause]
there well that sound to beat your
opponent well he hit it with Authority
close
Hunter Eve bisa has it but a shocking
pass
really it's a good Liverpool move in the
making
Henderson
[Applause]
oh the keeper needed to do an awful lot
better
son
chanu out of play and a Spurs throw in
Forth
coming plenty of players waiting in the
middle
Salah did well to win the ball
back
chanu Galo with
[Applause]
it
mosala still on level terms moving the
ball
[Applause]
nicely and the throw in for
Liverpool and teammates to play it
to and firing it to the near
post well no damage
[Applause]
done and support available it might be
and keeping it
out
can he deliver it with accuracy not
messing around with that
clearance
Grimaldo
son Spurs now in potentially a dangerous
[Applause]
position
[Applause]
well nicely cut out now what can they do
with the
[Applause]
ball well no stopping
him
KUSI is it going to be and he read it
really well fine
save
[Applause]
trying to pick out a teammate well the
keeper won't be complaining about that
corner kick delivery his ball all the
way the attack continues they're making
considerable
progress will he play it
in
vuma really vital
interception well as you can see it's
been really tight and neither side has
taken enough risk going forward
hopefully that will change soon and then
we might get some
entertainment yes a stalemate so far
will it
[Applause]
continue
Hunter it's with
[Applause]
chalano and the ball's
gone
Alexander
Arnold now was Salah Splendid defending
and it needed to
be having to take on the shot and held
with ease by
laice well just one minute of time added
on for stoppages
here keeping possession of the ball with
authority Salah Ah that's high level
goalkeeping well that's a fantastic save
he's such a good
keeper trying to deliver it accurately
it hasn't come to very
much and with that the first half comes
to an end here at Wembley
[Applause]
Stadium
so
so back underway here into the second
[Applause]
half Splendid tackle and a throw in
coming
up getting in there to take it
away
chanu must take the lead here oh he's
been denied and they remain locked
together well that's a good save but
really he should have scored from there
that's a big chance and he's fired over
the corner well still an issue
here
chanu it's with
chanu is he going to put it away and the
keeper there to deal with
it
well no end
[Applause]
product he could pick out a
teammate
son
vuma excellent
defending at the semi-final stage of the
Europa League they first leg coming up
live on eatv it's Liverpool up against
Olympic Mar well I can't wait to see how
the coaches set their teams up for that
one both w a lead going into the second
leg and the James for Spurs at this
juncture another a short corner here
great
block and the Liverpool throw in fourth
coming
but he tried in vain to get himself back
on side well he needs to show greater
awareness there and hold on to the ball
a fraction
[Applause]
longer
KUSI now with Emerson showing a lot of
guile
there lost
[Applause]
possession
Luis
Diaz well what a game this has been so
much good attack in football between two
evenly matched teams this has been a
great watch so
far
Henderson Good visualization and
execution priority was to hang on to the
ball which he
did
[Applause]
well lovely work to get past as
man but no damage done that's the main
thing
Hunter
galdo chanu S and a goal the opening
statement in this semifinal how
important can that prove to
be
the Liverpool restart the game a wake up
call for them
[Applause]
perhaps
fabinho here is
Thiago they eyeing that final pass you
just
feel this could level it really sound
defending but it looked so threatening
but the danger
averted
chanu 20 minutes to go in this
one
galdo good work from Liverpool to make
sure possession changed
[Applause]
hands and the counter looks on here
options
available and it looked like open road
for them but up a dead end
Darwin
Nunes wonderfully weighted pass and that
is how to
block
Salah and the cross is immediately dealt
with a quarter of an hour remaining
here Dean
[Applause]
KUSI can he finish this oh incredible
save and he snuffed out any sign of
danger vigorous defending and reading it
absolutely
superbly and the Counterattack is on
options
available well they seem to be on to
something positive but it faded
away
Emerson
[Music]
[Applause]
chanu has to go and block for
now well both teams have had substitutes
swming up and now both will rely on
their respective benches trying to pick
out a teammate couldn't quite hang on
and it's in a two goal cushion and just
look at these fans they now believe that
a trip to the final is theirs
[Applause]
so back underway from the score line

to be replaced by number 34 Clem

little bit
longer
mosala and they know they need to stop
