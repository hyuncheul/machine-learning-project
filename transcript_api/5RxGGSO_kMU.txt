[Applause]
and that for me is the area that's key
[Applause]
today and so the match is
[Applause]
underway
Özil
Jong
it did look on for them but not to
be James with
it well the flag has gone up here
offside it
is good ball over the
top and possibilities Inside the
Box clears it
away Top Class
[Applause]
defending
Özil Campbell with
it
[Applause]
Özil oh moving it
nicely might take the lead and the
penalty has been given
here well there might have been a case
for a yellow card but the referee didn't
see it that way well Derek and it's come
off the
keeper well they can keep possession of
it
now
B
Bale plenty of options oh surely and by
a away for thin margin
offside
re
Özil Reed now
a good Vision
there oh it comes to nothing in the end
really should have made more of
that in possession
[Applause]
schz
[Music]
Bale what can they do to stop him
running at them
[Applause]
could be threatening oh magnificent from
The Keeper fantastic
[Applause]
stop trying to deliver it
accurately well no danger
[Applause]
now
Özil and a timely
[Applause]
intervention
vidit for
strata well he's lost the
[Applause]
ball
still passing it around with
[Applause]
authority well doesn't have to do it on
her
[Applause]
own chance for him to get in behind
maybe what a genuine opportunity but it
was squandered go
kick
mialik beeding it
through oh that's textbook
goalkeeping and a chance for him on the
flank oh that's a super piece of
[Applause]
Defending
perea
mialik targets available cross comes in
well it still could be
dangerous now defense of resilience
there Campbell on the
[Applause]
ball
Cavani readed now well that one has
promise and unable to keep the
[Applause]
ball
and the referee playing
Advantage
Reed Campbell on the
ball
Özil and it's a quality
pass really good buildup but no end
[Applause]
product
[Applause]
mik and a chance to whip it in
here into the advanced
position and there it breaks down but
credit to the
defense and there it is the halim
whistle
sh
[Applause]
well they've got things going again here
and I wonder what kind of second half we
have in store for us
[Applause]
Campbell on the
ball plenty of support
here oh it was a crucial
[Applause]
challenge really showing off as wide
range of passing
skills
defensive Brazilians to shut them
down well they might be able to launch a
Counterattack might go
ahead and a good take under duress
[Applause]
there
Özil
[Applause]
R might be able to get in behind the
defense well didn't go to plan in the
[Applause]
end Reed
[Applause]
now
Reed
Jong and credit you a good
intervention cross fired
over well chance perhaps and the keeper
diving to th him well they haven't
created too much lately but the fans
know this is a chance to take the lead
here over it comes clearance needed to
be
better well it came to nothing in the
end now in a more than decent
[Applause]
position
[Applause]
there's to win it
[Applause]
back plenty of supports
here and that is
offside that's not a bad
ball mopping up
defensively
Cavani good wait on that
pass moving the ball effectively can
they jump in front and a goal just when
we wondered if this might finish nil nil
there it is they in
front well just watch this again a
change of pace a change of Direction and
a decent finish that's a very good
[Applause]
goal
R
vidit well not giving him any Breathing
Room good use of
[Applause]
Advantage teammates in the middle
absolutely nothing wrong with the idea
but no end product
Tong good
defending well we're inside the final
quarter of an hour
now he has time to play it over and a
goal to increase their advantage to two
overall that little bit of a cushion now
it's all about keeping the
concentration well here's the replay and
it's a really inviting ball played into
the box begging players to attack it and
then what a great finish as well good
connection with the ball leaving the
keeper with little chance it's a great
goal James
now oh he's lost possession and passing
it
through full marks to the keeper well
what a reaction from the goalkeeper so
such a good save in the
end who can he pick out and a goal if
there were any remaining doubts that
will settle the
[Applause]
issue well if there were any lingering
doubts about the outcome surely they now
have been
removed
vidit couldn't find a teammate throw in
here well they couldn't keep
it oh that one has promise and offside
[Applause]
unfortunately
getting in there to
intercept good
distribution emphasis on the clearance a
good
[Applause]
one untiy in
possession oh nice ball
cross into the penalty
area and there it is she's only gone and
made it a
hattick well here's the replay and it
all starts off with that cross into the
box just begging for a teammate to get
on the end of it and then just look at
this finish Dereck she does so well to
read the bounce often you can send these
into Rose Zed but perfect contact and a
stunning goal really couldn't keep the
ball and that it's a
[Applause]
corner played over well it has come to
nothing and there it breaks down but
credit to the
defense really good strong tackle and
it'll be a throw
in L to attack from the wide
areas well he really read that
brilliantly and there goes the final
whistle and the home fans are going to
be happy about this outcome well it was
a very assured performance wasn't it I
was particularly impressed with their
play going forward really Lively almost
cutting through it will at
[Applause]
[Applause]
times
everyone on tenter hooks you can feel
the tension because there's so much on
the line if they win they make it true
to the promotion match it is that simple
they good evening and
welcome
I
a crucial day stands in front of them
the knowledge that a win is required to
make it through to the promotion match
and no doubt about it their opponents
won't be of a mind to do them any favors
at
[Applause]
all next on EA
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
TV and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be enrolling my
name is ER Ray and sitting alongside me
ready to provide all the analysis is
Stuart Robson and the Chance is on for
them to reserve for themselves a
promotion match Place how's it going to
go Stuart well thanks Derek what a game
we have in store here the motivation
couldn't be any higher a win here and
they'll get themselves a promotion could
be oh that is a majestic goal voled home
with precision and style superbly
done so the ball rolling again with the
score line standing at 1
[Applause]
n
[Applause]
cbell
Jong well she was always going to be
highlighted after what she did in the
last match namely break the club's goals
scoring record and a goal another one
two in quick succession no wonder
they're
[Applause]
celebrating well here's the replay and
it's a really inviting ball played into
the box begging players to attack it and
it ends up with a fairly simple finish
certainly not much the goalkeeper can do
about
that
kibali yacobson
an example of how to
press chance to do
damage giving it a try and did just
enough
defensively very good
interception and room now out on the
flank delivering it into the box well In
fairness it wasn't the best of
[Applause]
headers cross fired over emphasis on the
clearance a good
[Applause]
one can he find the right pass well
nicely cut
[Applause]
out
neard yakobson superb looking pass flag
Rays for
[Applause]
offside Campbell on the ball herel
[Applause]
is she going to
[Applause]
score and the attacking options appear
plentiful that's a good ball and he's
clear as
lines and managed to cut it out it's a
good thing too
Reed
now Campbell well keeping hold of the
ball is what it's all about for
them Jong good use of
advantage
heril and possession lost
intercepted chance to attack using
wit but Ely defending when it
mattered Reed
[Applause]
now possession given away
unfortunately Crossing
possibilities Campbell on the
ball
Cavani a creative look about
[Applause]
this oh and a perfect ball now how about
this making sure nothing came of
it plenty of of support
[Applause]
here and the referee Blows the Whistle
it is a free
[Applause]
kick
[Applause]
well it didn't worry the
[Applause]
keeper
Özil well timed
tackle good use of Advantage by the
referee well the advantage didn't come
to very much hence the award of a free
kick by the
referee
inching towards the interval and it's
going with Home Advantage Stewart as
always very keen to get your take yeah
they're playing really well here they've
controlled the flow of the game they've
won their individual battles and they've
created numerous chances their only
problem in the second half could be
complacency but I can't see that
happening Reed now on the
offensive and space AC cross
it
and just wide of a Target goal kick well
I think the goalkeeper had it covered
but it was a decent effort
[Applause]
though and there's the feed into the box
marvelous anticipation and the keeper
taking it
cleanly
[Applause]
that is that for the first half
[Applause]
here
[Applause]
my
[Applause]
well as they get the ball rolling again
interesting to see how this second half
pans
out Distributing it well and Under
Pressure that was a fine
claim
a good Vision there and a decent
delivery and the cross comes to nothing
in the
end could cross it in
[Applause]
here it did look on for them but not to
be
[Applause]
well there's an example of how to press
high
[Applause]
up
Özil cell on the
[Applause]
ball
well the fans really want him to
shoot well that's the sign of a well
organized
[Applause]
defense
neard
well that's a tall order as they triy to
pull one back but the passing game might
help and the Counterattack is on options
available could be
Troublesome wasn't really difficult for
the goal keeper in the
end and easily cut out in the end
genuine chance
excellent
block can someone get on the end of
this oh a save right out of the top draw
Super
Stop
kibali oh and a perfect fall now how
about this nice looking move
and a goal not over just
yet so the ball is rolling again 21 the
score what's going to happen
next Campbell with
it realizing that it might be opening up
on the opposite
flank in the right place to cut out the
pass
good
movement well there's the pullback they
couldn't quite muster a real
[Applause]
threat 20 minutes
[Applause]
remaining
[Applause]
knard
well the Defenders know they need to get
tighter can't really allow runs like
that oh a goal level now the lead has
evaporated so back underway the game
having been squared at
22
Cavani and TI he
play
now good use of the
ball under no real pressure well what a
stop it was well I have to say that's a
magnificent save that's a top class
piece of
goalkeeping now sending it in
halfhearted
clearance threat over for now it
seems
Jacobson
options in the center cross
[Applause]
blocked well what a final few minutes we
have here and the fans are certainly
playing their part but can they take one
of these chances that come their way and
win this
[Applause]
game and a decent delivery it's given
him something to contemplate well no way
through a move of promise on the flank
trying to get onto the front foot with
the minutes ticking away really well
[Applause]
positioned
[Applause]
Jong Distributing it well
and a useful
cross and well positioned to
clear but it comes down to the final 5
[Applause]
minutes
ö well the host have dominated the fly
of the game in the last 15 minutes and
you just sense it's only a matter of
time before they score what would surely
be the
winner
nice waight on the pass and the flag has
gone up here offside the
[Applause]
decision in terms of added time a
minimum of 1 minute chance to play it in
and as a play it goes throw in coming up
here
and the referee brings this contest to
an end it certainly
[Applause]
was
it is a division match with so much on
the line and they know the target at
hand a draw or better and they'll make
it through to the promotion match but
can they do it with the pressure on
[Applause]
today we'll have the action on eatv
one of the great things about football
is that no one knows for sure what's
going to happen let's see what unfolds
here tonight I'm Derek Ray on the
commentary Gantry and delighted to be
joined as always by Stuart Robson and if
things go well for them they can qualify
for a promotion match Stuart how do you
see this one going well Derek it's
certainly in their hands if they can get
a draw here a promotion match will be
theirs they just need to put in a good
performance it won't be easy
though and young boys pushing forward
with options
[Applause]
available
three went in strongly to win the
ball
Jong Özil effective looking
pass moving the ball nicely looking for
that final
[Applause]
pass and the referee spoted the foul but
has played
Advantage aware of the threat solving
the problem
can he deliver it with accuracy and
swept out of
there
Maloney and plenty of space out wide for
young boys well no threat posed by the
[Applause]
cross re
now and good work from the young boys to
win the ball
[Applause]
back
her
three oh lovely weighted ball they might
be in ready to fire and the keeper
nowhere to be found not that he's
complaining well here it is again what a
ball that is over the top of the defense
it's weighted perfectly and then he's so
calm with a finish cor as you like to
round the keeper and he slopped it away
so nicely it's a really good
[Applause]
goal
CH
Maloney
[Applause]
Jin now play stopped it is a free
[Applause]
kick what can they do to stop him
running at
[Applause]
them he has time to play it over well
capable of a better clearance than
that determined
defending oh skipping
away fine cross into the
middle on a time for
coolheads well there's an example of how
to press high
up an alert piece of Defending
plenty of support
[Applause]
here
show a tremendous
Vision a struggle to keep the ball for
the young
[Applause]
boys what a magnificent pass
a smart stop
here he's driven in the corner and a
goal they're going to take some stopping
now two in front
here well here it is again it's a good
delivery from the corner and it ends up
with a fairly simple finish certainly
not much the goalkeeper can do about
[Applause]
that well made it look routine but read
it
[Applause]
well teammates
available eril and they continue to
advance and a lot of options
here and they'll get ready for the throw
in just cleared away in the nick of
[Applause]
time
Cavani decent looking
pass able to clear the danger at least
for now
doing well to win it back what can they
do from here oh this looks useful and it
might be an a goal this time applying
the Finishing Touch just what the doctor
ordered well here's the replay he's done
well to get his head up pick out a
teammate and then the 1 V one against
the keeper she just passes it into the
net that's a very good
goal
Sim
now
Rodriguez Maloney and the advantage acws
to the attacking
side
Jin and here's
[Applause]
Rodriguez
Maloney putting all their energy into
winning back
[Applause]
possession and a simple clearance a good
one what was the chance they could get
caught out on the break
[Applause]
here and the managers will now deliver
their halim team talks we're at the end
of 4
[Applause]
like
[Applause]
well back underway here and young boys
know they've got to show a big second
half
[Applause]
Improvement
[Applause]
cbell and now back with the
keeper aware of the threat solving the
problem promising
pass chance here well fantastic IC
reflex
action really clever
pressing and a significant block
following that
cross textbook defending Inside the
Box not to like about that
pass and quick thinking defensively
well that's a fine looking pass and what
a magical save it
[Applause]
[Applause]
was now sending is in and C here's the
[Applause]
danger good efforts here oh he's only
gone and burn the net what purity of
hits caught it absolutely
perfectly what can they do to stop him
running at them but a good piece of
Defending to bring it to an end well it
clearly was deflected so it will be
their throw in
[Applause]
plenty of players waiting in the
middle that's a useful
cross and the corner kick the referee's
[Applause]
verdict
who can he pick out making sure nothing
came of
it now can they counter
clinically and it's offside that was
very
close High pressing and good high
pressing ing being egged on by the
crowd really good ball
there well that's how to do it inside
your own penalty
area well as you can hear the fans think
that should have been a penalty but I'm
not
[Applause]
convinced very quick thinking
there
that's a good ball it comes to nothing
in the
[Applause]
end
Jong chance to attack using wit must be
oh magnificent save well he's just
pulled off a great save there what
reactions from the goalkeeper that
was who's going to get on the end of it
not away
completely
and a good challenge to bring that
attack to an end this might be the
perfect counterattacking
opportunity well they couldn't quite use
that break in the manner that they'd
hoped it's a
[Applause]
corner
let's see about the
delivery and I think the threat has been
averted well the outcome is a free kick
[Applause]
here cbell on the
ball
[Applause]
Cavani
Campbell with
it
Campbell
Cavani well nothing comes of the attack
when all is said and
done oh and a perfect ball now how about
this and there it breaks down but credit
to the
defense that's a highquality
pass my goodness that save fully
stretched he was one for his own
highlights
reel and he's fired over the corner but
he knew he had to get to the ball and he
did now perhaps they can counter from
here and the flag raised offside it
is heril
who can he pick
out oh big
opportunity opportunity still there wow
the post getting in the way there oh
incredible save and he snuffed out any
sign of
danger well that really would have
settled it just inches away from going
three goals
up
really good buildup but no end
[Applause]
product plenty of support here and after
the cross a tremendous
[Applause]
block
Maloney
Joe we've had the official word there
will be a minimum of two added
minutes
[Applause]
Jin
Maloney and now Rodriguez the referee
blows for full time it ends at a victory
for the home team no complaints from the
fans here well
[Applause]
fairly
there can be no denying it this is
crunch time the first promotion match
and no margin for error the players have
simply got to get it right out there on
the
[Applause]
pitch the action is next on
eatv
[Applause]
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be enrolling my name
is Derek Ray and sitting alongside me
ready to provide all the analysis is
Stuart Robson and a new experience for
them as they make their promotion match
debut Stuart how do you see this one
going well I've enjoyed watching them up
to this point but today will be tough
that's for sure they'll need to be at
their very best to win here I
think Reed
now could be
threatening magnificent
defending over the touch line for a
throw
in
well the fans want to see a shot is it
going to be oh good
save well nothing comes of
it well so close to getting that early
goal there but it was a wonderful Save
By The Keeper you have to
say and the shot foiling his opponent
completely nicely cut
out always was going to be the
goalkeeper's ball
working so hard to win back
possession oh good Vision oh just miss
time this run and the flag going
up
cbell and that was a very fine
read and passing it
through making sure nothing came of
[Applause]
it
Cavani
Campbell
Özil Reed now perfectly positioned to
take it
away plenty of supports
here that's a good looking
ball pivotal moment defensively and the
penalty has been given
here
[Applause]
this to open the scoring here a goal
accurate from the
sport so underway again here one n the
score and he takes it
away
chance to play it in in position oh did
so well to deny
[Applause]
him well that save could be the Turning
Point here because they've been second
best all over the pitch up to now well
they can't exhale just yet here they
come again oh good save excellent header
he's having quite the game for himself
save after save after
[Applause]
save and flag raised offside well that
was always going to be offside he just
needed to hold on to the ball that
little bit
longer just lost his Focus throw in
here and given away
and playing it
[Applause]
through still looking for
space the cross was very much on but not
the end result they were hoping
for well he has players waiting at the
back post not the best
clearance well no damage
done
R it well and teammates around
[Applause]
him Marley now they have possession in a
good area of the
pitch oh it was close but he's put it
over
doing well to win it back what can they
do from
here now he must favor the
cross really showing off his wide range
of passing
skills
so almost at halime and they are making
good use of Home Advantage still a bit
of work to do though Stuart your
thoughts on what you've seen yes they're
defended really well all over the pitch
their work rate and discipline has been
excellent but any drop in Tempo and this
lead could easily slip
away and they'll get ready for the throw
in Marin
using his physical strength to Shield
it who can he pick
[Applause]
out well there it is the halime whistle
and that's going to
be
[Applause]
[Music]
w
well as they get the ball rolling again
interesting to see how this second half
pans
out a really single-minded piece of
Defending to make sure nothing unto
happen
[Applause]
happen well that one has
promise thumps
clear that's a highquality
pass and a goal they've added to the
lead much needed
[Applause]
security
well we can see it again now and it all
starts with the pass over the top it
takes out so many Defenders and then the
Finish is fairly simple in the end
that's a good
goal useful looking position you've got
to say could
be oh a stab piece of
Defending and he could be in proper
trouble here well trying to plot a route
back into the game but that does not
help their cause well they needed to
take this chance just to give them some
hope
[Applause]
here Campbell on the
ball
Jong he's beaten his man but a good
piece of tidying
[Applause]
up the cross is
on
Kane that is how to keep it out of the
net and a throw in fourth
coming possession
one
Cavani
can they hit on the break beautiful pass
and an example of a Counterattack that
went
nowhere
[Applause]
Reed he has time to play us
over must be oh the threat was there but
she's offside
[Applause]
apparently
couldn't hang on to
it
[Music]
Reed Jong and fed
forwards nothing comes of the attack
when all is said and done oh surely and
you can't canot argue with a hattick
simply Unstoppable
today well just look at this again great
technique good accuracy and enough power
to beat the keeper that's an excellent
goal this is looking rather comfortable
for them 3
n
[Applause]
Jack and there it breaks down but credit
to the defense
bodies forward and the break looks
on can they take advantage of the
situation oh that's a super piece of
Defending crucial piece of
Defending
Chong
and it cross the touch line so a throw
in
[Applause]
here
Özil
[Applause]
Jong
[Applause]
well we're inside the final quarter of
an hour
[Applause]
now Marley and losing possession
now can he get on the end of this one
what a lovely strike lethal piece of
finishing drilled home with true
conviction tremendous
goal and this is turning into something
of a route
4-0 and the ball with
[Applause]
Jack real chance oh marvelous defending
to deny
[Applause]
him and teammates around
him the
delivery just wanted to get it out of
there well let's see what they have in
store for them on the
break have to pay attention defensively
looked like an effective Counterattack
but brilliant ly
red but it comes down to the final 5
[Applause]
minutes
Jong and the cross goes in well not
cleared away
completely and defensive play to be
applauded
[Applause]
exploiting the wide
area cutting it
back they've won back
possession crossed towards that far post
and a goal it's a finish of re real
class the referee blows for full time it
ends at a victory for the home team no
complaints from the fans here well it
was a very assured
[Applause]
performance
mission accomplished when last we saw
this gifted player when you enter the
history books it's a moment to drink in
and as officially speaking the club's
all-time leading scorer now every reason
to expect more attacking Excellence
[Music]
today the action is
live good evening and welcome head of
what should be a pulsating night of
football I'm Derek Ray ready to bring
you match commentary and alongside me is
Stuart Robson and delighted to be
bringing you club's match action Stuart
what are your expectations for today
thanks Derek as always this should be a
good game great atmosphere great
opportunity can they slot it
home and the move breaks
down
Cavani are getting the ball
forward and nicely over the
top struggling to keep the
[Applause]
ball Campbell with
[Applause]
it Özil this could be
[Music]
[Applause]
Troublesome well since they have the
ball the referee playing Advantage here
after the foul a chance to contemplate
what is next and perhaps a goal from
this free
[Applause]
kick oh terrific fre kick and how well
the keeper did to Parry it Corner
awarded
playing it in well it has come to
[Applause]
nothing well good run this now what can
he do with it but nothing comes of it
the high press was on and the Chan is
[Applause]
on it is to be a throw
[Applause]
in
[Applause]
Reed well a classic example of how to
intercept om
[Applause]
Ali
oh they have the ball once
more well making considerable progress
with the ball lot to like about that
pass so a throw in
[Applause]
here Campbell on the
ball there to win it
back had a chance to whip it in here and
the degree of difficulty wasn't all that
high in terms of the
[Applause]
save Reed
[Applause]
now and scope for them to produce
something
exciting that's a good looking
ball couldn't keep the
ball
[Applause]
possession given away
unfortunately
[Applause]
incisive pass and offside
[Applause]
unfortunately they've given it
away trying to really get at the
opposition
[Applause]
here he has time to play it
over
and a precise challenge just when it was
required element of and the opinion of
the referee that is a
penalty well he's avoided a booking but
the complaints continue and the keeper
denies them from the
spot can he deliver it with
accuracy
it has gone over the touch line for
what'll be a throw
in Reed
now
Özil well nicely cut out now what can
they do with the ball plenty of
options well it looks so promising but a
goal kicked the
outcome
[Applause]
moving the ball more than decently but
can they take the lead I just couldn't
play that decisive ball to put them
ahead well that his high level
goalkeeping well he's just pulled off a
great save there that's goalkeeping of
the highest quality I would
say Reed now
that's a lovely ball must take the lead
here and that's an excellent piece of
Defending to thwart
[Applause]
him feeding it through and the flag
raised offside it
[Applause]
is really closing him down there to take
it
away electing to cross into into the
center The Tackle completely mistimed
and you would expect a booking under the
circumstances well straight into the
meat of the penalty
area a very effective play and they
might be on to
something could be a chance to break
here oh and a perfect ball now how about
[Applause]
this
Ramsey has
it and plenty of scope to be creative in
that wide position well that's one for
them to pursue but he drifted into an
offside position when he just thought
about the pass for a fraction too long
and that's why it's
[Applause]
offside they might be able to get in now
what a lovely strike lethal piece of
finishing drilled home with true
conviction tremendous

italii
patient buildup at the
moment firing it in well the keeper is
Happy the bar was
there racing forward try to catch them
out well had that gone in they would be
incomplete oh hang on Stuart big chance
here can they slot it home oh tremendous
reflex action there from The Keeper well
he didn't have long to react did he but
that's a top class save I have to
say corner kick played
in and problem solved for
now

carve out the
equalizer a good Vision
there crossing
opportunity realizing that it might be
opening up on the opposite
flank nice waight on the

abusive language tolerated in the
stadium thank you lot to like about that
pass well made it look routine but read
it

idea and the deflection there before it
went over the by line going to be a
corner and there's the feed into the box
well to be blunt misfiring with the
header
[Applause]

promising well this could really is this
the moment oh my goodness he's caught
that so well a goal of the highest class
fantastic technique so in business once
more on the back of that very important
equalizer 1-1

go an alert
intervention trying to open up the
defense opportunity and that a piece of
goalkeeping you're going to see again
and again and again well the two sides
still locked together and a set piece a
corner can make all the difference the
vendor doing his
[Applause]
job he's driven in the
corner and the danger cleared rewarded
for that brilliant High
Press how can they nudge in front lays
on here and he's broken free and a goal
this is why we adore this game late
drama and now they're in
front and passing it
well well gifting away
possession and support available good
distribution and it's gone behind for
the
corner trying to deliver it
accurately smuggled away
counterattacking very much an
option a switch of play

inviting someone to attack it and then
what a great finish as well good
connection with the ball leaving the

and this is turning into something of a
route

of this really good buildup but no end

useful well but all was said and done
he's failed to hit the
[Applause]
target
Jong

to but options at the back post here and
you've just witnessed a moment of truly
high class goalkeeping you're absolutely
