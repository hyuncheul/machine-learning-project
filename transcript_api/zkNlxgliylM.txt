Guys, I'm not a regular TF, I'm
a bit of a support TF. I 'm going
to Shurelia.
It's hard to say that I'm in the mindset of
just throwing goal
cards with Shurelia and a high-powered gun
. But , wait a minute,
but now that I think about it, this has that buff, but
I don't think I'll go to Loa Uchu.
How do I get there?
Q You must avoid it at all costs.
How?
Like this!
Hey, guess what!
It's worth the nick, Xerath 9.
If you do this, you feel good.
The shoes came out.
If you do this, it will be easy to avoid Xerath's skills.
Ah, I'm missing something.
I should have caught
this without using the play,
but someone should have used the play anyway
(Situation where the opponent hits the void first)
Oh, wait a minute
, Golka disappeared?
Wow, why does it match so well?
Wow, you got this all right?
Ah, but did I use too much force?
Kabi
But didn’t you just catch the Golka bug?
Why did
Golka just disappear?
(Ally Rek'Sai, who immediately tries to use the dragon)
It's a bit unfortunate that the dragon was taken away, but
it 's
not bad. Wow~ This guy is a master. He's good until the end. Just
wait a minute.
I'm in big trouble.
Please stop me from going home again. But if this happens,
should I take another look?
Tell me,
it's nice
. Push quickly. Push quickly.
When you use gung, push quickly.
Aren't you using gung on me?
I'm sorry, I'll eat it deliciously.
The palace is a bit of a waste, but
if it's like this, I'll do some digging.
But it's not that bad, if it's like this, right?
(Rengar, the opponent who came in fearlessly)
Nice pldo was taken away, so
hold on well bro, what is it that
you can heal
?
It's not a bad decision to come to Xerath, is it?
nice!
It's okay to live, but what if it's like this?
This is a hundred defeat!
Moving isn’t bad, right?
Should I use a tell?
please!!!
Wow nice!
This is Tepeda friends
moving!
I'll avoid them all. Xeras,
one of them got hit.
If I avoid everything too much,
I'll show off because I don't have any humanity, right?
Isn’t this noticeable?
under! Isn’t this noticeable? Nice
, is this a onecom, am I???
(Embarrassed young man)
I guess I don’t have to use the palace?
Feel free to skip Maokai W
... What is the timing of purification?!
rime!!
(Baek pulls out a card and waits behind Nico)
I
'll eat it deliciously. Should I apologize
?
I'm not just looking at one person,
I'm looking at two guys
! Eat Baron!
trot!
I'm almost at level 4 in Mid.
Oh,
what do I do with the level 4 difference? Brother Xeras,
I'll be honest with you about this.
It's not a difference in skill,
it's just a difference in champion
(Young man who is crazy) Because he plays such a shit champion
(Baek is cold) Is this how the level difference is
here
? What? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No, I didn't even try to ride it.
No, I couldn't buy the item. I, no,
sorry,
no, no, I was shopping
and this Are you traveling? What is this?
You guys saw it, right?
I didn't even know I was there. Is this
okay? I'm shopping.
Does it make sense for this to burn?
Wait, Samira is here.
Hey, I can't ride this.
Ah~ If I rode this, it's a mad movie, but
I couldn't ride that.
Hey, no, what is 10 minutes of reuse?
Why don't I ride it? I'm
on my way to delivery.
But why are you going into the well?
Why don't you go into the well?
(Young man embarrassed by his own play)
I didn’t think of this,
did I get hit too much?
Am I going to die too?
ah!!! Is it a pike kill?
ah!!! I really knew!
Please pull it!
and! Drag this?
I really attracted you.
If you do this, you are subdued. Bro,
if you do this for 700 won, it is delicious!
Akali, please do the carry for me~
(Bak's breathing type 1 inhalation and exhalation)
I'll just do it twice!
No, but I'm a little excited now.
Let 's lower it a little bit.
Ah , the tempo
of this game is too fast
. (Akali got bitten while pushing the top alone)
Ah~ Just go up.
If this is enough, I'm satisfied. !
Tel Location Tel is good?
Azir, is there something wrong?
Why is the game like this
? It's so hard,
is it Baron? I'll hit the Baron!
Pingwa Ah, Pingwa, should I have bought it?
(Back trying to turn the tables while blocking the Baron)
Ah, my Baron, something is disappointing
(I'm worried about Evelyn's assassination)
I'm on my way, but will it work out?
There's Evelyn.
Let's throw away the side and just go through.
Win this 4:4. I'll cheer for you guys.
Isn't this a dive?
But it's an angle where it's too easy to dive,
bottom!
No, it's a waste.
(Baron) Do you hit it?
Why so fast?
Wow, why is it so fast?
Did you go up?
I'm Alistar!
It's Ali's palace, so how do you get a one-shot?
Aren't you being too picky with your partner?
I have to stop the bottom x3
Oh wait... shouldn't I have gone?
If there is a backdoor here, I will be pushed out of the 1:1 composition.
It is Akali vs. Fiora.
Can we stop this?
Let's wait for that first.
Let's safely wait for the suppressor.
I think I need to start walking.
What is it? what? No mana?!
Wow ,
I never even thought about
not having mana
. Really..
