does your aim look like this this is why
you miss holy it's because you're aiming
with your right hand as opposed to
aiming with your WD your aim comes from
your movement you're going to place your
Crosshair where it needs to be with your
right hand but we don't want to be
adjusting that much with the right hand
when you're taking this fight watch all
this raw adjustment you do you stand
still and you try to track him with your
mouse that's very inconsistent you could
have literally just moved to the right
with your D key and you would shot him
in the face no problem
