which video game voice acts better
valerant or OverWatch I'll fight anybody
I'll fight everybody your eyes deceive
you I love Genji so much but yodu just
sounds more passionate knock me down
I'll get right back up Che love the
Cavalry as much as I enjoy Phoenix
Tracer is too classic I have to pick her
they picked the wrong day to mess with
our world I'm an army of One Brimstone
is an icon but let's be honest he
doesn't even come close to Soldier I am
both Shield and sword I have my eye on
you this is incredibly tough and I
honestly can't pick between the two I'll
give it to both
