stadium pack to the rafters we can't ask

the players here in the Spanish capital
of Madrid we're at the my name is Derek
Ray and sitting alongside me in the
commentary box providing expert analysis
is Stuart Robson and with the game just
moments away now this really ought to be
a oh in with a
chance there it is a delightful start to
this match just what they were hoping
for so the action continues will there
be a quick response from

Menace oh Sur and he's gone for power so
close to finding the
net

[Applause]
Martinez high quality
[Applause]
defending Tony
K Jude
Bellingham given away by Real
Madrid
dearco Martinez and Inter might be able
to cash in here trying to open them up
and he's apparently veered into an
offside position Stewart well that's
tight really tight but he was just too
anxious to make his run he was in
though Jude
Bellingham clear foul but a real Madrid
Advantage well the Advantage wasn't
helping them and so now they get the
free
kick
valde will it be Splendid
[Applause]
defending well failure to keep the ball
by the
[Applause]
nurri
Rodrigo good
distribution well read to put an end to
that
attack and Beyond the last Defender
offside
Riga well still searching for The
Equalizer but not passing it anxiously
pressure applied can they make something
of
it
venio junr and a chance to level it well
good clean catch by The
Keeper
chanu another a successful intervention
winning the ball
[Applause]
back and attacking possibilities for the
n zri
surely blocked it
[Applause]
brilliantly well a death clearance
corner
[Applause]
conceded well what an opportunity but
really good defending you've got to say
well let's see what they have in store
for them on the
break can't back marvelous
[Applause]
anticipation
CR chance to cross oh th it there and
what a piece of Defending we've just
witnessed and passing it
through oh it's narrowly wide so
[Applause]
unlucky Tony
Cross the ball with Luka
Modric oh could be an opportunity here
really good
[Applause]
challenge
tuam and the referee spotted the foul
but has played advantage that's a good
looking ball
and it's gone in the teams separated by
two goals now you cannot say they don't
deserve
it so underway once more 2-n the lead
here
meny this is
[Applause]
cross
chanu and that's really well
[Applause]
read and the first half is in the
history books here at the
[Applause]
bernabo so the ball rolling again and r
left with a real mountain to climb in
the second
[Applause]
half an inability to keep hold of the
ball
there oh it was a crucial
[Applause]
challenge
could reduce the deficit and he does
there is hope for them despite the
adversity they suffer down
here well here we can see it again and
he does so well to skip Beyond The
Defender it just buys him that bit of
time to get his shot away that's a
really nice
goal on they go again and I wonder can
real push for a leveler
[Applause]
here
barela and he couldn't quite get himself
back on side Stewart well as a player
you need to be able to change your mind
but he wasn't able in with a
Chance well it's all going so swimmingly
for them here another goal and now it's
a matter of avoiding any silly
mistakes so on with the the action and
3-1 the score line at the
[Applause]
moment determined
[Applause]
defending
barela very quick thinking
there
[Applause]
Rodrigo it's with venicius
JR Real Madrid have given it
away
turam the ball with
martinez mikitarian
it did look on for them but not to
be
toam oh surely well in position to make
it a brace but not to be well he's
certainly been a threat in this game
he's looked so
Lively be impressed
here now breaking it Pace potential
Danger
out of play and an inter throw in coming
up
barela tuam it's a good inter move in
the making but quick thinking
defensively
turam barela can't miss
surely angles it
back
Martinez return to turam and he's gone
into an illegal position
[Applause]
unfortunately and it will be a free kick
to Real
Madrid time for the change
[Applause]
now 20 minutes to
go barela and offside it
is room to roam for the Minges
[Applause]
here looking for a
teammate element of risk there but he's
won the
ball
[Applause]
mkhitaryan and the Counterattack is on
options
available can they make it
count well he read that brilliantly at
the
[Applause]
back
quad W the Colombian Cuts in
Martinez well somehow the goalkeeper got
to it well the corner played into the
box and held by The Keeper at the second
time of asking well he's just pulled off
a great first save there now they can
all calm
down intercepting it
intelligently 10 minutes left for
play
Rodrigo could P one back here and he's
outdone himself wonderful save
[Applause]
there but he's gone short with it
cutting the ball
back he'll be breathing a sigh of relief
ball one counter attacking
chance well at Peter po the defending is
here but I have to say it's still a very
tidy finish he looked really assured
there he might very well have late
excitement here minutes to go and just
one goal between
[Applause]
them
rodado nice waight on the
pass and it's two for him today a
masterful performance The Defenders
unable to stop
it so the current score line
42
valde the ball with LCA
Modric well they've given him too much
space that's a foul and it will be a
potentially dangerous free
kick so a Personnel change
[Applause]
then
oh the post denied
him and problem solved for now just have
to make sure they don't get caught on
the counter
attack mikitarian
might still be able to do a bit of
damage a goal how about that he's put it
away to make it a
[Applause]
hattick well here we can see it again
normally I'm the first to point the
finger in a go and that will do it the
referee's whistle means it is officially
Final in get the Victory and the three
points their fans are going to be happy
with this well Derek they were the
better team all over the pitch we saw
good individual performances we saw an
attack which was always threatening and
they played really well what a
performance that was
[Applause]
today
