These are My Immortal color settings for
valerant so a lot of you have been
asking me for my color settings that I
use and even though I change them ever
so often these are the best ones in my
opinion they make the game more vibrant
for a better look and also highlight
opponents better which will help a lot
so for this you're going to have to go
to Nvidia control panel and then copy
the settings that are on your screen
right now and you're good to go enjoy
