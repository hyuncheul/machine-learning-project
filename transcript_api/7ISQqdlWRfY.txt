a crucial day stands in front of them
the knowledge that a win is required to
make it true to the promotion match and
no doubt about it their opponents won't
be of a mind to do them any favors at
[Applause]
all we have all the action for you live
coming up next right here on EA
TV good evening and welcome ahead of
what should be a pulsating night of
football my name is Derek Ray and
sitting alongside me in the commentary
position is the former Arsenal and West
Ham Midfield player Stuart Robson and if
things go well for them they can qualify
for a promotion match how do you see the
match going Stuart well thanks Derek
what a game we have in store here the
motivation couldn't be any higher a win
here and they'll get themselves a
promotion match it should be
exciting and back with
K well they couldn't keep
possession promising
[Applause]
sequence good idea
decent
[Music]
[Applause]
position tremendously strong in the
tackle can they trouble the opposition
this time well didn't go to plan in the
end good use of
Advantage well it clearly was deflected
so it will be their throw
in
unable to keep the ball that
time well there was never any doubt we
were always going to be highlighting him
after his exploits in the last match
breaking the club's goal scoring record
well he's got the record but he's such a
good goal scorer I'd expect him to add a
lot more to his tally starting today
what a talent he
is
a very good
tackle getting
forward and that's very good refereeing
to let the play Flow can they cover
up and the keeper more than equal to
it well you have to think they're going
to take the lead at some point they're
really looking dangerous at the
moment well a clear foul but the referee
letting the play
[Applause]
Flow and a tidy
ball possibilities Inside the
Box oh an incredible clearance I must
say I didn't see that
coming and in the right position to make
sure it didn't go all the way
through
K
div regain
[Applause]
possession from one side of the pitch to
the
other promising
pass and possession given
[Applause]
[Applause]
away onto
Pepe
Kobayashi
matsuda moving into the advanced
position is it going to be keeper did
his job to begin
with
surely oh a moment of cure class had to
catch it perfectly and didn't he
just one n
then
Bale
Bruno far from a good
[Applause]
pass
[Applause]
[Applause]
matsuda and snuffed out the danger
[Applause]
immediately
div
Bale well it looked highly promising but
they got nothing out of it
[Applause]
Kobayashi Paul well when you have the
lead you can play in this manner keeping
the ball like this was given it straight
to the
[Applause]
opposition moving forward effectively
timely
[Applause]
intervention
[Music]
chance for him to get in behind
maybe well I must say it did look so
promising but the flag is raised offside
the verdict Stewart well he's just too
eager there it's the right run but he's
made it too
early
Kobayashi
to for
Stanley and there to
intervene onto
Bruno and he keeps
going pretty straightforward defending
dealing with that
cross and there it is the halim
[Applause]
whistle
[Music]
[Applause]
well they've got things going again here
and I wonder what kind of second half we
have in store for
[Applause]
us
perfect
tackle
h
Kobayashi nicely cut out
the attack looks promising but a good
piece of Defending to bring it to an
end
K Ramos
now losing
possession real determination and the
challenge a throw in
here well that one has promise and Under
Pressure that was a fine
claim matuda and Beyond the last
Defender
[Applause]
offside
a long way from the perfect
[Applause]
pass
[Applause]
Bale lost
possession
good Vision can he get onto this well
the decision is offside and he's bound
to be a bit disappointed he's actually
made his run before his teammate had
control of the ball and that's why it's
offside and the keeper collects under a
bit of
pressure Ball's
gone good looking ball there could be a
chance
[Applause]
now well they get themselves level here
and that was goalkeeping right out of
the top drawer it's absolutely
remarkable his reflexes were brilliant
[Music]
there and he's fired over with the
corner and taking care of the
[Music]
situation nice wait on the
Pass based on that challenge he wouldn't
be at all surprised if the referee
reaches for his
[Applause]
pocket
[Applause]
the crossbar got in the
way well had that gone in the game was
firmly in their hands now though they've
got to make sure they don't let this
slip yes in possession again and maybe
another opportunity developing here
that's what you call defending from the
front possibilities
here
and the pass was just that little bit
off nearly found its
Target back with
Ramos decisive in the tackle and a throw
in
here well using the space really well
you've got to
say Bale has a go traing as the they
must make good use of this
[Applause]
corner this could be the equalizer and a
goal to level this contest all
even so in business once more on the
back of that very important can put them
in front oh a stab piece of
[Applause]
Defending well plenty of scope for them
to
[Applause]
attack fine cross into the middle superb
stop and an effect of
clearance Crossing
possibilities and that's going to result
in a goal kick
[Applause]
Paul
[Applause]
Kobayashi plenty of forward momentum
here but can they
produce that's a nice looking ball and a
simple clearance a good one
just 10 minutes remaining
here nice switch of
play well the atmosphere is so tense
inside this Stadium but can they find
that moment of magic to win this game
the crowd certainly think so just listen
to
[Applause]
them
well here they are on the attack can
they go on and win the game has to be
and he finds the net he could hardly
Miss well a dramatic moment near the end
and that might well be the
decider quiick awarded then by the
referee
forward they go chasing the game clear
to see who got the last touch so a throw
in it'll
be very alert defending to cut off the
[Applause]
supply here's
Ramos oh great vision
well nothing comes of it in the end
because the flag has gone up Stewart
well he knew where the space was but
he's just been too eager and that's why
he's
offside what can he do with it
now 2 minutes of stoppage time coming
up wilting under the pressure and now
they try to go
forward
can they be creative from here he's in
with a
[Applause]
Chance oh what a top-n pass and a goal
they lead by two now and that allows
them to breathe a bit more
[Applause]
easily
well here's the replay the pass over the
top has just the right amount of pace on
it and the strike could not get any
better and so the referee blows for full
time and it goes down as a victory for
the
[Applause]
visitors
for
h
as a footballer you desperately want to
be involved in these matches so much on
the line and this is the first promotion
game The Players had better be ready for
what the opposition will throw at them
this promises to be
special stay with us for our live
coverage right here on
eatv
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be enrolling my name
is Derek Ray and sitting alongside me
ready to provide all the analysis is
Stuart Robson and a new experience for
them as they make their promotion match
debut Stuart your expectations well I've
enjoyed watching them up to this point
but today will be tough that's for sure
they'll need to be at their very best to
win here I
think passes like that very much in his
repertoire that's a good looking
ball well I take my hat off to him
because that was superb
[Applause]
defending how about the cross
but it's one pass after
another good Vision can he get onto
this so now a
[Applause]
corner let's see about the delivery
clearing his
away
that's a very fine CL Under
Pressure well a very important record
broken last time out you're looking at
the club's new all-time top scorer yeah
what a goal scorer but I'm sure there's
still a lot more to come from this
player including today maybe it's a
remarkable
[Applause]
achievement
Divo
[Applause]
good looking
cross not messing around with that
clearance good
distribution
[Applause]
Bale now can they make something
[Applause]
happen excellent ball over the
top
and tily played couldn't keep
it and possession given
away Cabrera on the
[Applause]
ball Mar
marel and credit du a good
intervention not quite the clearance
they were hoping
for unable to keep the
ball well they're on the scent of
something
positive
Marcel tongen with
it good run very much in control of the
situation and options in the
[Applause]
center
well that's the sign of a well organized
defense a chance maybe from the wide
position has someone to play it to oh
dealt with by the
[Applause]
goalkeeper and overcomes the corner
struggling to get it
[Applause]
away could be
dangerous but the flag is raised and
that brings this move to an end well he
saw the pass but he just couldn't get it
away quickly
enough
Divo back with
Ros nice switch of play
promising attack this will he find the
net oh tremendous goal technical
Excellence to finish that one off
wonderful to have that in your
repertoire well here's the replay and
what a well delivered cross this is
perfectly placed and he makes no mistake
with the Finish he showed a lot of
composure
[Applause]
there not made it look routine but read
it well
well he was under a bit of stress but
back to the
[Applause]
keeper Shin oh great attacking play and
it's opening up and a goal an end to
endend game and they weren't behind for
long
Bale and back with
K Ramos with it
this is Bruno and a strong
[Applause]
[Applause]
tackle he's beaten his man can he put
them in front but it was a wonderful
chance but the goalkeeper comes through
yes Derek we have to give credit to the
keeper but surely he should have scored
there that's a big big chance the game
has been turned on its head they have
never stopped believing and now they
sense
[Applause]
Victory
K now with
Bruno well the electronic board showing
one additional
minute
[Applause]
and with that the first half draws to a
[Applause]
close
ch
so back underway here into the second
[Applause]
half the cross is on excellent
assessment of the situation at the
back now with Bruno
Splendid defending and it needed to
[Applause]
be could be
threatening and that a piece of
goalkeeping you're going to see again
and again and
again
can someone get on the end of this well
capable of a better clearance than
that oh that one has
promise very good
[Applause]
challenge this a message for Alex O'Neal
Alex O'Neal can you please return to
your vehicle
fail on the ball
Ramos and easily
[Applause]
intercepted
wo just have to make sure they don't get
caught on the
Counterattack
can he do it oh a moment of pure class
had to catch it perfectly and didn't he
just well they're moving it around with
real purpose
here well we have 30 minutes to
go showing a real will to win the
ball
this is
Bruno it is to be a throw
[Applause]
in
Marcel committed
challenge
Fen
woo and he read it well
defensively now perhaps they can counter
from
here takes aim and nearly a goal after
that breathtaking move well that was
Counterattack in football at its very
best Unfortunately they just couldn't
finish it
off
Marcel moving the ball nicely but can
they Forge
ahead this is
Bruno plenty of forward momentum here
but can they
produce it might be the moment to get
them ahead reading it well denied once
more and cleared away and by a W for
thin margin
offside rewarded for that brilliant High
Press might work out nice looking move
and he's kept it out fully stretched
somehow reaching it well just listen to
these fans they're urging their team to
score here and take the lead now sending
it
in and they'll get ready for the throw
in well no excuse to give the ball away
from your own throw
[Applause]
in
how about the
cross trying to find the right angle of
attack well he read that brilliantly at
the back and Beyond the by line goal
kick
then nice looking
pass and the
shot and strong fisted away and the
teams are level and every corner counts
at this
jumction play over just wanted to get it
out of
there Ramos with
it excellent
defending real chance and a goal at this
stage of the game it might be be
decisive and just look at their
[Applause]
supporters and passing it well well time
is of some concern can they level
matters pretty clear who got the last
touch so it will be a
corner
who can he pick out oh late drama here
all level again incredible
scenes
Bale back now to the
goalkeeper
we are must take the lead here and they
do and with so little time left that
will surely be decisive astonishing
[Applause]
drama well how about this
43 well there are attacking but time is
the great
enemy and that is the end of the contest
and not a happy outcome as
[Applause]
far
[Applause]
[Applause]
much
one
you're looking at a player who's been
scaling impressive Heights in recent
performances four goals in three matches
you cannot argue with that figure who's
to say he doesn't have a similar
performance in him
[Music]
today we're live on
eatv and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be enrolling I'm
Derek Ray in the commentary position and
I'm joined for analysis by Stuart Robson
and it's going to be fascinating to see
how these two sides Fair as they come up
against each other how do you see the
match going Stuart well thanks dck as
always the scene is set two good teams a
great playing surface and a vibrant
atmosphere has all the ingredients for a
really exciting
[Applause]
game but on you go says the referee
[Applause]
Advantage
[Applause]
Jin
Bean now in a more than decent
position good waight on that
pass a good and fair
challenge but he's certainly not
alone well he's beaten his
opponent well a very important record
broken last time out you're looking at
the club's new alltime top scorer yeah
what a great achievement but he won't
want to stop there he loves scoring
goals and I'm sure there's a lot more to
come from him including a couple more
[Applause]
today good work from wonderers to win
the ball
[Applause]
back and back with k
[Applause]
and they will be awarded a free kick for
that and he'll go back and hands out a
yellow card here yeah he was always
going to go back for that challenge it
was a poor one you have to
[Applause]
say it looks
promising now he must favor the cross CR
oh could be an opportunity
here really clever
[Applause]
pressing Bale that's a lovely
ball lovely ball over the top well
unable to hold as run and that's
[Applause]
offside
[Applause]
Jin
so
Jin and given away by
Wanderers took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop them
Kelly wanderer's now in potentially a
dangerous
[Applause]
position possibilities inside the
[Applause]
box and an astute piece of
Defending
Bale well doesn't have to do it on his
own teammate in support and a goal to
give them the lead they have their
[Applause]
reward well the ball is moving once more
how important will that opening goal
prove to
[Applause]
be
[Applause]
and cutting it
[Applause]
out
Bale Ramos with
it now plays with a positional sense
that is second to
none
Jin
bean
perisic and back with Kelly
now Kelly what can Wanderers do from
this position now delivering that deep
cross oh no not a moment the keeper will
want to revisit well he's got to pick
himself up now
so back underway they've leveled it at
1-1
[Applause]
here Crossing into the middle in
position oh yes you have to Marvel at
the sheer spectacle of it taking
Everyone by surprise yet at the same
time we know just how capable he is
a special
moment so the ball is rolling again 2-1
the score
line
pesic Bean an encouraging Wanderer move
this the switch of play
now
so well they keep passing
away I think I spoke too soon wasn't the
best of passes
finally well not a Million Miles Away
From The Equalizer well he couldn't
quite Get It On Target but at least
they're making chances
now Ramos now and he's lost custody of
the ball
here
oh a brilliantly timed tackle when it
really mattered well in the grand scheme
of things pretty straightforward for the
keeper well just one minute of time
added on for stoppages
here and there it is the halim
[Applause]
whistle
[Applause]
we
[Applause]
so back in business here with Wanderers
trailing will they come up with the
right
[Applause]
response
k
Divo well they have it
again this could be the equalizer but oh
what an important save how about that
well at least he hit the target but he
should really beat the keeper from there
they should be level
now who can he pick
out just wanted to get it out of
there not much defensive cover there on
the flank
he's waiting in the middle this could
have
possibilities timely
intervention and he could be in proper
trouble here crossed into the penalty
area oh a tremendous block well they've
won themselves a corner and a chance
perhaps to add an additional goal for
[Applause]
security
now sending it in and clearing his
[Applause]
lines
Bale
k
[Applause]
Divo Crossing
opportunity he dealt with that ball
[Applause]
comfortably weros couldn't hang on to
[Applause]
it
wos might be able to cash in of
the emerit and teammates to play it to
and the danger still
on well he stumped it out of there
without much fuss and the challenge hals
them in their
[Applause]
tracks well making considerable progress
with the ball well still an issue
[Applause]
here and crossed in the direction of the
back post and he's done it parate again
a magnificent game
[Applause]
unfolding well another equalizer what a
Topsy Turvy game this has
been
K pressing like that will help the
[Applause]
cause this is
Bruno oh nice ball over the top to
[Applause]
Chase and made sure the pass wasn't
trouble
that's a good looking
ball stopped a certain goal well this
corner bear fruit for
[Applause]
them let's see about the
delivery good piece of Defending can
they Forge ahead terrific piece of
anticipation
a the high press was on and that's a
fantastic tackle plenty of players
waiting in the middle oh that's a fine
[Applause]
[Applause]
pass and you need your Defender to take
charge now we're inside the final 15
minutes well the perfect tackle really
and now a throw
in
Bale a really good
pass possibilities out wide for
Wanderers and it's opening up oh off the
post still
alive but he did what he had to do
defensively well that was so close
wasn't it will there be one more twist
in the tail before the end let's hope
so well for more on the injury let's go
down to our reporter Jeff re word from
the benches he's actually twisted his
knee that's why he's been trying it out
but at the moment he's carrying on che's
Jeff
well certainly thinking about a
winner oh yes what a
pass well nothing about that chip was
very positive well I'm not sure that was
the right option it's a really wasted
[Applause]
chance and just failed to keep the ball
in play that
time
and pressing from the
front and it comes down to the final 5
minutes well these fans are pushing
their team on here they sense a winners
[Applause]
coming
so well that's how to outwit your
opponent and a teammate got her out of
trouble great ball over the top well the
flag was up in good time bringing that
move to an end well he's just got to be
more patient there he's gone too
early well they still have designs on
the
[Applause]
win
he'll be breathing a sigh of relief ball
one and with that the referee brings
this contest to an end all square here
in what was a thoroughly compelling game
Stuart your analysis well it could have
gone either way I thought both teams
were very positive though Going Hammer
and tongs from the very start and I
think a draw is probably the fair
result
[Applause]
[Applause]
that's
a crucial day stands in front of them
the knowledge that a win is required to
make it through to the promotion match
and no doubt about it their opponents
won't be of a to do them any favors at
all complete coverage is next on EA
[Applause]
TV and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be enrolling my
name is Derek Ray and sitting next to me
here on the commentary Gantry is the
former Arsenal and West Ham United
midfield man Stuart Robson and the hope
is they'll be able to move on from here
to a promotion match Place Stuart what
are you expecting well than could be oh
body in the way
crucially clean
[Applause]
challenge oh lovely
ball and that will be a
corner
[Applause]
trying to deliver it accurately not the
most confident
[Applause]
clearance oh could be an opportunity
here wonderful
chance well body in the
way thumps
[Applause]
clear
[Applause]
and after that fantastic effort it's
gone out for a throw
[Applause]
in high quality
defending
[Applause]
Alonzo
[Applause]
might be able to produce from this
position corner kick fourth
[Applause]
coming who's going to get on the end of
it well not away
properly
chance here there it is and just the
ideal
start so the match has restarted One n
here this is
Bruno decent looking
[Applause]
pass
Bale a fine block
[Applause]
and that's an important
[Applause]
intervention and back with k
back with
Ramos that's a good looking
ball theise to shoot well that's really
sound goalkeeping not letting the
opposition have any
scraps mopping up
[Applause]
defensively fairly easy for the referee
to spot that deflection so now a throw
in
in the right place to cut out the
[Applause]
pass that is a really disappointing
effort goodness me on that occasion just
didn't make the right sort of contact
should be testing the goalkeeper from
that sort of
range
Reber well that's good defending well
organized at the
back
Bruno well couldn't find a teammate
unfortunately and a throw in to
[Applause]
come well that wasn't part of the plan
was it giving the ball away like
[Applause]
that
Bale good waight on that pass and coly
done in the
end good ball to switch the
play useful looking position you've got
to
say well there was impending danger but
good
defending
timely
intervention
div Ramos
now
[Applause]
Bale on to
Bruno well couldn't quite find his
teammate
Alonzo
chetto
Alonso well inching towards halime and
probably fair to say the fans were
hoping for a little bit better than this
Stuart your thoughts well it's been a
tight first half so far but they haven't
quite shown enough G in the attacking
third if however they can be more
dynamic in the 1 V1 situations they have
the quality to turn this
around what to like about that
pass it's neat passing confidence on the
ball well just couldn't play that
decisive Ball racing forward trying to
catch them
out could be and there it is a two goal
cushion now and they just need to keep
the
concentration
so the ball rolling again at
[Applause]
2-0
Bale keeping it on the ground slightly
off Target
[Applause]
however
baale the stoppage time situation one
minute here promising looking
ball and there it is the halim
[Applause]
whistle
[Applause]
do
[Applause]
well they've got things going again here
and I wonder what kind of second half we
have in store for for
[Applause]
us Crossing
opportunity and you need your Defender
to take
charge the
delivery my goodness that save fully
stretched he was one for his own
highlights
[Applause]
reel
and overc comes the
corner making sure nothing came of
it
cetto
[Applause]
Alonso oh nice ball well not quite what
he wanted to do with the
[Applause]
pass
Ramos a good Vision
there can he get one back oh blocked it
and quick thinking
[Applause]
defensively and the the No Nonsense
[Applause]
clearance he has time to play is
over throw in
[Applause]
given and the sh well that's really
sound goalkeeping not letting the
opposition have any scraps well could
this be the Turning Point the fans are
certainly hoping
[Applause]
so and a short Corner let's see could
pull one back here able to close down
the shot breaking at
PACE and space to cross it oh an
incredible clearance I must say I didn't
see that
coming well the referee allowing
advantage to a crew to
them and he's lost custody of the ball
here not messing around with that
[Applause]
clearance perfectly position to take it
[Applause]
away
Alonzo cleared away
comprehensively wonderfully weighted
pass so a corner
[Applause]
here
over it comes the clearance wasn't
[Applause]
decisive in it goes but wait a minute
that will not count well that was tight
it was a good finish
[Applause]
though
delightful pass well it nearly worked
out and a fine
[Applause]
interception a chance for him to get in
behind
maybe not away
completely and keeping it
out
[Applause]
let's see about the
delivery and No Nonsense defensive
clearance fine cross into the middle not
to be in terms of the Cross there goal
kick coming
[Applause]
up Ramos with
it and given acas of space to attack
here great strong tackle throw in
forthcoming there's the cut
back he'll be delighted to have won the
ball having made that difficult
challenge he's certainly not
alone but it Fizzles out thanks to that
piece of
[Applause]
Defending getting the ball for
forward well it clearly was deflected so
it will be their throw
[Applause]
in well there was impending danger but
good
defending
they really pressing their
opponents well he W strongly into the
challenge and the result is a throw
[Applause]
in onto Bruno well nearly there this
game almost over and looking at the fans
Stewart they appear to me to be more
than a bit gutted well they've been
second best that's for sure and the main
problem has been in Midfield where
they've been overrun at times they just
haven't been able to get enough
possession it's not been a good
performance
[Applause]
today now with
Bruno and nicely over the top
and a throw in it's going to
[Applause]
[Applause]
be would be a bit annoyed to have lost
the
[Applause]
ball promising
sequence well he certainly caught all of
that but was never going to trouble The
Keeper in the end goal kick it
is really good
challenge well totaling up all the
stoppages we'll have two additional
minutes the referee's letting it go as
they keep the
ball
Reber can he play it
in just cleared away in the nick of
[Applause]
time and there goes the final whistle
much to the disappointment of their
supporters you're absolutely right deric
they really struggle to get to grips
with the game they always seem second to
the ball and then just a few
[Applause]
m
know
a crucial day stands in front of them
the knowledge that a win is required to
make it through to the promotion match
and no doubt about it their opponents
won't be of a mind to do them any favors
at
[Applause]
all this is EA
