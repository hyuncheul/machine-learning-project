John he did well to steal the ball
there good save from the
header sent clear up the field
[Applause]
then taken from his
feet excellent coverage by the defender
superb save confident goalkeeping there
it was quite a shot that's a wonderful
stop did well to get anywhere near it
and offside
given neat pass steady defending cleared
away
safely picks up the loose ball
then intercepted
collects the loose
ball gave him no room
there good aerial
challenge back off the bar
they've given it
away he's not given a foul and I have to
say the referee has amazed me
there and safely played away from the
[Applause]
area good
movement safely into the Keeper's hands
then well
collected the ball lofted up field
session given away he was in well
there that's just over the bar good
effort played out then and headed back
takes the ball well
intercepted steals the
ball and that's blocked by The Keeper oh
a superb strike to beat the keeper the
ball buried into the top corner
let's have another look at the
goal and The Score 1
n good ball winning challenge
good height on the
challenge and he's made a great save
Tipp the ball away
nicely did well there good clearance
from the
box and he's kept it out just and the
header easily dealt with by The
Keeper the ball sent up field and headed
back
then must score he's hit the ball oh
there the keeper beaten I'm not at all
happy with that oh nice to get a goal
John he looks pleased with
that we can take another look at that
then level again then one all close to
halim then and the sides level takes the
ball then
he flew in there with the challenge and
I think the referee will want to talk to
him about
that and that's a yellow card you have
to watch his behavior from now
[Music]
on and they're trying to get a wall
together
here oh
lucky headed
on he really th that just a Pity didn't
control it
better goal kick played out 1-1 then
here at halim everything still to play
for
[Music]
the players back out then for the second
half here we go then second half
[Applause]
underway the ball sent clear up the
field by The
Keeper Brave stuff from the
goalkeeper cleared up
field and that's well wide at the Target
I'm
afraid play up field straight back then
good
head block the shot and it's a goal a
great War when the ball hit the back of
the net they enjoyed
that another look at the goal
then 2-1 then and maybe they can build
on
that given
away blocked by the k
oh that's a tremendous goal he knew it
was goal bound from the moment it left
his foot not having the best of it at
the back right now are they two goals
theyve let in and quick succession
so the score now 3-1 and they're moving
away well time
[Applause]
challenge up for the ball the goalkeeper
taking no risks with that pouncing on
the loose
ball cleared up the
[Applause]
pitch met well and headed
back the ball back off the off the
bar yes a great headed goal Rose well
and made the space count great finishing
he'd be pleasing himself now John nice
hattick been caught by the cameras as
well the instant replay here then I'm
sure you won't mind seeing that again
4-1 now then and this is becoming a
shade
one-sided possession
[Applause]
lost the ball played up the
pitch he struck the
mo the ball stolen the ball given away
then headed forward
[Applause]
played up the field by the
keeper and possession given away nips in
to take the
[Applause]
ball and the keeper stopped him in his
tracks Brave
Challenge and cleared up field by The
Keeper
sent clear up the field then the ball
headed
[Applause]
back quality long
ball the shot direct at the keep it's a
goal the keeper beaten from a very
difficult angle here great
football I think we can take a look at
the replay here
here six goals here then and most of
them at one end 5-1 the
score and yes it's gone in the keeper
clearly wishing he were somewhere else
no doubt we'll find out what the
celebration means after the match
someone should give the commentators a
guide to them perhaps the replay here
then
they've lost
possession the referee indicating a free
kick not the worst challenge we'll see
today
John the ball hitting the keeper there
rather than in making a save
yes it's there the ball put away from
inside the 6-y
Box the celebrations just get crazier
every
year well worth another look at the goal
then
the match over here then but still
another two matches for them to play
before the league stage of the
tournament is
