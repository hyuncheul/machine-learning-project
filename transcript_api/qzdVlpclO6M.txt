tomorrow is a
hope never a
promise are you there dear wolf I am
little lamb are you sad I am what does
it feel like a long hunt with no kill it
is temporary a promise lies in
store today it seems we must put our
animosity aside we've never been enemies
sister why have we Wings sister if not
to fly why do we have feet if not to
tread upon the
soil insects you are not worthy of
Ascension you are not worthy of the Ws
let me show you what it is to fall you
would bind yourself to this realm Morana

worldender now you die you leave me no
other choice

darkness all life is
temporary just looking out for the

blade one
purpose the
wind I will not forget who I
am I will follow this path until the
end just looking for a road
home no more
running dying's the easy
part all your life has led to this
moment there's a time not yet we must be
patient I'm hungry I know these are dark
Omens every life ends with us we'll see
about that tear up the
throat flee or stand firm doesn't matter
time to end this death itself can't stop
me
do not stand in my way that the best you
got

ours he'll be mine he is for the other
no that was mine come back please no one
evades us for long I never forget a
scent trind deir my love I always sued
this would be our end I die a thousand
times for you could you just stay alive
instead will they forget us they will
try we will remind
[Music]
