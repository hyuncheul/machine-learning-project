Spectrum kurami glitch pop and Chrono
void which bundle is the best I run a
poll to let you decide which is better
in fourth place with 8% of the votes is
glitch poop it's definitely not bad but
for the price you can do better in third
place with 10% of the votes is Chrono
void in my opinion very underrated but
the community doesn't agree in second
place with 22% of the votes is Spectrum
one of the most legendary bundles in
this game and for pretty great reason
it's fantastic and in first place with
59% of the vot is Konami possibly
recency bias but at the same time the
animations variants and everything else
makes this bundle pretty incredible do
you agree
