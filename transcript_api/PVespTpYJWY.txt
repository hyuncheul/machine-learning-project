we get a buff to Yumi my opinion is Yumi
is probably slightly weak and could
maybe use a small buff but I will note
that Yumi probably has to be slightly
weak because of the character is doesn't
mean she's in a perfect spot right now
she might need a buff in the future but
just noting that like Yumi probably has
to be slightly weak over the long term
