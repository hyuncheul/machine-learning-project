I have never played this
game this is League of Legends but I
thought like it would be cool just to
check out the Cinematic I didn't even
know that League of Legends had
cinematics if they ever release an MMA
RPG that supposedly it's on the way uh
probably they will have a foundation for
the for the lore with all of this right
I haven't watched Arcane unfortunately
but I I would like to
soon tomorrow is a
hope never a promise
like d this are blizzard quality
cinematics I know if people like
comparing blizzard with this
but that looks really
good oh [ __ ]
[Music]
music they look
bad
like
[Music]
angels are these like Champions or
whatever you call
it in the
game or are this like the new ones
upcoming or
something these are our Champions
Okay BL head it's in my
veins oh it's in my blood oh wow they
they are kind of hot I got to
say oh
[ __ ] that's probably the Q skill or
something
right or the
ultimate no she's doing the ultimate now
may you going
May it's a
stretch that I won
come okay Bandits or
something o this guy is like raiding
from Mortal
Kombat you should never mess with
somebody who has a hat like
that see
oh damn he got
him oh dude he he looks awesome he's
like the some Goku or
[Music]
whatever the Chinese one you
know okay this guy is op
[Music]
man or something
allight I'm still here
go
win I mean I bet that's a Skilling game
there's no way that's not a Skilling
game
subo oh this guy has been sleeping there
the whole time
until
winter oh D that's that's legi that's
like a druid or something or who is
this is it like one
hero isn't this character the dude the
one the Tyler one plays or am I
crazy that's all I know about League of
Legends yeah know it looks like an he
from world
Warcraft I'm
[Music]
still it's
silvanas what the hell he was like
possessed or
[Music]
something
I love watching this without having any
clue about League of Legends I I just I
put oh Arcane season 2 I put my own
twist to it you know what I mean that
was really cool though I thought that
was pretty cool I don't know anything
about Le of Legends but I thought that
was cool I I really like her and the
seiro looking guy that's a Kindra lamb
and Wolf the personification of death in
the universe oh that's cool but why
would was she her was it wasn't it her
or or am I tripping I think I'm tripping
I thought it was the same person my bad
yeah there you go there you go there is
uh the Cinematic for League of Legends I
know I doubt I will ever play this game
but if they release um an mm RPG 100% I
will play it it has been RoR for I don't
even know how long an mm RPG and
probably will have the lore of all these
people so so yeah that it would be worth
to check this all the cinematics out
