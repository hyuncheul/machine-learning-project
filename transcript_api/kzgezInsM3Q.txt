this is valin's top five Vandal skins in
my opinion fifth goes to orexis this
skin was one of my favorites when it
came out and frankly nothing's changed
fourth goes to Reaver this skin has aged
like fine wine and frankly it's just a
Timeless classic third goes to forsaken
I genuinely think this skin is severely
underrated it's so classy I love it so
much second goes to kurami this skin
impressed me so much the design is so
Sleek minimal and beautiful and the
animations are just top here and first
goes to Prelude to chaos this skin grew
on me an insane amount I genuinely used
to think it was me now it's by far my
favorite Vandal skin
