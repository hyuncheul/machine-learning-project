hello
as a footballer you desperately want to
be involved in these matches so much on
the line and this is the first promotion
game The Players had better be ready for
what the opposition will throw at them
this promises to be
special
stay with us on
[Applause]
eatv one of the great things about
football is that no one knows for sure
what's going to happen let's see what
unfolds here tonight I'm Derek Ray ready
here on the commentary position and
alongside me is the former Arsenal West
Ham and commentary midfielder Stuart
Robson and a new experience for them as
they make their promotion match debut
Stuart how do you see this one going
yeah thanks Derek this should be a good
game so far they've done really well to
be in this position now they need to put
in another decent performance it's a big
game for
them successfully cut
out
Jong
[Applause]
Bush and a good
tackle Raphael
now well it's a good-looking position is
there a goal in the future and clears
his lines
brilliant team pressing chances
on gives it a go a strong hand on the
[Applause]
ball not looking all that comfortable on
the
[Applause]
ball
nasit
just cutting off the
[Applause]
supply
Bush and Hazard on the ball well back
and forth in terms of
[Applause]
possession
Jong
gold it's a weighted
pass excellent
block and they'll get ready for the
throw
in
[Applause]
Tab and unable to keep
possession and support
available it's there for him and the
referee doesn't hesitate that is a spot
kick well no card just a warning and a
fair few protestations well not every
foul is a yellow card I think the
referee is right
here and he finds the net no
difficulties
[Applause]
encountered well as you can see the
keeper makes no effort in the end he was
hoping it would be struck down the
middle but it's an easy finish
really untiy in
possession and the advantage AC Cru to
the attacking
side
Sam and defensive play to be
applauded
three oh he's lost possession of the
ball there it is and he could scarcely
have had an easier
Finish Well let's see this again he
tries to run out with the ball he has
the ball taken off of him he's made the
wrong decision and suddenly the ball's
in the back of the net terrible
defending tab
Bush now the perfect position to read
[Applause]
it
[Applause]
Sam and here's Rodriguez the referee
allowing advantage to acrw to them what
a genuine opportunity but it was
squandered go
kick over the touch line for a throw
[Applause]
in
Jong
gold
a possession lost intercepted excellent
refereeing advantage in
operation a chance maybe from the wide
position delivered into the area
here well defensive resilience
[Applause]
there he has teammates around him
but quick thinking
defensively that's very good refereeing
to let the play
blow
green now will they be able to play it
in behind the defense must score oh that
is an outrageously good stop well great
reflexing from The Keeper he did
brilliantly
[Applause]
there
playing it in and in a crowded area the
keeper has managed to get
there
Jong took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
them well we're almost at the halfway
stage and they're not making hum
Advantage work for them one little bit
here Stuart your assessment well they
can certainly play better than this
they've been too slow in possession and
not aggressive enough with their closing
down those two things have to change in
the second half if they're to turn this
around and just one minute of time added
on for
stoppages Distributing it
well oh big opportunity and what a
magical save it
[Applause]
[Applause]
was who's going to get on the end of it
well they couldn't take advantage of the
chance
the first half here comes to an
[Applause]
[Applause]
end
[Applause]
so the two teams have switched around
and the second half is
underway
and both hands on it good
goalkeeping it's got to
[Applause]
me on the ball Ramos the referee knew
that was Foul Play but Advantage it is
and that puts them in position real
chance
keeper did his job to begin
[Applause]
with and a time for calm on the
ball well as those stats tell us their
attacking play today has been
exceptional Defenders have come out at
the right time midfielder completely
dominated the game and the front players
movement has been
[Applause]
excellent
gold
it needs an accurate
cross can he finish this there it is a
fantastic goal and no wonder he's off
[Applause]
celebrating and the pass was off Target
it'll be a
throw and it took a touch off the
defender so it will be a
[Music]
corner and he's fired over the
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
corner unable to keep the
ball
tab extremely sloppy in
[Applause]
possession
and it's with
[Applause]
Rodriguez now breaking at PACE potential
danger well it looked so promising but
it all comes to
nothing this is looking
threatening and a very good
[Applause]
challenge not smooth in
possession
[Applause]
Green Oh a fine
block well these fans are making for the
exits now their team have been totally
out play
today Jong well there's an example of
how to press high
[Applause]
up but he took care of it
[Applause]
defensively
an important
[Applause]
interception 15 minutes left for
play Losing possession a bit easily and
not cleared away properly well last gas
defending but brilliant
defending
really good
challenge Now options are plenty now
let's see about the cross and there it
is a goal but will it be purely a
consolation at this stage of the
proceedings they haven't been at the
best
Sam
[Applause]
gold continues his
run how about the
[Applause]
cross
absolutely spot on with that
[Applause]
challenge excellent ball over the top
and the flag has gone up here offside
the
[Applause]
decision
green
superb defensive judgment to end the
attack delightful
pass could be
[Applause]
threatening
Nesbit happy to take on the shot and up
for grabs off the
keeper and there goes the final whistle
it's gone the wrong way as far as the
home fans are
concerned with the game they always seem
second to the ball and then just a few
mistakes at
the
for
that's
the cameras are fixed to one man well
Derek his outstanding attribute is his
face not just over the first few yards
but over longer distances as well and
that makes him so difficult to play
against Defenders are unsure whether to
get tight or drop off a dynamic
player it's coming up
live
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be enrolling my name
is Derek Ray and my commentary partner
as usual is Stuart Robson and delighted
to be bringing you club's match action
Stuart what are your expectations for
today thanks Derek well both managers
will be reminding their players of
starting the game quickly pitting the
opposition back playing the ball forward
and regaining possession as quickly as
POS possible hopefully we get a really
good game
[Applause]
here
gold Reed now well a good
tackle
[Applause]
Bush Reed
now
and teammates to play it to superb block
on the back of the ball from the
flank and defensive play to be
applauded
Ishikawa
Messi took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
[Applause]
them
[Applause]
reading it
[Applause]
well Reed
now in a position from which they could
potentially do a bit of damage here wose
have it
back
we saw the situation
[Applause]
developing
spearing this attack looks highly
[Music]
promising a chance to whip it
[Music]
[Applause]
in
well just the tackle that was
[Applause]
needed now he must favor the
[Applause]
cross
Cavani he got in the way of that
[Applause]
cross
[Music]
alhassan in the right place to cut out
the
pass
alhassan we're not cherishing the ball
the way they usually
[Applause]
do well that'll be a free
[Applause]
kick
oh good
finish a goal to give them a one n lead
an excellent value for that Advantage
you've got to
say well here's the replay and just look
how quickly they break forward once they
win the ball back and then through on
goal he just goes for power and smashes
it past the keeper there's no stopping
that what a great
[Applause]
finish
[Applause]
spearing looking for the final pass that
will open things
[Applause]
up and the referee sens allowing them to
carry on Advantage with them weros came
away with
it gives it a go and putting his body on
the line might still be able to do a
better of
damage it's got to be well fantastic
reflex action from the
[Applause]
goalkeeper is this the
moment look like a certain and goal but
that's a great
challenge
spearing not a clear foul but the
referee letting the play
Flow
delivered into the
box just wanted to get it out of
there might work out could be in
here he can't hold on to
it well he sted it out of there without
much
fuss well it's a really poor challenge
now what's the referee going to do about
it well deemed to have been a
cautionable offense well no no question
about it he deserved his booking
[Applause]
there so the whistle then we're at the
halfway stage in this
match
[Applause]
MO
[Applause]
and back in business Wanderers behind
will they be able to find a rot back
into the
game

it
brilliantly they've gone and scored
again they're doing everything in the
power to make sure they're not pegged
back well here you can see it again good
run great strength and a composed finish
Under Pressure that's a top class
goal
spearing now with
Messi
alhassan he's going forward well
here
Messi the save was a good
[Applause]
one

Short
spearing and a good challenge to bring
that attack to an end oh that's a fine
[Applause]
save favoring the short
one it's shawa No Nonsense

following that
challenge getting in there to take it

Jong and a successful intervention
winning the ball
back nicely cut out now counterattacking
possibilities they need to get bodies
back can they convert brilliantly
[Applause]
blocked
Ishikawa now in a more than decent
position the clearance wasn't
decisive well they've survived the
attack
spearing clear to see who got the last
touch so a throw in it'll
be nicely cut

clean Now options are
[Applause]
plenty well that's a really good
authoritative tackle throw in
here
well it was the own
[Applause]
