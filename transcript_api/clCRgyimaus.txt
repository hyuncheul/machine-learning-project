should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be olling I'm Derek
Ray and delighted to have Stuart Robson
sharing commentary duties with me and if
all goes to plan they can progress to a
promotion match steuart what are your
expectations for today well Derek a win
here and they will get themselves a
promotion match they just need to keep
their nerve and put in a decent
performance
onto D
young can he finish this I'll tell you
what that really should have been one n
well it might be early in the game but
that should have put them in front
that's a golden
opportunity
Onan
likes to run with the ball at his
feet could cross it in
here a winning back possession must take
the lead here oh he's been denied and
they remain locked together well that's
a good save but really he should have
scored from there that's a big
chance over it
comes and No Nonsense defensive
clearance
chance to take the lead and a goal right
off the bat no wonder they're jumping
for
[Applause]
joy now the ball is moving once more how
important will that opening goal prove
to
[Applause]
be
[Applause]
Antonio jams
[Applause]
Davids
[Applause]
rainy
Antonio
Onan
Davids really good buildup but no end
product Oh yes what a
[Applause]
pass chance to finish
[Applause]
now high quality
defending
Anthony
brard
[Applause]
made it look routine but read it
[Applause]
well chance to play it
[Applause]
in could be oh it's a superb challenge
very
[Applause]
timely Davids
really good ball
[Applause]
there creative look about this well
unable to bend his run
offside needs to tread carefully a foul
but Advantage played and Inter intercept
Again
David teammates available well he's
allowed it to go over the touch line so
a throw
in and the Young on the ball couldn't
hang on to it what a
block oh that's a fine cross and it's
gone in the teams separated by two goals
now you cannot say they don't deserve
[Applause]
it
jamy
well did well to win the ball back and
showing fine
Vision it was on its way
[Applause]
in delivering it and in a crowded area
the keeper has managed to get
there in a decent position
now
[Applause]
jamy in
[Applause]
sua well we're almost at the halfway
stage and they're not making Home
Advantage work for them one little bit
here Stuart your assessment well they've
been outplayed in this first half and
they need that halftime whistle to come
soon so they can regroup change one or
two things tactically and come out with
a better attitude in the second
45
Czech
Davids will he play it in pretty
comfortable piece of
Defending now sending it in still not
clear
[Applause]
and I think the threat has been
averted the referee has decided there
will be just one minute of added
time
Shin oh lovely weighted ball they might
be
[Applause]
in and so the halim whistle is gone here
at the p in Paris
let
see
[Applause]
so here we go the stars of the second
half at the home of PSG the P
PR
notot to like about that
pass now who can she pick
out well that ball looks
promising what a genuine opportunity but
it was squandered go
kick jamy
what can they do from
here well disappointing end to the
move but he's certainly not
alone well you've got to conclude that
it was completely over
hit antoan could be a chance to break
[Applause]
here it needs an accurate
cross now she could do a bit of
[Applause]
damage chance to attack using
[Applause]
witch really fine piece of Defending
play to break his is
[Applause]
up the
young Distributing it
[Applause]
well
Antonio well moving the ball around
nicely as they try to get themselves
back within a
goal that's a good pass well it was easy
on the eye but the interception was
made and you don't want to lose
possession
there well this looks really productive
what can they do from this
position
[Applause]
Anan
jamy
Antonio just looking for the right
moment for that final
pass that's a useful cross well the
keeper wasn't fooled by it at all an
actual fact
regain
possession just 20 minutes remaining
[Applause]
now and unable to keep the
[Applause]
ball given away
again
chance to do
damage options in the
center really good
[Applause]
challenge
opportunity every goalkeeper would
expect to catch that
one Anthony
he's given it
away well this could really help the
cause he's blocked it the referee
spotted the infringement and it will be
a free kick in a position of genuine
[Applause]
Menace oh great technique at accuracy
but the keeper able to turn it away a
stunning
[Applause]
stop well all doing their bit to keep
them
out a really good
[Applause]
pass onto D
[Applause]
young took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
[Applause]
them that's a good looking ball
[Applause]
well nearly there this game almost over
and looking at the F Stewart they appear
to me to be more than a bit gutted well
they've been second best that's for sure
and the main problem has been in
Midfield where they've been overrun at
times they just haven't been able to get
enough possession it's not been a good
performance
today 5 minutes to go what a magnificent
pass and defensive play to be
[Applause]
applauded well the counter chance looks
very
real can they take advantage of the
situation well decent effort but not
troubling the keeper too
[Applause]
much
Antonio and the official confirming that
we'll have one additional minute and a
good looking
pass
antoan Davids can he find the net and
what a magical save it
[Applause]
was so the corner played into the box
could still be
dangerous
and that is the end of the game it goes
into the history books as a home defeat
well
for
that
the prize today is considerable win the
game and make it through to the
promotion match a big test of every
player's
[Music]
character this is
eatv
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be enthralling I'm
Derek Ray getting ready to bring you all
the action accompanied by my
broadcasting partner Stuart Robson and
if all goes to plan they can progress to
a promotion match Stuart what are your
expectations for today well Derek it's
certainly in their hands if they win
here a promotion match will be theirs
they just need to put in a good
performance it won't be easy
though and quick thinking
defensively
Onan
Davids determined
defending trying to open up the
[Applause]
defense
Anthony
[Applause]
Onan excellent
defending terrific block
there on a time for composure on the the
ball disappointing for the foxers to
give it away like
that good use of
Advantage
[Applause]
jamy chech well moving the ball forward
they might be in business good looking
cross I think most defens would expect
to be booked halting an attack in that
[Applause]
fashion and firing it to the near post
threatening but a good punch by The
Keeper it'll be a
corner who can they pick out
half-hearted
clearance and they they can't quite take
advantage in the end flag raised for
offside well timed
tackle feeding it
through and that's really well
read
Anthony
Honan and
anonio
jamy well plenty of scope for them to
[Applause]
attack cut it
back the referee knew that and a penalty
awarded spot kick coming
up well he's avoided a booking but the
complaints continue and I can understand
why I think it's a poor foul it should
be a yellow card for me and he puts it
away confidently
and back on the way one n it
is
[Applause]
seamons oh this looks useful now just
the tackle that was
needed
jamy chances on oh there it is a back
and forth s of match now they're level
again the lead lasted nearly
[Applause]
minutes so the ball is rolling again at
one0
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
jamy
brard really good
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
challenge
[Applause]
seamons well it was a foul but good use
of Advantage by the
referee sound piece of
[Applause]
goalkeeping
jamy antoan now time just challenge
magnificently Qui kick awarded then by
the
referee
brard
Anthony making progress dangerous Ball
but it wasn't quite as good as it looked
when it left the
boot
David the verdict is offside
[Applause]
here
Arnold plenty of players waiting in the
middle and still
dangerous and I think the threat has
been averted
[Applause]
grainy released it
nicely oh they've given him too much
[Applause]
space
Onan could play it
[Applause]
in well that's how to keep the
opposition at Bay trying to open up the
[Applause]
defense under real pressure here and a
goal it was served up on a silver
platter for
him
[Applause]
a chance then for the respective
managers to address their charges it is
halime
[Applause]
[Applause]
here
so back and business here the foxes with
the lead but it's a long way from being
done and
[Applause]
dusted a chance to whip it in well no
pressure on the keeper po
cross incisive
pass could be just can't get it past
him
Anan
[Applause]
Antonio BR now let's see what they can
do here disappointing but it's gone out
play
seamons
Lang
rice might be on to something with that
ball and he takes it on brilliantly
blocked and it cross the touch line so a
throw in
here the referee's letting it go as they
keep the ball
and with that the attack Fizzles
out
[Applause]
davits
seamons a really single-minded piece of
Defending to make sure nothing unto
happen that's a good
[Applause]
pass David
and the ball's
gone and a decent
delivery what a lovely strike lethal
piece of finishing drilled home with
true conviction tremendous
goal so back underway at
3-1
antoan
[Applause]
Brar room to roam for the
boxes he's in here and the keeper to the
rescue when he takes and beating that's
for sure it really is a top class
safe
brard beautifully weighted
ball oh but cutting it out on the nick
of
time
riberi oh nice ball com to the Penalty
area and after the cross defensive
action called
for you don't want to give the ball away
there oh yes it's gone in and now a
chance for them to Rebel in the
[Applause]
moment
not too much defending going on in the
grand scheme of things
[Applause]
4-1
Antonio antoan strong but fair
tackle all the way through to the keeper
then priority was to hang on to the ball
which he
did
jamy good bit of closing down possession
again with the B
well it could be on for him here well
somehow the goalkeeper got to
it who's going to get on the end of it
well sadly a bit of a tame effort that
one and far too close to the
goalkeeper well those steps back up what
we've been watching it's been a really
one-sided game and it's far too easy for
them to open up this defense this could
turn into a
route
Brar a quarter of an hour remaining
here and that'll be
[Applause]
offside
Arnold
seamons and danger R it well
read
seamons well nothing like annoying your
opponents when you have such an
effective passing game good
visualization and
[Applause]
execution
[Applause]
BR
Davids
[Applause]
Czech well these fans are making for the
exits now their team have been totally
out play
[Applause]
today prepared to take on the shot and
he's outdone himself wonderful save
there
corner kick played
in oh great block well another corner
kick conceded let's see what they do
this
[Applause]
time and he clears the
[Applause]
danger
Davids and foul it is
[Applause]
then well there's a living breathing
example of positional
sense well a really good
[Applause]
run well the keeper is Happy the bar was
there well cleared
away cross could be
useful oh that's a super piece of
Defending and there goes the final
whistle much to the disappointment of
their supporters oh dear Derek that was
a woring display play they were
completely outplayed in almost every
Department the coach has got a lot of
work to do before the next
game
