the community behind this video game is
genuinely kind of nasty I swear bro
valoran Community is toxic as I
don't know what went wrong at that
domestic Terror cell Riot games that led
to every single game they've developed
having a whack ass fandom but whatever
it is they got to exercise that demon
inshah because this is wild I don't
know how they did it but Val somehow
managed to attract the three archetypes
of gamer you want to see least in a
shooter at the same time it's almost
impressive cuz on the one hand the G is
mad popular with the hyper competitive
smurfing Cod kid type gamer like the kid
who will drop slurs you ain't even heard
of the second you unmute in live chat
but then you add to that fan base like
the OverWatch fan derogatory creepy
freaks who like come out of their goon
caves and make looking up characters
from this game awful but even on top of
that coming in with the steel chair this
game's popular with eaters too any one
of those would be whack on their own but
when they all Fusion dance together that
 hits another level of pungent rest
in power to the well adjusted Val
players out there I feel for y'all
