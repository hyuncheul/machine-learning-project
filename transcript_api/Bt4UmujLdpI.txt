there have been days of eager
anticipation prior to this gargantuan
Clash but now we need talk about it no
more and instead focus on the here and
now a match that has the capacity to
delight and Dazzle no matter who you
support two highlevel sides ready to go
at it it's Manchester City they take on
Real Madrid and it's coming up next on
eatv number
31 number two and a warm welcome our
venue today is the etad stadium here in
Manchester my name is Derek Ray and
sitting next to me here on the
commentary Gantry is the former Arsenal
and West Ham United midfield man Stuart
Robson and with the atmosphere really
building up nicely we should be in for a
terrific contest it is Manchester City
and they take on Real Madrid thanks
Derek as always this should be a good
game great atmosphere inside the stadium
we've got two teams full of quality some
interesting matchups and and two coaches
that want to play an attractive brand of
football what more could you ask
for and there the move ends for now
introducing the starting players for
Manchester city ederson is the
goalkeeper Nathan AK plays with Kyle
Walker as fullbacks will he find the net
and foiled by the post can they slot it
home and eventually goalkeeper ball well
you can sense the relief amongst his
teammates but what a first save that
was well what a terrific start by Real
Madrid they look a real threat and
should really be in front here well
they're on the ball and they just got to
forget about that moment of
Misfortune not high quality
defending and the advantage is with
City
Holland erling Holland and fine
goalkeeping
put in by De BR did his job
defensively well it's always a great
thrill to watch earling Halland in
action hang on Derek what a chance this
is oh that's top-notch goalkeeping
you've got to
say a chance to whip it
in Rodrigo Splendid
defending
well that was a great chance for ra to
open the scoring in what has been a
frenetic start to the game but credit to
the keeper it was an excellent save you
have to say playing with plenty of zest
and energy on the front foot once
more David
alabah rudiger has
it Tony
CR Crossing opport
Unity cutting in oh good
strike there it is the first goal of the
game and the lead certainly doesn't
flatter them good value for
[Applause]
[Applause]
it
so the ball rolling again with the score
line standing at one-
[Applause]
n venicius
[Applause]
[Applause]
Jr and cross failed to hold
it and he's through
here he got a good Palm on it
happy birthday and Manchester City
looking for inspiration at this
corner and de BR firing is
[Applause]
over clearly took a touch on the way out
of play so a throw in to
come
chuami Tony
Cross
nicely timed
tackle well unable to hold his run and
that's
offside venicius
Junior
Rodrigo very quick thinking
there oh great attacking
play
real chance oh that is a superb
save well just listen to the crowd they
know this is a big chance to
equalize Kevin De with the corner well
the keeper made that look relatively
easy in truth it
wasn't a real struggle to contain
him R it well
erling
Holland and he has options
available oh the threat is
there and that's what they needed
Manchester City a goal to level matters
here well here we we can see it again
look at the way he Glides past the
defender to create space for himself
while the movement in the box is equal
to it it's such good timing what a goal
well now he's let that run out of play
and it will be a throw in
here de
BR really fine piece of Defending play
to break us
up venio
J venio Jun
and just blotting out the
[Applause]
danger erling
Halland this is
Alaba
Bellingham and a strong
tackle must take the lead here oh he's
been denied and they remain locked
together well that's a good safe but
really he should have scored from there
that's a big
[Applause]
chance playing it
in oh he's given it penalty and an
opportunity now for them to jump in
front this to give them the advantage
and the penalty is converted I don't
think anyone really questioned
him
and the ball is moving again anyone's
guess how this is going to finish 21
[Applause]
currently a meaty but fair Challenge and
it will be a throw
in
meny Jude Bellingham determined
defending
wonderfully weighted
pass Holland and there it is two goals
in a matter of minutes incredible
stuff so back underway 3-1 the
score well just one minute of time added
on for stoppages
here Rodriguez
go federo
Valverde and there we have it that
brings to an end the first half here at
the
etad well you have to say erling Halland
has been at his excellent best up to now
not that that should come as any great
surprise well you won't see too many
better performances than
[Applause]
this and of and running again really was
spellbinding what we saw from City in
the first half so let's see how the
second 45 plays
out will it be a goal as they cut into
their advantage still plenty of life in
this
match
a the ball with
rodri Nathan a
here
committed
Challenge and Manchester City moving the
ball with
purpose rodri here's de brri it should
be oh tremendous penalty in the opinion
of the referee and this is seriously
getting away from them and it's also
going to be a booking well he's
absolutely right it's a penalty and a
yellow
card
to extend their lead
here and it goes a well taken
penalty so the current score line
[Applause]
42 significant acreage for City to run
into
well how about that for a piece of
tackling to break things up oh did so
well to deny
him
valde
Carval and the ball back with City
[Applause]
now
now a potentially dangerous position for
City oh in with a Chance oh no couldn't
beat the
goalkeeper that's a good ball and he's
made
Headway it's gone in and well he might
celebrate on the back of
that
back in Action then and Ry Al can now
entertain thoughts of perhaps pulling
level decent looking
pass we're into the final half
hour now perhaps they can counter from
here well unfortunately it fizzled out
in the
end
carvaka
Holland is it going to be and it's a
double for him H in this game no way for
the opposition to contain him and no
wonder he's off
[Applause]
celebrating if you enjoy high-scoring
contests this has been the game for
you federo
valde now with
Bellingham and he stopped them in their
[Applause]
tracks using all his defensive Acumen to
cut it
out
[Applause]
he's in
behind was it the denial of a clear goal
scoring opportunity if so he's
off and I think
that
right
that's one we could have called from
five miles away Stewart clear red card
offense well you've obviously got very
good eyesight but no doubt about that he
stopped the goal scoring opportunity
there he had to go I had my eyes tested
last week I'll have you
know oh terrific free kick and how well
the keeper did to Parry
it so a real Madrid
Corner well that's how to keep the
opposition at
[Applause]
Bay the referee has decided to give the
free kick decision the way of
city but it's gone out of Play Under
real
[Applause]
duress de
Brer oh good
save this might be ideal for the
[Applause]
counter didn't quite happen the way way
they had
hoped
meny and
Bellingham can he make it count and he's
kept it out fully stretched somehow
reaching
it and taken
short Real Madrid couldn't maintain
possession what can he do with it
now
foden oh he saved it
[Applause]
well let's see about the delivery and
still an opportunity well he was the
picture of concentration following the
corner really clever
pressing options in the
[Applause]
middle
[Applause]
foden nicely timed
tackle Val
Verde and he could be in proper trouble
here five minutes
left
well a really good run oh keeper dealt
with
[Applause]
it over it comes well it was a crowded
penalty area but the keeper done well to
hold on to that Under Pressure
here
Carvajal when in strongly
decisively trying to open them up he's
in position oh that is a Super Save well
he had to finish that but credit to the
goalkeeper that's a brilliant
stop not all that convincing
defensively could be a chance to break
here regain
[Applause]
possession
[Applause]
and there goes the final whistle it ends
in defeat for Real Madrid much to the
disappointment of their supporters well
Derek they were certainly off the pace
today beaten to the ball in too many key
areas they need to refocus now and
perform better next time
out well as you can see our cameras are
lingering on airling Halland yet another
exceptional performance to add to the
growing list well what more could you
ask for his buildup play was clever his
movement was Dynamic and he scored a
couple of goals what a player he
is
