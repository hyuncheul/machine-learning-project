I'm in a team
fight has Flash and has a ward to jump
away alongside a control Ward you can
see C on his way the ignite going down
onto zika there's the leap strike to
start it off flash counter strike knock
back zika Dodges away from the Nature's
gr but now has nothing at his disposal
to escape the clutches of KT apart from
another jump Bo over the wall I will
think he's a little penned in here
probably just going to die to the tower
who gets the kill he doesn't he's got
the blow away he did it zika's Escape
was so good we
