TV good evening tonight the spotlight
fall on North London we find ourselves
at the home of Arsenal I'm Derek Ray and
with me here on the commentary box is
Stuart Robson and we've got Champions
League semi-final first leg action
coming right up for you it's Arsenal up
against Ajax well Derek it's said that
semi-finals are the best games to win
and the worst to lose and why the host
are clear favorites I still think this
could be a great Match full of
individual battles a lot of passion and
great skill as
well be
Vine good technique
displayed it's a perfect
challenge and a look at the starting
lineup for Arsenal Martin erigor plays
alongside Dean rice in central Midfield
and leading the line today is Gabrielle
Jesus well it clearly was deflected so
it will be their throw in and the
starting 11 for Ajax yeah the same
formation and the same sort of game plan
so this will all be about which
individuals can get the better of their
opponent this will be a tough
[Applause]
battle
[Applause]
HTS St
berous
bhouse

move
Alexander

in Gabrielle
Jus he'll be delighted to have won the
ball having made that difficult
challenge
Bosa Kenneth
Taylor keeping the ball
moving well it was a good-looking
sequence but it comes to an
end
havet Alexander zenchenko
and promising stuff from
Arsenal zenchenko
hav
he's in control can they Forge ahead
safe Pair of Hands did his
[Applause]
job Aral a bit wasteful in
[Applause]
possession
Taylor
vervine
now it's all about passing as they try
to hit the front and a very good
challenge he's done remarkably well to
get himself forward here Gabrielle
Jesus might go ahead oh that is an
outrageously good stop well great
reflexes from The Keeper he did
brilliantly
[Applause]
there playing it
[Applause]
short K
havet very quick thinking
there and there it is the referee
whistle the first half has come to an
end here in North
[Applause]
London underway in the second half here
at the home of
Arsenal really effective shielding under
pressure
[Applause]
it looks
promising he read the situation
defensively and did his
[Applause]
job Alexander zenchenko
[Applause]
Martin
[Applause]
erard now
zenko
rice contact your nearest security guard
Martinelli and return to Gabrielle
Jesus fine work from Ax to win it
back
attacking possibilities for
Ajax but they dealt with the threat
posed Gabrielle
Jesus still pushing for that goal that
would see them Forge
ahead Gabrielle
Jesus well goal kick just as it was
looking for
promising com off the pitch and with
play stop they will make the change now
on theit number 20
[Applause]
tog Yos
Shalo
Rens no let up on the pressing front
Gabrielle
Martinelli and a good challenge to bring
that attack to an
end Divine
rench just 20 minutes remaining
now good strength to keep the
ball
and in the right position to make sure
it didn't go all the way
through Divine
Ren what can Ajax do from this
position oh big opportunity and a goal
the opener in the semifinal first goal
of the
contest
well here it is again the through ball
is absolutely inch perfect but should
the keeper be beaten at his near post I
don't think so he really needs to do
better in those
situations well a dramatic moment near
the end and that might well be the
decider
the clock is against Arsenal but what
can they pull out of the fire
here well didn't go to plan in the
end Steven
Bine oh superb
[Applause]
skill can he finish them off well
somehow the goalkeeper got to
it and the substitution will occur
[Applause]
now taken
short physically strong and secure on
the
ball
[Applause]
mikad interception to Snuff out the
danger
they have to show a commitment to attack
Arsenal in these trying
circumstances
zenko
Marcelli oh an incredible save to
preserve their lead well that's a great
stop and probably a match withing one
real drama late on
[Music]
here
who can they pick
out and the referee blows a whistle that
is the end of the contest and a fine
result for the away fans and if they can
repeat this sort of performance on home
soil and they will surely be going
through well at this stage of the
tournament you'd take any lead going
into that second leg
