today Reed bll challenge me to win
valerant games with a limited computer
and what I mean by that is that I'll be
starting at 240 FPS and every round I
win I'm going to lower it by 40 and on
the last round I'll end up by
[Music]
10 one enemy remaining all right here we
go 80 fps to start okay 80 FPS is not
that bad I'm not going to lie I thought
it would be worse it' probably be harder
versus like better players but I think
you can personally hit radiant with
this okay if you can hit radi on this
then you deserve a medal all right if
anyone actually watching this video is
playing on this no joke don't play the
game hold on hold on watch out this is
quite the experience this is quite the
experience oh my God he's chasing me no
no no no no
