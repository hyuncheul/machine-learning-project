intense and now we just can't wait for
it all to begin well just the sort of
weather the fans we hoping for this
evening it's absolutely ideal I'm Derek
Ray ready to bring you match comment and
alongside me is Stuart Robson and today
could very well be the day when the
title is clinched how's it going to go
Stuart well Derek they're going to be
slightly anxious of course but if they
just play their normal game I can't see
them slipping up here I think they'll be
Champions at the end of this
one the supporters think it's
on
Pano oh that chance here
oh magnificent save well he's just
pulled off a great save there what
reaction from the goalkeeper that
was really fine piece of Defending play
to break us
[Applause]
up
[Applause]
demele vtor
fera well he really is danger
personified but in this game oh DK what
a great
opportunity and in it goes we can't say
yet for sure but it could be a title
winning goal no wonder they're
celebrating can they hold their nerve
now
lotka running with the ball
[Applause]
confidently will he finish that levels
it and my goodness different equation
now will that really has made it
interesting they've got to get their
minds back on this
one and now their turn to have the
ball on the
offensive
zalinski not on you go says the referee
[Applause]
Advantage Giovani D
Lorenzo oin hen can he put them in front
but it was a wonderful chance but the
goalkeeper comes through yes there it we
have to give credit to the keeper but
surely he should have scored there
that's a big big
[Applause]
chance
Ugarte
Lee mbappe and the decision is one of
offside here
Giovani D
Lorenzo nice switch of
play failed to keep hold of
[Applause]
it yesper
Lindstrom
and on to ozin a goal oh dear oh dear
how significant could that be in
deciding who takes the title well that's
a massive blow for them they need a goal
quickly
[Applause]
here
Hernandez
[Applause]
Ugarte well that's s to put in a clean
tackle and he's made
Headway oh how about that for a
tackle deell tasked with taking the
corner well that header was never going
to be problematic for the
[Applause]
goalkeeper Mato
Pano
oim
[Applause]
hen fine buildup as they look to add to
their
advantage
labotka huge block corner kick awarded
and let's see if this will help them add
to their
lead pressure applied
good technique
displayed well no danger
[Applause]
now well they have it
again
Pano
zilinski and able to get a body in the
way this could be dangerous if he's not
careful and the advantage is with
PSG
in the right place to cut out the pass
useful looking position you've got to
say head over towards the back
post sound piece of
[Applause]
Defending well approaching the halftime
interval and PSG still trailing here
Stewarts what have you made of their
first half performance
well it's been a good game but they've
been second best in a couple of key
areas that needs to change in the second
half otherwise it's going to be a
disappointing result for
[Applause]
them and cleared away a corner kick
it'll
be fired over by Usman demele and that's
easy peasy for the
[Applause]
keeper
now the pressure being
[Applause]
exerted Mario
ruie out of play PSG throw in Forth
coming vtor
fera they might see the wide route as a
fruitful one
PSG and teammates to play it to well the
CR that time completely
overcooked
[Applause]
bapp and still they wait for the
[Applause]
chance and it's come off the
keeper and with that the first half
draws to a
[Applause]
close
well they've got things going again here
and I wonder what kind of second half we
have in store for
[Applause]
us and tidy defensive
[Applause]
play
PSG recovering possession
[Applause]
well Giovani D
[Applause]
Lorenzo and players waiting in the
center very quick thinking
there
and a decent
delivery well it was never really going
to be of concern to the keeper that
one
Ugarte
mbapp fera well time just challenge
magnificently
[Applause]
[Music]
this attack looks highly
promising a chance to whip it
in oh what a clearance Under Pressure
had to react and
did skipping away Distributing it
well and the decision is one of offside
[Applause]
here Manuel
Ugarte chance for the leveler in it goes
and that changes the moon well they've
got the momentum can they now go and win
this one
isman
zinski
Lindstrom determin
[Applause]
defending just the challenge that was
required
well that's a super ball over the top
well far from the ideal header and the
goalkeeper had it all the
way kangin
Lee oh good Vision it could be for
mbappe well good technique in terms of
how he struck
it substitution it is for
[Applause]
PSG
chance to
cross
[Applause]
demele and just blotting out the
[Applause]
danger textbook defending Inside the
Box
zalinski
[Applause]
well a really good
run and he cuts inside and credit is due
for that good piece of
[Applause]
Defending just 15 minutes
[Applause]
remaining took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop them
[Applause]
and a lot to like about this attack can
he do it to take the lead looked like a
certain goal but that it's got to be and
he's hardly gone and made it a hattick
absolutely unplayable today what a
performance what a big moment in the
dying Embers will it prove decisive here
[Applause]
ruie well possibilities in the
center oim
hen this could be it that is a very fine
challenge in difficult
circumstances he might be able to profit
from the wide
[Applause]
position well with 5 minutes remaining
and just one goal between them still the
prospect of late excitement in this
match wonderful
chance oh it's gone in from bad to worse
scant evidence of a title party here far
from it well this certainly wasn't in
the script was it I just can't see them
getting back into this
one not long to go now and if they are
to offer a response it has to happen
soon well it's just not happening for
them they've come up short when it
matters most unless they can score now
look at this they must score oh a moment
of pure class had to catch it perfectly
and didn't
just
VI and the referee has decided to award
the free kick to
[Applause]
PSG well in terms of added time a
minimum of 1
minute snuffing out the danger but a
corner coming
up and the corner played over by demele
well there we have it the end of the
game an underwhelming performance today
and one that at least for now puts their
title celebrations on Ice well I thought
no two ways about it he really has
brought his influence to bear on the
proceedings well he was on fire today
not just with his finishing but also his
General
play if you're on the left you
say if you're on the right you
say
go let's go
yeah
[Music]
[Music]
yeah
[Music]
[Music]
for
[Music]
now it's for real the tactics and Squad
strengths have all been analyzed by
committed fans and neutral observers a
confrontation that all football lovers
will Revel in knowing that we might be
about to witness a simply unmissable
[Music]
occasion don't move the muscle the ex
excitement in the Parisian air we're at
the pass here in the French Capital I'm
Derek Ray and ready with his tactics
board alongside me is Stuart Robson my
commentary partner and so much on the
line it is the final game of the season
and we're guaranteed to know who will
win the title steers what are you
expecting to see yeah absolutely nothing
to split between the two sides you have
to say it's been a fantastic season back
and forth plenty of drama and now it
just comes down to who holds their
nerves on the big occasion I can't wait
for this Derek
who can he pick
out well a classic example of how to
intercept and here's how the lineup
looks for PSG Jan Luigi donaruma begins
in goal Lucas Hernandez plays with
Ashraf Hakimi in the fullback positions
kangin Lee plays alongside vctor ferera
in central Midfield and the main threat
in attack today should be kilan
mbappe
this is how the visitors will set up
today Alex morett is the goalkeeper
Mario Ruiz starts with Giovani dorenzo
in the fullback positions stanislav
lotka plays alongside piotra ginski in
central Midfield and the Tactical
configuration has two players an attack
from the very
[Applause]
outset given away by
PSG
[Applause]
[Applause]
politano Mario
ruie can he play it
in
difficult to stop
him oim
hen trying to craft
something oh disappointing just when it
looked like a Sure Fire opener well that
should have been the opener Derek I'm
not sure how he's missed
that
poano can they nudge in front well what
a stop that
was
[Applause]
can someone get on the end of this could
still be
dangerous well they can keep possession
now well the outcome is a free kick
here and the keeper stretching to deny
him
demele vtor fera
[Applause]
beautiful
pass
opportunity and fine
[Applause]
goalkeeping and the attacking options
appear plentiful Crossing into the
middle oh good work by The
Keeper
well back and forth in terms of
possession well the visitors very much
dictating the tempo over the last 15
minutes or so and created a hack full of
chances but when you're enjoying that
amount of possession you need to make it
count wanted to keep it but
couldn't
Pano oh danger here he must finish oh
the referee has given it penalty it is
and on the back of that decision now
it's a caution well it's a tight call
but in the end I think he's got it right
a penalty and a yellow card and he SWS
it home with
[Applause]
confidence so underway again here 1 n
the
score
VOR
fera and he might be through here and a
goal Bingo it could happen for them
today and what a crucial goal that could
be in the title race they need to keep
pushing though they do need
another
Pano they've given it
[Applause]
away
[Applause]
zalinski oim
hen and quick thinking
[Applause]
defensively
blee defensive Brazilians to shut them
down
[Applause]
oh tremendous
Vision well there to
intercept and a throw coming up after a
really fine piece of tackling and the
referee has decided to award the free
kick to
PSG good ball to switch the
[Applause]
play very quick thinking
[Applause]
there can they take
advantage oin hen can he put them in
front it's gone in and what a pivotal
goal it could be in terms of the title
race well that really could be it unless
they respond quickly
here
Mario ruie well that one has
promise and with that the attack Fizzles
out there will be one minute added on at
the
[Applause]
end
mbapp
Deele did look as though they might be
onto something for a second or so and
that is the that for the first half here
in the French
Capital so here we go the stars of the
second half at the home of PSG the
pactic
[Applause]
pr nice switch of
play
and an astute piece of
Defending might be a chance to
[Applause]
break well possession
seated vtor fera
here's
marinos and PSG couldn't hang on to
it and a chance for him on the
flank and a decent
delivery spot on with that
[Applause]
tackle fera and the ruling is offside
[Applause]
here
[Music]
Amir
rahmani now Mario
ruie lost
possession and him with a real
chance there is The Equalizer and the
title race takes yet another compelling
twist well that puts a spanner in the
works they've got to refocus
here
Giovani D
[Applause]
Lorenzo the attacking options appear
plentiful and nothing comes of that
[Applause]
attack kangin
Lee 30 minutes left for
play
great vision to switch the
play just knocking it around looking to
carve out a chance oim hen onto
[Applause]
zalinski really vital interception and a
chance for them to nudge in front and
the flag was up in good time it's
offside well he should have realized
that was going to be offside that's a
poor decision to play that
pass and the advantage is with
PSG kangin
Lee and teammates around
him oh mbappe and the keeper really
reacted brilliantly well from that sort
of range it's a great save I have to
say well they've been frustrated for
quite a while now but these fans have
suddenly come to
life well the stats back up what we've
seen so far some good attacking football
chances for both teams and plenty to
enjoy it let's hope for more of the
same this could be
[Music]
Troublesome zelinski they found the net
and who knows it could be the goal that
wins them the championship well it's
theirs for the taking now will that be
the defining
moment lotka and a fine
tackle PS G looking
dangerous but the danger averted for
now now breaking at PACE potential
danger beautiful pass can they make it
count is this the
moment and the ball is loose and a goal
it is what does it mean well it means
silverware could be coming their way
that's a big moment they can't let it
spit out surely it will be a Paris SAR
free
kick
tele could P one back here and the
keeper has possession of
[Applause]
it and into the last 15 minutes of
action and PSG Come Away With
It
Mario
ruie
[Applause]
tempelle trying to craft something
mbappe and there is the goal to make it
a hattick excellence and finishing there
for all to
see Mario
ruy
[Applause]
and a good looking
[Applause]
ball this could finish
it oh a stab piece of
Defending well these PSG fans are
demanding more from their team they need
to find a goal from somewhere
now not long left and they need a goal
from some Source if they are to prevent
their season ending early well they look
like a beaten team to me unless they
score soon their season oh Splendid
header but a fine save if they can score
again from this corner it probably would
be the end of the
story PSG are going to switch things
around on the Personnel
front the defensive intervention
[Applause]
there
going well oim hen really good buildup
but no end
product
Hernandez and the electronic board
showing one additional
minute ready to
fire It's Over Now sheer Joy on one side
but the bitter taste of defeat on the
other well just the sort of performance
they were looking for from The Talented
kilan mbappe yeah he was superb wasn't
he didn't let his head drop demanded
more of his teammates and probably
deserved better for all his effort
[Music]
today oh
