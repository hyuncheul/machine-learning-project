everyone on tenter hooks you can feel
the tension because there's so much on
the line if they win they make it
through to the promotion match it is
that simple till they have the mental
fortitude
[Applause]
necessary drama guaranteed and it's live
coming up next on EA
TV
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be in trolling I'm
Derek Ray and sitting next to me with
his tactics charts at the ready is
Stuart Robson and the Chance is on for
them to reserve for themselves a
promotion match Place how do you see the
match going Stuart well Derek it's
certainly in their hands if they win
here a promotion match will be theirs
they just need to put in a good
performance it won't be easy though
[Applause]
Maya and back with
martinez now will the keeper have to pay
the price for that
mistake oh there it is the mistake
punished to the maximum and the
goalkeeper left distraught huge error
so the action continues and it's up to
internal to show invention and perhaps
level the
game
federo showing a real will to win the
ball oh nice ball over the top that's a
nice looking ball well clattered
away threee kick award then by the
[Applause]
referee and a long way out here well the
bar can be the goalkeeper's best friend
[Applause]
well that would certainly have put them
in a great position but with only a one
goal lead they're never going to be able
to relax yes so near indeed but now
they've got to concentrate on keeping
their defensive
shape internal looking productive
perfect
challenge chance to play it
in
[Applause]
abas has
it well they're behind but they might be
on to something
here oh did well to skip
through the cross is
on
so deflection and it will be a throw
in it did look on for them but not to
[Applause]
be could be dangerous and the ruling is
offside
[Applause]
here so
amam
mea possession lost
intercepted
wall
Reed
Shaka and a good challenge to bring that
attack to an
[Applause]
end and the cross into the middle and a
goal real excitement here The
Equalizer well here's the replay and
it's a really inviting ball played into
the box begging players to attack it and
it ends up with a fairly simple finish
certainly not much the goalkeeper can do
about
that
alexe
wall Very alertly winning back
[Applause]
possession shot attempted oh good
save played over just knocked it out of
there the switch of play play
[Applause]
now
alexe
wall
greed can they trouble the opposition
this
time and a decent delivery well the
keeper wasn't called by it at all the
actual
fact it has gone over the touch line for
what'll be a throw
in successfully cut
[Applause]
out
Reed in the right place to cut out the
pass
and a throw in it's going to
[Applause]
be Reed
now dangerous looking through Ball but
in fact he's taken up an offside
position oh that's frustrating he just
took too long to see the
pass Federico and nicely over the top oh
just miss time his run and the flag
going
up
inight of pass well technically offside
but not by a lot well that's so tight
isn't it but on this occasion he doesn't
get the benefit of the
doubt passing it around looking for the
goal that would put them
ahead interception to Snuff out the
danger not giving him a Moment's
[Applause]
Peace and the referee spotted the foul
but has played advantage and he's
retrospectively awarded the free kick
now having tried to give them the
advantage deserves credit for winning
the ball
back and the fourth official confirming
that we'll have one additional minute
and there it is the halim
whistle
a lot it's
best
[Applause]
well under away once more and it's going
to be fascinating to see what
developments occur in this second
[Applause]
half
and play halted free kick
given Tak it away now who can he play it
[Applause]
to delivered into the box a goal that's
two for him today they simply can't stop
him no wonder he's
celebrating well back underway as we
reflect on the goal that's made it
2-1
alexe
wall
schuma
greed excellent ball over the
top well slightly of Target and that'll
be a throw
in
untiy in
possession International in a position
of potential
Menace
[Applause]
alexe
Reed
now simple catch
really
federo goalkeeper has
[Applause]
it
Maya Martinez with
[Applause]
it
tiam will it be and a goal to seal the
hatrick a master class in finishing just
can't stop him
today so on with the action and three1
the score line at the
moment Reed
now
No Nonsense
clearance that's a good looking
ball can he put it away and a goal Here
There It Is they've done
[Music]
it well here it is again and it's all
about the pace on the Counterattack they
were so quick to break out from their
defensive positions and from there he
never looked like missing that's a
lovely
goal
Alex
Reed
now plenty of support here chance to
finish oh a challenge of the highest
order it's with
martinez Maya
federo really good strong tackle and
it'll be a throw
[Applause]
in did well to win the ball
back 20 minutes
remaining
re having to shoot oh he couldn't outwit
the keeper
can he put it
[Applause]
away abaz has
it unable to hang on to the ball
interasia
now
Reed can he create an
angle managed to get it is out of
[Applause]
there just 15 minutes
[Applause]
remaining Reed
now well it did look promising but no
threat in the
end well breaking at PACE is always a
possibility but it Fizzles out thanks to
that piece of
Defending
and support
available can they convert it was on its
way
[Applause]
in who can they pick out and swept out
of their
there well that ball looks promising
good ball to switch the
play fine cross into the middle oh my
goodness me well don't try that at home
without practice practice practice
breathtaking
goal so the current score line
42
Maya got
well time is ebing away and they're
using this passing approach to marvelous
effect
Marcel and the cross goes in and a goal
to put the final stamp on it that will
do
it well here's the replay and it all
starts off with that cross into the box
just begging for a teammate to get on
the end of it and it ends up with a
fairly simple finish certainly not much
the goalkeeper can do about
that
International losing
possession Reed
now well not quite what he wanted to do
with the
[Applause]
pass abas has
it
well if you're wondering about added
time 2 minutes It'll be and he's lost
custody of the ball
[Applause]
here well they might be able to launch a
Counterattack and a fine cross it comes
to absolutely nothing and that is going
to be that well a tale of Woe in terms
of the score line as far as the visitors
are
concerned play too many players below
part and not enough energy all around
the pitch a really worrying performance
for
[Applause]
me
everyone on tenter hooks you can feel
the tension because there's so much on
the line if they win they make it
through to the promotion match it is
that simple do they have the mental
fortitude
[Applause]
necessary is today the day live on
[Music]

West Ham player Stuart Robson and if

panning out Stuart well Derek a win here

match they just need to keep their nerve
and put in a decent
performance not Advantage with them
referee says play
on oh surely warted by the
[Applause]
post and I think the threat has been
averted
and he did well to cut it
out not to like about that
pass it has to be a truly magnificent
start an early goal in the game just
what they were hoping to
[Applause]
produce so underway again here one M the
score
[Applause]
wall really good buildup but no end
[Applause]
product
I
h
what
a crucial day stands in front of them
the knowledge that a win is required to
make it through to the promotion match
and no doubt about it their opponents
won't be of a mind to do them any favors
at
all stay with us every kick of the ball
is coming up on EA
TV and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be in trolling my
name is Derek Ray and joining me for
commentary is Stuart Robson and if all
goes to plan they can progress to a
promotion match how do you see the match
going Stuart well Derek I think this
will be tense but they know a good
performance and a victory will give them
access to a promotion match it should be
an interesting
game wal
out and the ball's
gone and he's broken
free and goal to open the scoring a very
bright start to this
one now the ball is moving once more how
important will that opening goal prove
to
be and space to cross it well there was
impending danger but good
defending half-hearted
clearance and the attack fizzling out
[Applause]
they couldn't maintain
[Applause]
possession shot attempted and what a
magical save it
was
[Applause]
let's see about the
delivery mopping up
defensively and foul it is
then and fired from the flank into the
area
really fine piece of Defending play to
break us
up
hadu Aguero took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
[Applause]
them not a great Challenge free kick
here well a foul but no yellow card at
this early stage in the opinion of the
referee well he might just be lucky it's
so early on you'll have to be careful
now Reed
now good ball over the
top good looking
cross danger reverted for
[Applause]
now
hadu well we know they can pass the ball
back better than
this well the challenge was clean but
the danger not
cleared brilliant
pass not quite the clearance they were
hoping
[Applause]
for well they can keep possession
now well read to win possession
[Applause]
back now do they mean business on this
occasion a fine reading of the
situation nice looking
[Applause]
pass it be a bit annoyed to have lost
the
[Applause]
ball the oh good
vision and the keeper diving to thwart
him
[Applause]
corner kick played
in emphasis on the clearance a good
one
Reed a good Vision
there that's useful
play
oh what a perfect ball now how about
this trailing but hope in the form of a
[Applause]
corner trying to pick out a
teammate just the clearance that was
called
for that's a well struck pass good ball
to switch the
play how about the
cross a good and fair
Challenge and the counter looks on here
options
available a really top-notch piece of
[Applause]
Defending it's a weighted pass
that is really alert defending just when
the situation looked
dangerous Reed
now and space to cross it he not testing
The Keeper at all with that
[Applause]
[Music]
cross
Walter in a decent position now
[Applause]
out counterattacking
[Applause]
chance a very good
[Applause]
tackle well good looking play with the
ball of
[Applause]
defeat
Aguero almost at halime it's going the
way of the visitors as things stand
Stewart what have you made of what
you've seen well I think they've been
the better side in this first half they
defended well they've looked dangerous
in attack and they've controlled the
Midfield it's been a solid performance
so
[Applause]
far and just one minute of time added on
for
stoppages so the whistle then we're up
the halfway stage in this
[Applause]
match
[Applause]
as
well underway once more and it's going
to be fascinating to see what
developments occur in this second
half oh great
vision well they kept their Shake
defensively job done for
[Applause]
that
[Applause]
Aguero really fine piece of Defending
play to break us up breaking it
Pace not to like about that
pass great ball over the
top and getting in the way of that
superb defensive play oh you don't want
to lose the ball in that position
and the keeper more than equal to
[Applause]
it over it
comes good bit of
Defending and what can they do to stop
him running at them and credit is due
for that good piece of
Defending bingh
Housen a meaty but fair Challenge and it
will be a throwing
Adu well they're behind but they might
be on to something
here it is to be a throw in Tony
everybody loves you and is thinking
about
you well he's allowed it to go over the
touch line so a throw in
[Applause]
and in the right position to read
[Applause]
it
Reed that she could do a bit of damage
it has to
be
still looking for
[Applause]
space and he dealt with that ball played
in rather
well getting in there to
intercept
[Applause]
Def
good tackle taken
[Applause]
away and making the run to the inside oh
might be it's in and looking really
relaxed and confident and not giving the
opposition much of a look
[Applause]
in
well here you can see it again good run
great strength and a composed finish
Under Pressure that's a top glass
goal Aguero now look at this they might
be able to cash in
here getting the better of his opponent
element of risk there but he's won the
[Applause]
ball
[Applause]
green teammates
available but really sticking to their
task
defensively really good ball there
opportunity it
is must be and pure Instinct from The
Keeper well a top class reaction from a
top class goalkeeper brilliant
stuff well a joy to
watch not a very good challenge and he
skips past his
[Applause]
man
and players waiting in the center and
the cross not quite imaginative
[Applause]
enough
hadu and passing it
[Applause]
well well that's common sense referee in
to play
Advantage interception to Snuff out the
danger
wall well the final whistle approaching
and this has certainly been an away Day
to Remember Stuart your assessment well
I think the score line reflects the
difference between the two teams for
most of the game they've dictated the
play and they've created some really
good chances I think it's been an
excellent
performance
and a good looking
ball and the referee has pointed to the
spot penalty given and a red card to add
to the agony Stewart well that sums up
their display they've just been a yard
off the pace today and confidently
[Applause]
converted well if there were any
lingering doubts about the outcome
surely they now have been removed
well nothing comes of it referee
indicates goal
[Applause]
kick and just 5 minutes
remaining and is she going to score from
here and a goal this time applying the
Finishing Touch just what the doctor
ordered
well here it is again and they've taken
their goal well but the defending was
non-existent that should never
happen a lopsided contest
40 well the referee allowing the play to
[Applause]
flow
Def
hadu
[Applause]
bellinghausen and nothing comes of that
attack
the high press was on and the Chan is on
spot on with that
tackle 2 minutes of stoppage time coming
up well they might be able to launch a
Counterattack and it looked like open
road for them but up a dead
end and the referee playing
advantage and so the final whistle here
the visitors come out on top Stewart
You're absolutely right Derek they're
[Applause]
[Applause]
attacking
there can be no denying it this is
crunch time the first promotion match
and no margin for error the players have
simply got to get it right out there on
the
[Applause]
pitch the action is
[Applause]
[Music]
live good evening and welcome ahead of
what should be a pulsating night of
football I'm Derek Ray and sitting next
to me with his tactics charts at the
ready is Stuart Robson and a new
experience for them as they make their
promotion match debut Stuart tell us
about your prematch thoughts well this
is a big game for them yes they've done
well up to this point but this will be
tough today they need to play well
[Applause]
here
alhassan it's a weighted pass well
offside but a tight call well that was
really close it was almost the perfect
run wasn't
it and tily
played cuts it
back
just knocked it out of
there ball lost by
Wanderers a good effective pressure high
up the
pitch what a brilliant pass
and a goal not B for starters they take
an early
[Applause]
lead well here's the replay and what a
well delivered cross this is perfectly
place and then what a great finish as
well good connection with the ball
leaving the keeper with little chance
it's a a great
goal and passing it's
through and he read it
superbly
alhassan nice looking pass dangerous
ball danger averted for
now
and given
away
Ry how about the
cross just the clearance that was called
for fres
and Amos has it
now nice ball to switch the point of
attack precise ball movement well there
was impending danger but good
defending and forcing the
error a Wanderer Corner they're hungry
to add to their
lead
who can they pick
out good piece of
Defending
Reed and that puts them in
position and a goal to square the game
into to the seat
St so underway again here on the back of
that
leveler
[Applause]
KES Reed now intercepted
[Applause]
effortlessly
oh body in the way
crucially a chance now with the
[Applause]
corner over it comes well it still could
be
dangerous he'll be breathing a sigh of
relief ball
one
not to like about that pass and offside
it
[Applause]
is
alhassan and she's in a decent
position passing it around looking for
the goal that would put them ahead and a
goal to reestablish their advantage just
look at the celebration
[Applause]
well here it is again and just look how
he creates this chance that's so
inventive and he makes the Finish Look
So Easy what a good goal that
[Applause]
is
[Applause]
Reed
moving it
Forward oh good defending to stop a
decent looking
[Applause]
attack holding on to what they have is
the priority
apparently would be a bit annoyed to
have lost the
ball well with tackling like that the
onus is on the referee to take action
[Applause]
potentially can he find the right pass
and nicely over the top a glorious
chance oh blocked
it
could be threatening fed over towards
the back post needs to clear it away now
breaking at PACE potential
danger chance to
cross and a goal to increase their
advantage to two overall that little bit
of a cushion now it's all about keeping
the
concentration
[Applause]
so back underway 3-1 the
[Applause]
score if you're wondering about stoppage
time one minute to be added
on alexe Well that took
confidence well that is how to nullify
the opposition
and the managers will now deliver their
halim team talks we're at the end of 45
minutes in this
[Applause]
game
that
well they've got things going again here
and I wonder what kind of second half we
have in store for
[Applause]
us oh really careless they might be
in and teammates to play it to now this
could be productive he's blocked
[Applause]
it who can he pick out immediate
priority to clear the
danger
alhassan really good
challenge and offside I rather think he
was caught in two minds well he just
needed to go elsewhere with his pass he
showed a complete lack of awareness
there
now can he get on the end of this
one can he make it count a goal how
about that he's put it away to make it a
[Applause]
hattick well here it is again just look
at the quality of the Cross it's inch
perfect and the Finish is really well
taken cuz he judges the flight to the
ball uses the right technique and then
make such good contact that's a clever
goal and given
away and a goal it is just what she was
hoping to
contribute well here's the goal again
and what a wonderfully weighted pass
this is and just look at that finish 1 V
one against the keeper and she hits it
with power it's a great
goal so the current score line 4-2
[Applause]
Ry alhassan and he read it
well
wall now what can they do from
here a fine reading of the situation now
the quick counter attack could be
on well they couldn't quite use that
break in the manner that they'd
helped ler to the Box well thumped
clear a very timely
interception
alhassan
and Amos has it
now and he was in the right place to
intercept
Reed a chance to whip it
in an important
interception delightful
pass an utterly disappointing cross goal
kick
wose came away with
[Applause]
it took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
them so deflection and it will be a
throw
in
thres
alhassan interception to Snuff out the
danger and quick thinking
defensively and the Counterattack is on
options
available
[Applause]
[Music]
the referee's letting it go as they keep
the
ball what a genuine opportunity but it
was squandered go
kick 10 minutes to
go potential danger here the clearance
wasn't
decisive
and it goes it looked as though they
were down and out not a bit of it what
will happen
next let's see this again because the
delivery into the box couldn't be any
better played into just the right area
and it's a comfortable finish in the end
which is made to look so easy it's a
lovely
goal
Ry
alhassan and back to the
[Applause]
keeper there might very well be late
excitement 5 minutes left and the margin
just
one this could finish it determined
defending if they can score again from
this corner it probably would be the end
of the
story and there's the
delivery cleared away
comprehensively they know what they need
and that's an equalizer
here this could level it well a wild
swing at the ball in the end that was
what it amounted
[Applause]
to and the pass not quite accurate
enough and a throw in
then
Mumu
Ry
trying to open them
[Applause]
up and that is the end of the contest
and not a happy outcome as far as the
visitors are concerned well Derek it was
a hardfought
[Applause]
contest whether he was running in behind
or dropping into pockets of space he
caused all sorts of problems what a good
hat trick that
was
now
top players on a fitting stage that's
what we're talking about a match of
colossal importance and one that has
captured the imagination of anyone with
an interest in this great game of
football now we're truly ready for what
will be a
showdown we're live next so don't go
anywhere good evening and welcome ahead
of what should be a pulsating night of
football I'm Derek Ray and I'm joined
for expert analysis by Stuart Robson and
on the menu today club's match action
for you to enjoy Stuart how do you see
this one going thanks Derek well both
managers will be reminding their players
of starting the game quickly pinning the
opposition back playing the ball forward
and regaining possession as quickly as
possible hopefully we get a really good
game
here and the referee blows for a
foul
well that's common sense refereeing topl
Advantage another successful
intervention winning the ball
[Applause]
[Music]
back
Alexi read it superbly to take back
possession a chance to whip it
[Applause]
in really good buildup but no end
product
oh it's off the post a decisive
clearance it
[Applause]
was well what a start to the game that
would have been they certainly can't
come closer than
that likes to run with the ball at his
[Applause]
feet
Rooney United might be able to cash
[Applause]
in well unable to make anything of the
Cross
wall chance here not quite the level of
accuracy she was hoping for and that'll
be a goal
[Applause]
kick
[Applause]
couldn't find a teammate throw in
[Applause]
here n a very good
[Applause]
tackle and whipped into the
box
Reed now moving it
Forward has eyes for goal and did just
enough
[Music]
defensively
[Applause]
and over it
comes smuggled
away getting in there to
[Applause]
intercept good ball over the
top can they Forge ahead they do and
you've got to say they're good value for
the
lead and back under way one n it
is Reed now giving the ball to the
opposition that
[Applause]
time and the referee takes exception to
the Challenge free
kick
can he finish this and with that they
thed the
[Applause]
opportunity now counterattacking
possibilities
here the fans are shouting shoot what a
v in position they just couldn't stay in
front and now this match is all
square well here's the replay and he
shows great awareness to play this
through ball and the movement is good
making for a comfortable finish it's a
really great
goal so underway again here on the back
of that
[Applause]
leveler well Foul Play says the referee
[Applause]
that's a well struck
pass well just trying to drive her team
forward here well the goalkeeper making
sure he avoided a
[Applause]
mishap and that'll be
offside
Reed very alert defending to put a stop
to the
chance United could be on to
[Applause]
something the clearance wasn't decisive
an alert piece of
[Applause]
Defending well the timing was perfect
ball
one well as you can see the hosts have
had most of the ball but without really
creating too many chances which when you
look at the Players out on the pitch
it's really disappointing they need to
play with far more urgency to win this
game no doubt they go to work moving it
around
again really vital interception
here good looking
cross every goalkeeper would expect to
catch that one
[Applause]
so the whistle then we're up the halfway
stage in this
[Applause]
match
okay
a
well they've got things going again here
and I wonder what kind of second half we
have in store for
[Applause]
us still passing it around with
authority and passing it well and he's
clear as
[Applause]
lines using his strength to Shield the
[Applause]
ball and space for them here on the
flank good looking move oh could be and
the goalkeeper has outdone himself with
that save well they haven't created too
much lately but the fans know this is a
chance to take the lead
[Applause]
here
played over real need to get rid of
[Applause]
it oh lovely weighted ball they might be
in and Beyond the last Defender
offside
[Applause]
wall Reed
now
Distributing it well well clattered
[Applause]
away and teammates to play it to angles
it back great
[Applause]
defending a very effective play in
possession that's a good ball oh
disappointing
[Applause]
clearance and I think the threat has
been
averted now counterattacking
possibilities not away
completely now a decent
position well that's the foul and it
sets up a free kick in a dangerous
position it didn't have the beating of
the wall
unfortunately the cross is
on he read the situation defensively and
did his
job and a useful
cross and crossed in the direction of
the back post well didn't really work
the keeper when all was said and
done and losing
possession
they do like to press whenever they
[Applause]
can and it cross the touch line so a
throw in
[Applause]
here and in the right position to make
sure it didn't go all the way
through
and space to cross
it he's going forward well here oh
that's a super piece of
[Applause]
Defending good tackle it'll be a
throw oh really careless they might be
in just can't get it past him
well it clearly was deflected so it will
be their throw
in intercepted
effortlessly so a throw in
[Applause]
here good looking sequence still looking
for space well that's the sign of a well
organized defense the pressure was high
and they could be in here and she puts
it away just what they wanted to see
from
her what a big moment in the dying
Embers will it prove decisive
here and Under Pressure that was a a
fine
[Applause]
claim getting forward but a good piece
of Defending to bring it to an end oh
what a top notch
pass opportunity here and a goal another
one two and quick succession no wonder
than
celebrating well here it is again it's a
wonderfully weighted ball over the top
while the movement in the box is equal
to it it's such good timing what a
goal underway again with the score at
3-1 not to like about that
pass 10 minutes left for
play so almost at full time and the home
side very much in command Stuart what
have you made of their overall
performance well they've been much the
better side up to now some of their
approach play has been excellent they
just need to control possession for
these final few minutes to cap off a
really good
[Applause]
display
wall good ball over the
top Crossing opportunity in the right
place to cut out the
pass now breaking at PACE potential
danger but they took care of the
situation
defensively
[Applause]
alexe could be
[Applause]
dangerous and there the move ends for
[Applause]
now now
[Applause]
couldn't find a teammate throw in
[Applause]
here tremendous intuition to win it back
and it's a quality
pass could be and now it is there for
