when you find yourself bottom of the
table in the playoffs there can be no
sweet talking it the time is now and the
players know it they've got to up the
game can they do it with this challenge
facing them head
on we're live on
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
eatv and welcome into a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be olling my name
is Derek Ray and sitting alongside me
ready to provide all the analysis is
Stuart Robson and it's going to be
fascinating to see how these two sides
fa as they come up against each other
what do you anticipate seeing Stuart
well it's not been good for this side
during the playoffs but if they can get
something from this game it might just
rebuild their confidence for the rest of
the matches let's hope
so
[Applause]
and it took a little Nick before it went
over the touch line so a throw in
[Applause]
here
Stone and De Young on the
ball a very good
tackle
beautiful
pass he'll be delighted to have won the
ball having made that difficult
[Applause]
challenge
[Applause]
so that's effective pressure high up the
pitch well a very important record
broken last time out you're looking at
the club's new all-time top scorer
yeah what a goal scorer but I'm sure
there's still a lot more to come oh wait
Stuart they might score and you've just
witnessed a moment of truly high class
goalkeeping you're absolutely right what
a save that is he's reacted so
quickly well the keeper is Happy the bar
was there good bit of
[Applause]
Defending very quick thinking there
and it's gone behind for the
corner and he clears the
[Applause]
danger
[Applause]
so
Sabah in behind for him to
Chase
to put them ahead and a goal to give
them the lead they have their
[Applause]
reward well back underway and one n it
is let's see what happens
next
bler Santa
Cruz
Anthony no high quality
defending that's a good looking ball
really good buildup but no end product
and a goal another one two in quick
succession no wonder they cele
cing so back underway with the lead
standing at
[Applause]
2-n
Blair
Anthony oh good looking run rocked it
brilliantly well that's how to keep the
opposition at Bay
[Applause]
peric well when you have the lead you
can play in this manner keeping the ball
like this
[Applause]
Jin and
Fernandez and a tidy
tackle
petkovic
Stone Santa
Cruz and the cross goes in oh he failed
to deliver that
time
doing well to win it back what can they
do from
here really first straight
Challenge
theong and a decent delivery not really
the ideal
clearance and players waiting at the far
post but keeper ball they'll be
disappointed with that delivery
so well on the cusp of the halime
interval and they're not really enjoying
this away day are they Stuart your take
well they can certainly play better than
this they've been too slow in possession
and not aggressive enough with their
closing down those two things have to
change in the second half if they're to
turn this
around cuts it
back superb looking
pass and not cleared away
properly danger RS it for
now that's useful play that's a useful
cross and a goal it is but offside is
the verdict well it's a good finish but
he was just offside great decision by
the
assistant
sabba well they a bit like a passing
machine and you can understand why they
want to play it that way in front as
they are and passing it
[Applause]
well ball lost by
Wanderers there will be one minute added
on at the end options in the
[Applause]
middle takes the shot oh it's a own goal
a moment he would love to be able to
[Applause]
forget and there it is the halim
[Applause]
whistle
I
like
so the two teams have switched around
and the second half is
[Applause]
[Applause]
underway
and winning it
[Applause]
back
so well the fans want to see a shot
determined defending and maybe scope for
wos to add to their advantage with this
set
[Applause]
piece
over it comes oh good save excellent
header Corner coming
up really fine catch by the goalkeeper
under a bit of pressure
too
Anthony
so effective
challenge well he certainly not
alone
and it's played into the center oh great
header Smart Stop
though struggling to hold on to the
[Applause]
ball
perisic and for
andz and so 30 minutes left for play in
this
one really good buildup but no end
product
so now can they make something
happen
chance to
cross shown
[Applause]
inside
Sabah good looking
sequence
but a good piece of Defending to bring
it to an end Wanderers pushing to add to
their lead it'll be a
[Applause]
corner can someone get on the end of
this not the result from the set piece
they were looking
for onto D
young
Stone there to win it
back just 20 minutes remaining
now cross could be
useful and thumped
away beautiful
pass and there it breaks down but credit
to the defense
tickets for the next game are available
for sale after today's
game
Stone and whipped into the box well you
can't really and turned onto the
[Applause]
woodwork now sending it
[Applause]
in
that's a good looking
ball genuine chance has to be there it
is and he could scarcely have had an
easier
finish now the action continues and no
shortage of goals 3-1 has things
[Applause]
stand it's with Santa
Cruz
Stone excellent assessment of the
situation at the
[Applause]
back really being closed down and a goal
kick
[Applause]
given
Stone well this game is almost in the
history books and it's not going to be
one the visitors will want to remember
for long St it well they've been second
best that's for sure and the main
problem has been in Midfield where
they've been overrun at times they just
haven't oh a goal to reduce the deficit
my goodness that gets the pot boiling
it's not over
yet well here's the replay and it's a
simple finish in the end but where was
the defending that's just not good
enough
Jin well nothing like annoying your
opponents when you have such an
effective passing
game a good Vision there took a really
smart piece of Defending to stop
them
[Applause]
dong
[Applause]
so oh great vision it comes to
absolutely
[Applause]
nothing and that is going to be that
well a tale
[Applause]
of
felt
for
now it is for Real the tactics and Squad
strengths have been analyzed by
committed fans and neutral observers to
the end degree a confrontation that all
football lovers will Revel in knowing
that we might be about to witness is a
simply unmissable occasion who will come
out on
top live on EA
[Applause]
TV one of the great things about
football is that no one knows for sure
what's going to happen let's see what
unfolds here tonight I'm Derek Ray
perched here on the commentary Gantry
and sitting along side me to provide
expert analysis is Stuart Robson and
it's going to be fascinating to see how
these two sides fare as they come up
against each other Stuart what are you
expecting thanks Derek well both
managers will be reminding their players
of starting the game quickly pinning the
opposition back playing the ball forward
and regaining possession as quickly as
possible hopefully we get a really good
game
here can he finish this oh that is an
outrageously good stop well great re
reflexes from The Keeper he did
brilliantly
there who can he pick
out oh that's a super piece of
Defending
Özil
rakan well I'm sure his heart is beating
extra quickly because it's his debut
game today Stuart what should we expect
to see from him well he certainly given
them some quality in those wide areas
he's a good runner with the ball he can
deliver good crosses and he has a real
change of pace so I'm looking forward to
his performance
today and they'll get ready for the
throw
in
stone
dong really clever
pressing see some progress with the ball
at his feet a fine reading of the
situation this looks promising looking
towards the back
post over the touch line for a throw
in
possession lost and the referee is quite
rightly letting it
go
[Music]
Marcel and it's played into the
center oh Majestic finish he's going to
be rightly proud of that moment
[Applause]
magnificent
well the ball is moving once more how
important will that opening goal prove
to
be
[Applause]
Keller
un tidy in
[Applause]
possession
Keller and he read it
well has eyes for goal they just
couldn't stay in front and now this
match is all square
so back underway one goal a piece
here
Marcel
rakan now plays with a positional sense
that is second to
none it's a neat move and delivered into
the box well the keeper wasn't fooled by
it at all an actual
fact excellent
Vision
Kim
Ibrahimovic not the best
clearance can he take advantage oh that
is a majestic goal
Voli home with precision and style
superbly
[Applause]
done
[Applause]
Ken well there's a living breathing
example of positional
sense now with
Maldini Smith on the ball
released it
nicely it is to be a throw
[Applause]
in
Özil could
be that's well blocked oh good hands
there from The
[Applause]
Keeper
and defensive play to be
[Applause]
applauded Santa
Cruz promising
pass good looking cross and they deal
with the threat this
time
Ibrahimovic lost
possession
[Applause]
[Applause]
Anthony it's with Santa
Cruz Keller now look at this they might
be able to cash in
here
well possibilities in the
center trailing but hope in the form of
a
corner who's going to get on the end of
it well not away
properly well they can keep possession
now and plenty of room in the wide
area but he could run onto it here
appeared to be in two
[Applause]
finds will he play it
[Applause]
in and there it is the halim
[Applause]
whistle
okay
away they go again second half is
underway
here it's a good looking ball Crossing
into the
middle what a lovely strike lethal piece
of finishing drilled home with true
conviction tremendous
goal
Blair
Anthony getting the ball forward well
nothing comes of it it looked
promising and it crossed the touch line
so a throw in
[Applause]
here and that's aggravating for a
manager giving it away like
that
doing well to win it back what can they
do from here deciding to go
inside in goes the cross but absolutely
no support
there so a goal kick is what's coming up
here
untiy on the
ball in
position look like a certain goal but
that's a great
[Applause]
challenge it's with Santa
Cruz the concession of a corner
here
[Applause]
and there's the delivery well there was
impending danger but good
[Applause]
defending
Özil the switch of play
now Marcel
and back now with
Cristiano great effort to keep that one
in
play
Keller
Anthony chance here shot block but still
alive took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
them a chance to whip it
in throw in's
given
they might be able to get in
now big
chance wonderful
block he couldn't drop his guard even
for a fleeting moment Under Pressure
there the keeper langage will not be
Toler in the stadium thank
you Keller well a good
tackle 20 minutes
remaining
options in the center can he get one
back tremendous defending to Stone Wall
him and offside by rather a
[Applause]
lot
Keller well using the space really well
you've got to
say a fine reading of the situation
from a long way
out well the pass not finding its
Target oh beating his opponent with ease
and the ball is
loose and Kim with
it
Özil
Kim will it
be and the corner kick the referee's
verdict over it comes oh stopped on the
line well behind for another
Corner danger still
on 10 minutes left for
play and back with
[Applause]
Kim and Kim with
it he has time to play it
over over the touch line for a throw
in what an earth happened
there
Anthony good ball over the top No
Nonsense
clearance
well that takes the wind out of their
sails great
defending and a throw coming up after a
really fine piece of
tackling Under Pressure doesn't seem to
be bothering him effective press the
referee letting it go as they keep the
ball
Cristiano
Marcel
and he's given his
[Applause]
away good
distribution and there it breaks down
but credit to the defense well that's
gone out and it is going to be a goal
kick
good looking ball there could be a
chance
now oh that's a super piece of
Defending and that is the end of the
contest and not a happy outcome
[Applause]
as was normal and I don't think they
deserved anything from the game they
need to get a better performance in next
time
out
one
this is it a can't miss game and a
backdrop to match what is a special
occasion the fans had this one circled
on their calendars long ago and now it's
a matter of who will dominate on the
pitch top players big characters on the
big stage a highly exciting
prospect it's coming up
live
[Applause]
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be olling my name is
Derek Ray and my commentary partner on
this occasion is Stuart Robson and on
the menu today club's match action for
you to enjoy Stuart what are your
expectations for today thanks Derek well
both managers will be reminding their
players of starting the game quickly
pinning the opposition back playing the
ball forward and regaining possession as
quickly as possible hopefully we get a
really good game
here must be an early goal it is the
ideal
opening so the match has restarted 1 n
here Keller useful looking position
you've got to
say oh it comes to nothing in the end
really should have made more of
[Applause]
that well you never quite know who's
going to emerge from the shadows and
become a match winner but this man might
be a decent shout what are you expecting
to see from him Stuart well he's a
fantastic striker of the ball and he can
generate so much pace and when he
strikes it cleanly the ball starts to
dip and swerve on its way to the
goalkeeper which is why he needs to be
closed down quickly today
[Applause]
it needs an accurate cross and a No
Nonsense
[Applause]
clearance who can they pick
out not too fussy in clearing his
lines
that's a useful cross well in fact a
good but straightforward Claim by The
Keeper
Keller couldn't keep
it and back with Kim in behind for him
to
chase that's a very fine claim Under
Pressure BL reminder that foul and
abusive language will not be Toler and
Young on the
[Applause]
ball Santa Cruz an advantage coming into
play and rightly
so
Stone bler and scope for them to produce
something
exciting and intercept
again and out of play the pass nearly
worked out but not
quite and clears the
danger
Anthony well a good
tackle oh lovely
ball
it has to be well a suspect piece of
finishing when all is said and done and
he'll been thinking about that for quite
some while that's a tame
[Applause]
finish strong but fair
tackle great
opportunity tou on to the woodwork well
another wonderful save to add to his
portfolio
Anthony wilting under the pressure and
now they tried to go
forward
[Applause]
ibraimovic opportunity in the wide
area but a good piece of Defending to
bring it to an end that's a good looking
ball
it's got to be couldn't quite hang on oh
and he puts away the second chance but
the goalkeeper angry with himself
here and D Young on the
ball it's with Santa Cruz couldn't hang
on to
[Applause]
it
[Applause]
now what can they do from
here the cross is
on unable to trouble the defense with
that
cross Kim superb looking pass and he's
gone into an illegal position
unfortunately
theong a really single-minded piece of
Defending to make sure nothing unto
[Applause]
happened oh nice ball over the top and
there it is still life left in this game
and they have the momentum
now
so on with the match 2-1 is the score
line what's going to happen
next
when you find yourself bottom of the
table in the playoffs there can be no
sweet talking it the time is now and the
players know it they've got to up the
game can they do it with this challenge
facing them head
[Applause]
on is today the day live on
[Applause]
eatv and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be enrolling I'm
Derek Ray and keeping me company here on
the commentary Gantry is
Stuart
the fact of the matter is they're not
where they want to be in the playoffs at
the moment bottom of the table but with
a real commitment to Improvement let's
see if that will be evident out there on
the pitch
today
keep it right here for live coverage on
EA
[Applause]
TV good evening and welcome ahead of
what should be a pulsating night of
football I'm Derek Ray your match
commentator and alongside providing all
the Tactical analysis is Stuart Robson
and the stage is set for club's match
action what do you anticipate seeing
Stuart yeah thanks Derek well the
playoffs have been tough for this side
so far they come into this one bottom of
the table but if they show some fight
and determination they can certainly get
something from this game even if it's
just a bit of
Pride good
[Applause]
tackle plenty of four forward momentum
here but can they
produce and that will be a
[Applause]
corner played
over just the clearance that was
needed well it works like this breaking
the club's goal scoring record brings
you attention well as you mentioned the
record was broken last time out but
expect more today this is a player
that's hungry for goals and has the
ability to keep scoring
them and D Young on the
ball the timing was perfect ball
[Applause]
one
[Applause]
Stone real determination and the
challenge a throw in
here well read to win possession back
cross towards that far
post cleared
[Applause]
away
Keller
now far from a smooth challenge now will
the referee produce a
card and a confident
clearance
let's get the latest on the injury
situation from our pitchside man Jeff
shes from down here it looked as though
he landed actually on top of his elbow
that's why he's in so much discomfort
and that's why of course the bench are
so concerned cheers
Jeff Top Class defending that's a foul
and it will be a potentially dangerous
free kick
[Applause]
message for J hello Jay celebrating your
birthday happy birthday J from and just
a bit too much he on that one but more
than decent well he couldn't quite get
it down in time could he what a good
effort that
was excellent ball over the
top
[Applause]
direct ball into the
box and he knows he must thump it
away and a timely intervention well
could be in hot water here booked
already that's useful
play really fine piece of Defending play
to break us
up
Blair oh big
opportunity and the referee blows for a
[Applause]
foul
Anthony well couldn't quite find his
teammate
and Young on the
ball
Anthony oh nice ball over the
top and snuffed out the danger
immediately well it's a good-looking
position is there a goal in the
future
that's a good looking
ball well there to
intercept
bler
Stone keeping it moving
dynamically oh might be
[Applause]
and nicely over the top and the keeper
taking care of the
[Applause]
situation
ji oh they have it
again it's with Santa
Cruz
BL Santa
Cruz and losing
possession
now who can he pick out a good and fair
challenge took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
[Applause]
them the referee has decided there will
be just one minute of added time well
possibilities in the center well it did
look promising but no threat in the
end
and the whistle is sounded for halime in
this
game
[Applause]
like so back underway here into the
second
[Applause]
half Santa
Cruz lot to like about that pass they
dealt with that ball
comfortably
ke
working so hard to win back
possession now
Keane well good run this now what can he
do with it oh that is a majestic goal
voling home with precision and style
superbly done
and back onway one nil it
[Applause]
is now with D
young
[Applause]
Stone
[Applause]
good ball over the
top well timed
[Applause]
tackle that is's allowed it to go over
the touch line so a throw
in well the Wayside haven't BST The
Possession as you can see but when they
have won it back in Midfield areas their
counterattacking has been excellent
they'll be happy with the way the game's
going at the moment well that's right
preserving the lead and doing it really
well and defensive play to be
applauded and space to cross it he got
in the way of that cross clearly took a
touch on the way out of play so a throw
in to
come and nothing comes of that attack
well breaking at PACE is always a
possibility well that break looks so
promising but nothing coming from
it the
young and quick thinking
[Applause]
defensively and TI
play and the cross into the
middle so after that a goal kick it'll
[Applause]
be
Anthony he's given it
away
davino
[Applause]
needed to be more accurate than that
from the keeper and a throw in
[Applause]
then
[Applause]
Blair s to the
keeper Keller
[Applause]
dong just wasn't going to give that ball
away Keane now counterattacking
possibilities oh tremendous
Vision possibilities Inside the Box
and he read it well
defensively what a vital intervention
well goal kick just as it was looking
[Applause]
promising wanted to keep it but
couldn't
now do they mean business on this
[Applause]
occasion franking at
PACE all hands on deck oh surely oh an
excellent save and they're still alive
well that really would have been it
they're still in it here but they're
going to have to be
quick and over comes the corner terrific
of anticipation and a good take under
Jess
[Applause]
there
ji and showing fine Vision but it looked
as though he might be on to something
but his timing left a bit to be desired
yeah that's frustrating cuz he's just
been too impatient there he doesn't need
to make his movement quite so
early and Anthony textbook closing down
and now they're on the
attack good play it in and the cross not
quite accurate
[Applause]
enough well they no longer have the
[Applause]
ball well almost at full time and this
is not really what the home fans had in
mind Stuart interested to get your
thoughts as always well they've
certainly lacked a goal threat up to
this point there's been little invention
no real combination play around the Bots
and the crosses have been erratic but
there is still time to find that moment
of
inspiration well it clearly was
deflected so it will be their throw
in well he went strongly into the
challenge and the result is a throw
[Applause]
in well the electronic board showing one
additional minute
well slightly off Target and that'll be
a throwi
[Applause]
[Applause]
in and that is the end of the game it
goes into the history books as a home
defeat well Derek it was a hard fault
contest which neither side completely
[Applause]
dominated
you
all
the stage is set and the tension is
palpable 90 minutes of what should be
highly entertaining and absorbing
football to come and it would take a
brave person indeed to predict the
outcome what an enticing
Prospect and we're with you every step
of the way live coverage here on EA
TV one of the great things about
football is that no one knows for sure
what's going to happen let's see what
what unfolds here tonight I'm Derek Ray
positioned here on the commentary Gantry
and alongside me at the microphone is
Stuart Robson and delighted to be
bringing you club's match action how's
it going to go Stuart well Derek we can
talk about coaches and their methods but
it's now down to the players which ones
are going to stand out who will affect
the game and who will have the greater
desire it should be a cracking game
though can he put it away well good
hands there from The
Keeper
[Applause]
wanders came away with
it
[Applause]
so that's a good looking
ball well you never quite know who's
going to emerge from the shadows and
become a match winner but this man might
be a decent shout what are you expecting
to see from him Stuart well somehow the
goalkeeper got to
[Applause]
[Applause]
it now sending it in on a corner like
that every goalkeeper's dream
really oh what a top-n
[Applause]
pass and getting in the way of that
superb defensive play he's enjoying
space chance to play it
[Music]
in
well read to put an end to that
attack and now with
Fernandes decent progress with the ball
at his feet well nothing comes of it it
looked
promising
theong
Blair
[Applause]
D young and easily
intercepted good use of Advantage
[Applause]
there options in the middle oh good
defending to stop a decent looking
attack
[Applause]
Jin weros couldn't hang on to
it and Young on the
ball
Anthony onto D
[Applause]
young wers have it
[Applause]
back that's a lovely
ball oh given away oh beating his
opponent with
ease can he put them in
front well that's how to do it inside
your own penalty
area and a very good
challenge
now with
dong passing it around looking for the
goal that would put them ahead oh big
opportunity and punched
away and now with
Fernandes and a useful cross lightly can
he put it away and it's in one n they've
breached the defense
[Applause]
so the match has restarted 1 n
here
Keller
[Applause]
Blair
[Applause]
Keller well read to ease the
[Applause]
pressure plenty of room for the
wanderer's
attack he's got to
score
and the Young on the
ball
Keller so a throw in
[Applause]
here oh genuine
[Applause]
chance so deflection and it will be a
throw
in
now plays with a positional sense that
is second to
none but on the cusp of the halftime
interval and it would be wrong to say
that they're really enjoying this a day
up to this point anyway Stuart well I've
been a little disappointed with their
attacking play it's all been a bit too
slow if they can pass into their front
areas with more quality SW play quicker
and be more positive in 1 V one
situations I think they'll get back into
[Applause]
this
Jin so the whistle then we're at the
halfway stage in this
[Applause]
match
best
so back in business we're into the
second half wo's lead but this a long
way from being done and
dusted The Defenders know you can't
really allow space like that but a good
piece of Defending to bring it to an
end pesic
[Applause]
well that is how to play
[Applause]
Advantage oh surely wasted chance easy
for the goalkeeper and now we find out
it was offside
anyway
[Applause]
Anthony chance to
cross
moving the ball really well
here well it was a good-looking sequence
but it comes to an
end
[Applause]
pesic
Jin well passing moves like this will
keep confidence levels
up Crossing
opportunity PS it back Splendid
defending well breaking at PACE is
always a
possibility and wo's in possession
[Applause]
again well the pressure was intense and
she knew
[Applause]
it St
[Applause]
Anthony
Keller well they stopped them in their
tracks They really pressing their
[Applause]
opponents
so
[Applause]
and snuffed out the danger immediately
but he was under a bit of stress but
back to the
keeper
Blair Anthony this might be ideal for
the
[Applause]
counter and nothing comes of that
attack
and this deliv it crucial intervention
just then amid impending
danger well there's an example of how to
press high
up the referee allowing advantage to a
crew to
[Applause]
them looking for that final pass and for
that chance to level the game
oh back at the m and a debut goal to
boot it doesn't get much better than
that so the ball is rolling again at one
all a wilting under the pressure and now
they try to go
forward alach please give to reception
your is waiting for you
can he find someone at the far
post with the game level let's see what
they can do with this
[Applause]
corner blade
over they've only gone and grabbed
another one two goals in quick
succession now they have have the lead
no wonder they're
celebrating so good use of Advantage by
the
referee now we're inside the final 15
minutes what can Wanderers do from this
position well they have the advantage
that's good
[Applause]
refereeing now the cut back well a CH
Notch piece of defensive
[Applause]
judgment possession lost by Wanderers
great ball over the
top pivotal moment
defensively we just listen to this crowd
they want a bit more they know there's
still plenty of time to find an
equalizer surely they get another chance
maybe
[Applause]
two they're showing a willingness to
attack as they must given the
circumstances time running
[Applause]
out
Anthony now Advantage coming into play
and rightly so a very alertly winning
back
possession great
[Applause]
opportunity that's a well struck
[Applause]
pass cross could be useful well the
cross was acceptable but no one there to
thump at home nicely timed tackle oh
skipping
