then so the deadlock broken then one n
the
score
yaguchi
Nakayama good tackle and a good
clearance I think he could well have
taken a chunk out of the player's leg
with that
challenge well
played possession lost
good
football excellent coverage from the
defender offside called I think caught a
little unawares there that's a good
decision by the linesman I think
good passing
there and it's gone in the keeper well
beaten he'll be pleased with up good
finishing well worth another look at the
goal
then the score now 2- n and some concern
on the
bench nakanishi
neat pass
there
SE wouldn't let him pass
there
Lee and he's drilled the ball home
without the keeper even seeing it I
think what a great goal yeah great goal
nothing the keeper could do about that
and the score here now 3-0 and they're
firing on all cylinders at the
[Applause]
moment
Joe
Lee cled him down well
there good movement
the defender stayed calm Under Pressure
there
Joe
Nakayama and he's hit the post the ball
crawls over the goal line and somehow
Finds Its way into the back of the net
but the keeper won't be happy with that
that was painful the ball seemed to will
itself over the
lane 31 then the score now and the lead
reduced to two
goals superb
skill the ball taken clear by the
defender
Joe and possession given
away good
control SEO oh tipped Away Great save he
did well to stop that not the easiest to
sa and he did well there good
effort the ball played out then by The
Keeper the match referee whistles for
the end of the half and some of the
players in need of a rest Cris quite a
tough contest this it's a bit of a shot
go in 3-1 down at half time I can't see
them settling for that wouldn't surprise
me to see a couple of substitutions
after the
[Applause]
interval the match official prepar to
get this game started again for the
second
half the referee starts the second half
then
the ball glued to his
feet
lishu oh good
ball a player in an offside position
there and the referee pulling play
back SEO
excellent coverage there yes good
control it was expecting a lot to score
from there I think and the ball played
long up the
field Lee a good stop then from the
keeper and that won't beat the keeper
more than equal to the shot
Joe perfect long ball played
through and cleared
away good
touch keeping the ball
here Sav by the
crossbar
aita well chased down
there that's produced a fine save from
the goalkeeper it's a save shouldn't
have had to make the defense should have
closed them
down and someone just string offside I
think
Nakayama
Joe the ball given away then and the
long ball well executed
there that's got to hurt
the ball played
clear the ball played
on a good attent then just wide of the
goal the teams reshape again then goal
kick
Taken good
pass excellent
control it's gone in and there in fact
is the hattick looked on the cards for
some time and he really made it count
there good finishing he's made the
defenses like Miser out there great goal
[Applause]
4-1 here now and the crowd enjoying
this
Choy
say possession
lost yes a quality save from The Keeper
he'll be pleased with that yeah that's a
great
save
Joe and the long ball play to Perfection
there little time for them to get back
into this
now read the pass early good
cover and no way past the
defender brought under control
yes it's there a fine finish and the
keeper well beaten that's Cru
finishing so another look at the goal
[Applause]
then a fresh pair of legs brought on the
field here then the referee checks with
his officials and Blows the Whistle for
the end of the match the fulltime score
here 51 some of the finishing was first
class but the less said about the
defending the
[Applause]
better for
