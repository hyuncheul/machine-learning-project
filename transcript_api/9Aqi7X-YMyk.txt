a game that speaks for itself in so many
ways a stadium hello and welcome to one
of the most recognizable venues in World
football the estadio Santiago bernu here
in Madrid my name is Derek Ray and my
commentary partner as usual is Stuart
Robson and with the title seemingly
slipping from the grasp they've got to
make sure they have everything buttoned
up in this game it's Real Madrid facing
Barcelona it's a situation to be in
Derek they know any slip up here and
it's over they've just got to get a
positive result one way or
another this is the moment what a
block and the starting players for Real
Madrid Kea begins in goal Antonio Huda
plays alongside David Alaba in central
defense federo Val play alongside Jude
Bellingham in the center of Midfield and
the Tactical configuration has two
players an attack from the very
outset teammates
available and here's the starting 11 for
Barcelona Mark Andre toan stands between
the posts Frankie D young plays
alongside ilai gundan in central
Midfield and get in possession to give
them the lead maybe and able to get a
body in the way
the short Corner
routine and a good challenge to bring
that attack to an
end a corner right on the back of the
last
one but he's gone short with
it D
[Applause]
young well the Defenders know they need
to get tighter can't really allow runs
like
[Applause]
that
carva well you never quite know who's
going to dominate a game in advance but
I think you can maybe make an argument
for this fellow Stewart what do you
think we'll see from
him
today well Derek when he's on form when
he's focused he's a brilliant Runner
with the ball he can take on players he
can can go past people with E and he's
got a great shot on him as well I'm
really looking forward to watching him
play
today options in the
middle and still trying to get the shot
off plays it back they' found the net
and who knows it could be the goal that
wins them the championship well it's
theirs for the taking now will that be
the defining
moment venicius J
space here for
Barcelona good play is
in
canel he loves drifting in off the
flank
pedri and routine for the keeper in the
end the cross far too close to
[Applause]
him
valde regain
[Applause]
possession venicius
Jr
and with that the attack Fizzles
out Frankie D
young and the flag has gone up here
offside the
[Applause]
decision and it will be a free kick to
Real
[Applause]
Madrid David
[Applause]
Alaba
Bellingham that's a lovely ball No
Nonsense
[Applause]
clearance read it
well David
[Applause]
Alaba
levandowski is it going to be nicely
saved
Venus
[Applause]
Jun now they stopped them in their
[Applause]
[Applause]
tracks and Barcelona winning the ball
back
[Applause]
Rodrigo now with
levandowski canet
back
Tores still looking for space an alert
piece of
Defending
levandowski in terms of added time a
minimum of one minute
levandowski real chance and still an
opportunity well nothing un toward
toward
happened and the first half is in the
history books here at the
bernabo
like
into the second half then and Barcelona
hold the advantage but a long way from
being
settled well a good t
Torres a chance to whip it
in can they slot it home well thank
goodness for the goalkeeper well they're
calm now but that initial save was
absolutely
magnificent David
alabaran
this is cross Bara regaining
possession making considerable progress
with the
[Applause]
ball and let's give credit to the
defending dong onto
Canelo will he finish and now it is
there for him and a goal is what does it
mean well it means silverware could be
coming their way that's a big moment
they can't let it slip now
surely so the ball rolling again two- n
the
score
Mandy this is
[Applause]
CR Mandy has it venicius
J
can he find the
angle could reduce the
deficit oh the keeper made it look
routine it was anything
but well could this be the Turning Point
the fans are certainly hoping
[Applause]
so good bit of
Defending now perhaps they can counter
from here
now can they take
advantage the cross is on very quick
thinking
there Tony
C they find themselves in a position of
Menace and the referee sensitively
allowing them to carry on Advantage with
them and to reduce the
deficit opportunity and able to get a
body in the
[Applause]
way and fired over by CL and that is not
going to help the cause the header well
Off the
[Applause]
Mark no let up on the pressing
front
levandowski oh this looks useful can he
take advantage alabar with the
block can he
convert well it really looked as though
that was going to be another goal from
him well a chance res second there
probably should have done a bit better
there
really now sending is in and he scored
not once but twice they simply cannot
stop him and no wonder he's enjoying
himself federo
Val this is
cross Venus
J this is
co they've regained
possession
and teammates around him oh good work to
deny the
[Music]
opportunity corner kick delivery from
Tony
CL oh tremendous goal technical
Excellence to finish that one off
wonderful to have that in your
repertoire that's a tale of four goals
in this match now 31 it is
Frankie D
young but he keeps
[Applause]
going but nothing comes of
it
Mandy just cutting off the supply
Tony
CR Mandy has
itel just 10 minutes to
go well they knew they had to give it a
go but could it be they have run out of
steam and their title dreams will be
dashed well I can't believe how poor
they've been today they've lacked quity
and they've not shown enough fights
that's not a good
combination the verdict is offside
[Applause]
here
Torres he continues his
run and let's give credit to the
defending Carvajal being hounded
gundan
pedri determined
defending
[Applause]
[Applause]
dong
difficult to stop him and credit is due
for that good piece of
Defending we are going to have two
additional
minutes
pedri it's with joal
Canelo cross couldn't keep
it
Canelo and chance for Canelo and there
it is that will put the seal on Victory
if there and there goes the final
whistle the celebrations will shortly be
in full swing but let's focus on the
team that has come in second best well
they've been short All Season obviously
they were hoping to take it to the next
game but it never looked like he did it
real contrasting emotions out
there well this is special for everybody
at the
club
