game that speaks for itself in so many
ways a stadium bursting at the scams
with excitement and two terrific teams
ready to give it everything in their
quest for Glory the kind of match that's
impossible to take your eyes off even
for a brief
[Applause]
second we're live on
[Applause]
eatv and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be a and trolling
my name is Derek Ray and sitting
alongside me in the commentary position
is the former Arsenal and West Ham
Midfield player Stuart Robson and
delighted to be bringing you club's
match action how's it going to go Stuart
thanks Derek well often we talk about
the tactics the individual players
players that are missing but so often
it's the mentality of the players that
is key to winning any football game
which of these teams has the right
attitude today is the big
question Antonio
everra the attack looks
[Applause]
promising a wonderful
intervention and a throw in it's going
to
be so deflection and it will be a throw
[Applause]
in and the flag has gone up here offside
the
decision Endo with
[Applause]
it well they couldn't keep possession
oh lovely
ball and firing it towards goal on the
volley could have gone in well that's a
big chance yes it's on the volley but I
think he should score
there
aalai end with
[Applause]
it and now
borut and there the move ends for
now and the referee allowing the game to
flow using
Advantage
Anthony verovski
and credit due a good
intervention getting
forward really good attacking
play well I think we were expecting a
much better effort from there he has to
score really that was a great
[Applause]
opportunity
and that's very good refereeing to let
the play
Flow well that takes the wind out of
their sails great
[Applause]
defending and that's great work to make
sure it didn't go over the
line well it's all about passing as they
try to hit the front
a creative look about this but the
danger averted for
now
Antonio just unable to get his cross
beyond the first
Defender an opportunity to forge ahead
from this corner situation
[Applause]
now sending it in aerial opportunity
couldn't take it well he did well to get
to the ball first and he's unlucky there
he just got too much on
it
Enzo and losing
[Applause]
possession
[Applause]
not a poor touch and unable to keep it
in play throw in to
[Applause]
come a chance maybe from the wide
position well didn't go as a plan on the
end
Antonio well this looks really
productive what can they do from this
position a goal to give them a one n
lead an excellent value for that
Advantage you've got to
[Applause]
say and now
borut
alalay
borut
well read to put an end to that
attack he has teammates around
him determined defending wilting under
the pressure and now they try to go
forward options in the middle makes his
way in
field has a go and the goalkeeper has
outdone himself with that
save can he deliver it with
accuracy good piece of
[Applause]
Defending
opportunity oh keeper dealt with
it well can they draw level here the
crowd certainly think
so trying to pick out a teammate oh
commanding
goalkeeping a corner right on the back
of the last
one oh that's not a good
clearance
and the whistle is sounded for halime in
this
[Applause]
game
move let
see so back underway and an intriguing
second half in
[Applause]
[Applause]
Prospect he could pick out a teammate
and playing it back ball is loose oh oh
and he puts away the second chance
goalkeeper
error well here's the replay yes it's a
decent shot but the goalkeeper has to do
a lot better there he's pared it out
into a dangerous area and suddenly the
ball's in the back of his net it's poor
goalkeeping you have to
say a foul but Advantage played now the
advantage wasn't helping them and so now
they get the free
kick
he'll try his luck here and the keeper
grabbing hold of that free
kick opportunity to deliver the
cross so a throw in
here
well after pressing like that maybe the
short route to
goal denied by the bar back in play here
and well positioned to
clear well they just can't get back into
this game the woodwork on that occasion
just denying them and foul it is
[Applause]
then
[Applause]
firing it towards goal and saved by The
[Applause]
Keeper he's driven in the corner but he
made catch Under Pressure reminder
tickets for the next game are available
for S after today's
game
Antonio barzowski
[Applause]
Antonio well these fans are demanding
much more here they have to start
winning the ball back quicker at the
moment they're too easy to play against
well let's see what they have in store
for for them on the
break promising pass well they couldn't
quite use that break in the manner that
they'd
[Applause]
hoped
antoan they've regained possession
that's a good looking
ball the referee allowing the play to
flow and a chance whip it in here really
important piece of last ditch defending
oh he looks
threatening well in there to tidy
up and the referee blows for a
[Applause]
[Applause]
foul Enzo
borut and now
borut possession
lost released it nicely well there was
impending danger but good
[Applause]
defending just 20 minutes remaining
now M to win it
back well the Defenders know they need
to get tighter can't really allow runs
like that and he did well to cut it
out over the touch line for a throw
in
vut
well couldn't keep it that's a good
ball
alalay good waight on that
pass and options in the center
insufficient guile on the crossing front
you've got to
say
here's
Yang
Antonio oh stylish ball what can they do
now superbly read and
executed
Alves
[Applause]
might really be able to trouble them
here that's a nice looking ball well
pretty straightforward for the keeper
you've got to
say
Evra Anan that's a good looking
ball another successful intervention
winning the ball
back
5 minutes
left well it was a foul but good use of
Advantage by the
referee and tidy defensive
play and now borut and the advantage
acrs to the attacking side and both
hands on it good
goalkeeping Endo with with
it well they've given him too much space
l of the Box well not away
properly we've had the official word
there will be a minimum of two added
minutes not to like about that
pass excellent strike well it's ended up
being easier for the goalkeeper in the
end and so the referee blows for full
time and it goes down and has a victory
for the visitors well Derek they were
dominant in most aspects of the game
particularly in that Midfield area and
they also look threatening in the top
third of the pitch it's a really good
result for
[Applause]
[Applause]
them
for
I
that's
this is it a can't miss game and a
backdrop to match what is a special
occasion the fans had this one circled
on their calendars long ago and now it's
a matter of who will dominate on the
pitch top players big characters on the
big stage a highly exciting prospect
it's live next on EA
[Applause]
[Music]
TV one of the great things about
football is that no one knows for sure
what's going to happen let's see what
unfolds here tonight I'm Derek Ray on
the commentary Gantry and delighted to
be joined as always by Stuart Robson and
delighted to be bringing you club's
match action Stuart tell us about your
pre-match thoughts thanks Derek well
both managers will be reminding their
players of starting the game quickly
pinning the opposition back playing the
ball forward and regaining possession as
quickly as possible hopefully we get a
really good game
[Applause]
here now big trouble finding space on
the
flank and credit is due for that good
piece of Defending
[Applause]
will he play it
in but he knows what he's doing
defensively and it was turned out so a
throw in will be
next
Gale working so hard to win back
possession
and Arnold has
it
Gale and foul it is
then oh he's lost possession of the ball
shooting
chance goalkeeper getting in the way
superb save cross fired over just wanted
to get it out of
[Applause]
there could be
[Applause]
dangerous not out of the woods
yet and it took a little Nick before it
went over the touch line so a throw in
[Applause]
here defensive Brazilians to shut them
down and they could face difficulties
here he'll be delighted to have won the
ball having made that difficult
challenge
antoan really fine piece of Defending
play to break us
up well it clearly was deflected so it
will be their throw
in an example of how to
[Applause]
press doing well to win it back what can
they do from here could still be
dangerous
[Applause]
well no damage
done oh yes what a pass just needs to
steady himself he had to score and he
does well we can see it again now and it
all starts with the pass over the top it
takes out so many Defenders and then
he's so calm with a finish call as you
like to round the keeper and he's slots
it away so nicely it's a really good
goal jenu
Ford
Gale well a classic example of how to
intercept
[Applause]
anthonyy well possibilities Inside the
Box just letting it run over the by line
and a corner here
trying to pick out a teammate struggling
to get it away and thating his opponent
in the nick of
time and unable to keep
possession effective
press but he certainly not alone chance
for the leveler safe pair ofans did his
job well the danger was on but just a
fraction
offside
Anthony emphasis on the clearance a good
one decent looking
pass now high quality
defending now maybe room here for the
Counterattack and quick thinking
[Applause]
defensively still trying to make
something
[Applause]
happen J well he has the measure of his
man releas it
[Applause]
nicely
antoan and options in the
[Applause]
center they won't complain about but
having won the corner and maybe an
opportunity to increase their
advantage and couldn't quite keep the
header down well he's attacked it well
made decent contact but he couldn't keep
it down enough could
he really clever
[Applause]
pressing
Arnold
[Applause]
so one minute of stoppage time that's
what the officials have said no letup
here oh this looks useful well somehow
the goalkeeper got to
it let's see about the delivery no
shortage of excitement level again no
wonder they're
excited big trouble and so the halftime
whistle is gone here at the p in
[Applause]
Paris
get
into the second half here at the
parte and big trouble could get in
behind the
defense and cuts inside well it didn't
happen for them in
attack
[Applause]
Anthony oh nice ball over the top to
chase now he's got to stay calm and a
goal in the lead again fully
deserved well as you can see here it all
starts with a perfectly weighted ball in
behind the Defenders and then what a
finish that's been hit with such power
and Pace the keeper has no time to react
it's a brilliant
strike
Chang
jenu
Ford and they have possession
again
Evra and he has options available
and it's gone over the
[Applause]
line interception to Snuff out the
[Applause]
danger and big trouble might be able to
to profit here that's a useful cross and
a goal an end to endend game and they
weren't behind for
[Applause]
long so underway again and it's a story
of par two goals a piece in this
one nice looking
pass could play it
in he fancies it and that a piece of
goalkeeping you're going to see again
and again and
[Applause]
again and there's the delivery and the
danger still
on it's there for him oh such an elegant
finish how about that on the volley a
brilliant strike whatever way you look
at
it you can't really say defenses are on
top
[Applause]
32 it needs an accurate cross well
capable of a better clearance than
that on a time for composure on the
ball
Arnold that's a good looking ball untiy
on the
[Applause]
ball and the ruling is offside
[Applause]
here and that's an important
intervention but he's certainly not
alone
[Applause]
good ball over the
top good looking
sequence it was on its way
in it has gone over the touch line for
what'll be a throw
in defensive Brazilians to shut them
down
reading it
well gets in the way once
[Applause]
more just failing to hit the target with
this pass and it'll be a throw
in
oh beating his opponent with
ease but no damage done that's the main
thing and the Counterattack is on
options
available well that break looked so
promising but nothing coming from
it
jenu really well played
pass and it cross the touch line so a
throw in here
not Advantage with them referee says
play
on and support
available well full marks for getting
past him but a good piece of tidying
up difficult to stop him can he finish
the off he's done it what a climax to
this
[Applause]
game so the current score line
42
Anan good through ball well they had a
decent reading of that ball
[Applause]
in
and what can they do to stop him running
at them but quick thinking
defensively nice waight on the pass and
the referee blows for a
[Applause]
foul
teammates in the
middle penalty in the opinion of the
referee and this is seriously getting
away from
them well some might say he's been for
in it goes a well taken
[Applause]
penalty
well if there were any lingering doubts
about the outcome surely they now have
been
removed
[Applause]
Aina
Onan well making considerable progress
with the
ball
an alert piece of
Defending over the touch line for a
throw
[Applause]
in jenu good Vision can he get onto this
well he's been ruled to have taken up an
illegal position only just however
Stuart well he loves running off the
back of Defenders but on with tackling
like that the onus is on the referee to
take action
potentially oh marvelous save great
goalkeeping and there goes the final
whistle much to the disappointment of
their supporters Will D that just wasn't
good enough
today
know
follow
me
heading for a showdown two teams who
thrive on pressure and performing on the
big occasion now they get their wish
fans the world world over are fully
focused on this atmospheric Stadium
where the drama is about to be played
out over the next 90 intriguing minutes
who will
prevail we're live on
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
eatv good evening and welcome ahead of
what should be a pulsating night of
football my name's Derek Ray and
delighted to have along inside me as
usual on these occasions Stuart Robson
and it's going to be fascinating to see
how these two sides fare as they come up
against each other Stuart what are you
expecting well thanks Derek the best
coach I played under would always tell
us before kickoff earn the right to play
if you can win your individual battles
outrun your opponent eventually you'll
get the space to show your ability I'm
sure that's being echoed by the coaches
here
today moving the ball forward how
creative can they be textbook defending
Inside the
Box they do like to press whenever they
[Applause]
can and the referee Blows the Whistle it
is a free
kick
Fon
oh
Aguero
[Applause]
oh that's a really good
run an inability to keep hold of the
ball
[Applause]
there physically strong and secure on
the
ball
[Applause]
Antonio opportunity great
[Applause]
defending and there's the delivery No
Nonsense piece of
Defending like to run with the ball at
his feet could be not a very complicated
catch for the
[Applause]
keeper oh diing with a bit of danger
here and foul it is
then
[Applause]
Aguero and credit due a good
intervention plenty of
options can he play it
in and keeping it out
[Applause]
possession given away
unfortunately chance to put them in
front making sure nothing on toward
happened superb
[Applause]
tackle element of risk there but he's
won the ball
[Applause]
levandowski
[Applause]
Antonio possession lost by the black
cats delivered into the box thumps
clear
really good buildup but no end
[Applause]
product can he put them in front but it
was a wonderful chance but the
goalkeeper comes through yes Derek we
have to give credit to the keeper but
surely he should have scored there
that's a big big
chance can he deliver it with accuracy
goalkeeper doing his job getting the
touch Corner once
[Applause]
more ranking at
PACE well unable to bend his run
offside
well the visitors have had most of the
ball in the last 15 minutes and created
a hack full of chances but when you're
enjoying that amount of possession you
need to make it
count and coly done in the
end
Aguero there's a win it
[Applause]
back
he continues his
[Applause]
run danger reverted for
now not an opportunity here for them to
get their noses in front from the corner
well just listen to these fans they're
urging their team to score here and take
the
[Applause]
lead the pressure was high and they
could be in here and it goes the goal
for one n and that changes the
[Applause]
dynamic One n
[Applause]
then oh that's a super piece of
Defending
diabi not Advantage with them referee
says play
on well that's how to outwit your
opponent oh tremendous goalkeeping
offside not that anyone
[Applause]
knew
well that's going to be all for the
first half more football to
[Applause]
come
so the two teams have switched around
and the second half is
underway
[Applause]
superb defensive judgment to end the
attack and yang has
it well they continue their push for The
Equalizer but definitely not forcing it
well they were very patient but they no
longer have the
ball
can they keep it
out and the verdict of the referee is
penalty she's pointed to the spot now
can they Square the
game well it had to be a penalty and a
booking part of the story as
well chance to equalize here a goal
calmly taken spot
[Applause]
kick so underway again here on the back
of that leveler and a good looking
ball oh really good header really fine
goalkeeping and the corner has been
given who can he pick out well capable
of a better clearance than
that well that's a sad end to the
attack
Antonio in a position from which they
could potentially do a bit of damage
[Applause]
here this is looking threatening but it
Fizzles out thanks to that piece of
Defending Crossing
possibilities oh fine
[Applause]
stop can he deliver it with accuracy the
crossbar got in the
way and a goal this time applying the
Finishing Touch just what the doctor
ordered
well just look at this he's so bright in
the Box he's first to the ball and then
a decent finish it's a good bit of play
Distributing it
well good looking
sequence just cutting off the
supply and into the last 30 minutes
now
Antonio
everra incisive
pass marvelous
anticipation
oh Advantage
played showing good defensive
judgment
[Applause]
Antonio
Onan well that'll be a free
[Applause]
kick real
chance can they cover
[Applause]
up ball with
diabi
oh 20 minutes to
go and moving the ball
nicely
[Applause]
attacking possibilities for the black
cats that's a useful cross well on the
final analysis not quite precise enough
goal kick
[Applause]
here
[Applause]
Antonio good distribution
it's the Black Cat's turn
now that's a good pass a matter of
keeping his composure oh goodness me he
made it far too easy for the keeper
didn't
he oh fine play and maybe it'll set
something up he can't hold on to
it it was an attack of promise but they
couldn't take advantage of the
situation well there was the chance for
The Equalizer but you have to say say
what a great save that
[Applause]
was he could pick out a
teammate he'll be breathing a sigh of
relief ball
one the conditions look pretty good for
the
Counterattack well no time to waste can
they find an
equalizer and the danger is
averted
the switch of play now good weight on
that
pass great opportunity oh a vital piece
of last ditch
[Applause]
defending excellent assessment of the
situation at the
[Applause]
back well that's a super ball over the
top offside the
[Applause]
decision
fogden disappointing for the black cats
to give it away in that
fashion and we will have a couple of
additional minutes at the end
here
might be able to get in behind the
defense well that's good defending well
organized at the
back and play halted free kick
given but he could run onto it
here took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
[Applause]
them and so the referee blows for full
time and it goes down as a victory
for the chances and just about deserve
their
win
top players on a fitting stage that's
what we're talking about a match of
colossal importance and one that has
captured the imagination of anyone with
an interest in this great game of
football now we're truly ready for what
will be a
[Applause]
showdown stay with us here on EA TV

should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be olling I'm Derek
at the microphone and joining me for
match commentary is Stuart Robson and
delighted to be bringing you club's
match action what do you anticipate
seeing Stewart well Derek we can talk
about coaches and their methods but it's
now down to the players which ones are
going to stand out who will affect the
game and who will have the greater
desire it should be a cracking game
though
riberi oh what a topn
pass
[Applause]
Antonio
Antonio
well good run this now what can he do
with it but nothing comes of it good
defending it
[Applause]
was it's with
Amar was an ambitious pass didn't quite
execute it
properly Swift ball into the area he
knows he's got to
react now can he get on the end of this
[Applause]
one all the way through to the keeper
then
Evra
Anthony
and the ball in behind the
Defenders and the referee has pointed to
the spot a penalty it is and a chance
for them to forge ahead and to add
insult to injury it's a and he slots at
home with
confidence and back underway one nil it
is
[Applause]
seamons well the referee wasn't going to
let that
[Applause]
go and played in oh it comes to nothing
in the end really should have made more
of
[Applause]
that
evera definitely look as though they
want to make this move
count oh managing to beat him lovely
ball over the top oh blocked
it
[Applause]
corner kick played in well it's a moment
he would like to have back if
[Applause]
possible it's with
[Applause]
AAR
not getting anxious when they have the
ball and in the right position to make
sure it didn't go all the way
through and scope for them to produce
something
exciting and offside it
is really good ball
[Applause]
there and defense of play to be
[Applause]
applauded
Anthony and the decision offside
here
seamons
Vernon oh he's given the ball
away they might be able to get in
[Applause]
now really fine piece of Defending play
to break us
up
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
room to roam for the
foxes and foiled only by the
crossbar well threat over for now
opportunity to deliver the cross must be
and he's done it par again a magnificent
game
unfolding
so back underway they've leveled it at
1-1 here
Anan and yang has
it Evra what a brilliant
[Applause]
pass clears it away
and a good challenge to bring that
attack to an
[Applause]
end nicely cut
[Applause]
out not a huge chunk of added time one
minute
really important
tackle and there it is the halftime
whistle time is up as far as the
[Applause]
first
[Music]
well as they get the ball rolling again
interesting to see see how this second
half pans
[Applause]
out determin
defending can he put them in front and
there it is but hang on the flag has
gone up and it's not going to count well
it was a close call but he is just
offside good finish mind
you good ball to switch the play good
waight on that pass the ball back with
the foxers
now
[Applause]
mialik
antoan
Onan well read to ease the
[Applause]
pressure
Anan
everra showing good defensive judgment
and support
available and let's give credit to the
[Applause]
defending he continues his
run to jump and front and the keeper
taking care of the
situation well there you have it they
haven't been good enough going forward
they've created very little so far they
need to play with much more
urgency
mik good through ball and that'll be
offside and the pass was just that
little bit off nearly found its
Target possession lost by the
foxes
[Applause]
Antonio
perfect
tackle and making the move to the inside
well far too much on that particular
[Applause]
cross really good buildup but no end
product
antoan this could be
Troublesome such an important
goalkeeping intervention under
[Applause]
pressure and the flag does go up
[Applause]
offside now in a more than decent
[Applause]
position plenty of supports here oh that
Splendid
play smuggled
away and the conditions look pretty good
for the
Counterattack well it came to nothing in
the
end
Onan
being egged on by the crowd well the
goalkeeper making a big contribution and
denying him another one well it's
another chance for him as you said he
looks so hungry for goals
today and a good looking ball oh that's
not a good
clearance nice waight on the pass and in
oh yes exactly what they were hoping to
produce they've delivered the
goal
well a dramatic moment near the end and
that might well be the
decider decent looking
pass superbly read and
executed and a useful
cross aware of a threat solving the
problem
EMP
[Applause]
lovely ball over the
top oh right in the nick of
[Applause]
time that's a good
[Applause]
ball
Onan able to deal with the the threat a
corner then and with time running out
they've got to ask
questions delivering it well he didn't
miss by a huge margin did
[Applause]
he pressing like that will help the
cause this could Square the game but no
thank to the goalkeeper opportunity not
taken well you're absolutely right Derek
the Keeper's done really well there but
really that should have been The
Equalizer and there's not long left
now who can he pick out not did his job
defensively now maybe room here for the
Counterattack and he's in and he's made
it a brace for himself The Defenders
just unable to stay with him and he's
having a field
day
antoan leading it
through he had a bit of work to do and
getting to that through ball the
[Applause]
goalkeeper
mialik it is to be a throw
[Music]
in and just losing control of the ball
and it will be a Thro
[Applause]
in
[Applause]
we will have a couple of additional
minutes at the end here well breaking at
PACE is always a
[Applause]
possibility chance to finish oh how on
Earth has he missed that what a glorious
opportunity well the flag's gone up and
he was offside but he didn't know that
when he took his shot and that is the
end of the contest and not the happy
outcome as as
far and they didn't deserve anything
from the game need a much better display
next time
out
h
A fitting backdrop but a match of
massive significance the stage is set a
packed house at the ready awaiting two
teams who like nothing better than to
test themselves on a stage like this the
tricky part is trying to decide which
side will out Fox the
other complete coverage on the way with
eatv
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be enrolling I'm Derek
Ray and joining me to provide experts
analysis is Stuart Robson and on the
menu today club's match action for you
to enjoy how do you see the match going
Stuart thanks Derek as always this
should be a good game great atmosphere
inside the stadium we've got two teams
full of quality some interesting
matchups and two coaches that want to
play an attractive brand of football
what more could you ask
for but he took care of it
defensively good use of Advantage
promising
pass really showing off as wide range of
passing
skills Onan and possession lost
there
Malini and a throw in Forth
coming well that's a completely wasted
throw
in now with
Balotelli
batell lovely ball over the top well I
must say it did look so promising but
the flag is raised offside the verdict
Stewart well he's just too eager there
it's the right run but he's made it too
early well they're on the scent of
something
positive and tremendous individual
skill
but no damage done that's the main
[Applause]
thing well he tried in vain to get
himself back on side well he needs to
show greater awareness there and hold on
to the ball a fraction
[Applause]
longer
and giving it
[Applause]
away
antoan he has teammates around
him but the vendor doing his
job well it looked highly promising but
they got nothing out of it
that's what you call defending from the
front possibilities here it's got to be
and the keeper there to deal with it
well the cross didn't get past the first
Defender and a useful
[Applause]
cross TT Bo closing down and now they're
on the
attack it could be up for
grabs and cleared behind for what is
going to be a corner
[Music]
[Applause]
kick now sending it in and there it is
the Breakthrough that will do
nicely
are back underway and one n it is let's
see what happens
[Applause]
next
everra
antoan in the right place to cut out the
pass
[Applause]
Malini
herio plenty of forward momentum here
but can they
produce onto
baratelli Kim well that ball looks
promising
[Applause]
it needs an accurate
cross well no pressure on the keeper po
cross
Aina
[Music]
Anan and yang has
it interception to Snuff out the danger
[Applause]
the textbook
[Applause]
interception still looking to get the
shot off oh that surely had to go in but
marvelous defending well they've won
themselves a corner and a chance perhaps
to add an additional goal for
security can someone get on the end of
this and he did what he had to do
[Applause]
defensively passes like that very much
in his
well trailing but this looks
promising but he knew he had to get to
the ball and he
did there will be one minute added on at
the
end free kick awarded then by the
referee and that is that for the first
half here in the French
capital
into the second half here at the park de
br
it did look on for them but not to
be and a lot to like about this attack a
fine reading of the
[Applause]
situation he could pick out a teammate
and the keeper deals with the danger and
a confident
[Applause]
clearance
Antonio oh what an
opportunity well there was impending
danger but good defending corner kick
pick awarded and let's see if this will
help them add to their
lead who can they pick out can still be
dangerous decent cross but nobody in the
vicinity using all his defensive Acumen
to cut it
out and yang has
it
good waight on that pass and possession
changing
[Applause]
hands and yang has
it
[Applause]
Anthony
Evra intercepting it
intelligently could be a chance to break
here it should
be well he failed to get it away
properly they've lost
it
Miss
a foul but Advantage
played he has teammates around
him oh good defending to stop a decent
looking
attack now can they counter
clinically really annoying for them
couldn't take
advantage
Splendid defending and it needed to be
safe Pair of Hands did his
[Applause]
job managed to get it out of
there and into the last 20
minutes and space for them here on the
flank
still a
chance I think he'll be kicking himself
ruled offside well his Instinct should
have told him he was offside there he
has to be more alert in the
Box well read to win possession
[Applause]
back now with
Maldini
Neville nicely cut
out just 15 minutes
remaining here's
Yang now he must favor the cross well
there's defensive solidity for
you
danger here as he runs at them he can't
hold on to
it well having been awarded the corner
they'll no doubt look to put the issue
beyond all
[Applause]
doubt playing it
in and the danger is
[Applause]
averted
and yang has it well still pushing
forward it's a matter of whether or not
they can come up with an
equalizer that's very effective good
high
[Applause]
pressing heril Crossing possibilities
well making contact with the ball but
couldn't quite keep his header
[Applause]
out
[Music]
Antonio
everra just failing to hit the target
with this pass and it'll be a throwi
in he could pick out a
teammate clear to see who got the last
touch so a throwi in it'll
be
and the flag has gone up well he has to
work a lot harder to stay on side there
he didn't read the situation at
all
Özil and back now with
Cristiano and looking towards the back
post oh off the woodwork and behind for
a goal kick well he just couldn't get
above it could he but that was a good
effort
Anthony and that is the end of the game
it goes into the
[Applause]
history
we
I
the Camas are fixed to one man well
Derek we know he can score goals in many
different ways but I think he's at his
most dangerous when he's running with
the ball and hitting his shots with
power it's almost Unstoppable for the
goalkeeper that's what makes him a great
[Music]
finisher we're live on on EA
TV one of the great things about
football is that no one knows for sure
what's going to happen let's see what
unfolds here tonight I'm Derek Ray on
the commentary Gantry and delighted to
be joined as always by Stuart Robson and
it's going to be fascinating to see how
these two sides fare as they come up
against each other
what do you anticipate seeing Stuart
well Derek we can talk about coaches and
their methods but it's now down to the
players which ones are going to stand
out who will affect the game and who
will have the greater desire it should
be a cracking game
though well just over cook that one and
she couldn't keep us in
play in a decent position
now oh a brilliantly timed tackle when
it really mattered and and over the by
line goal kick coming
up and a simple clearance a good
one takes the shot and a goal it is no
long wait for the opener
[Applause]
today and the timing was perfect ball
one and Under Pressure that was a fine
[Applause]
claim oh he's lost possession of the
[Applause]
ball well they did have the ball but not
anymore
Conte
[Applause]
Aguero
Anthony
Onan nice looking
pass and cleared
[Applause]
away delivering it not the most
confident
clearance danger reverted for
[Applause]
now opportunity in the wide area not a
bit of an unforced error and it's going
to be a
[Applause]
throw using all his defensive Acumen to
cut it out
[Applause]
and quick thinking
defensively that's very good refereeing
to let the play
Flow throw in
given couldn't hang on to the
ball to really get at the opposition
here it's an
opportunity the cut
[Applause]
back excellent
[Applause]
defending onto Yang might be a chance
here
here and that a piece of goalkeeping
you're going to see again and again and
[Applause]
again and over it comes found wanting a
bit with that
delivery well they've won themselves a
corner and a chance perhaps to add an
additional goal for
security and nothing in comes of this
attack pretty comfortable piece of
Defending could be
dangerous opportunity and a goal it was
served up on a silver platter for
him well here's the replay and it's a
simple finish in the end but where was
the defending that's just not good
enough lot to like about that
pass good looking cross and he's clear
as
[Applause]
lines that's very effective good high
pressing now counterattacking
possibilities
here can they make it
count cross
blocked
an effective
challenge Running Room in the wide
position there's the cut back oh danger
here could be and a goal it is to put
them in front again no less than they
deserve
Onan good Vision can he get onto
this
it is to be a throw
in well the stats show us that the hosts
haven't had that much of the ball but
when they have won it back in Midfield
areas their counterattacking has been
excellent they'll be happy with the way
the game's going at the moment yes
really good without the ball and the
allaround performance levels have been
[Applause]
high moving the ball forward with
purpose but quick thinking
[Applause]
defensively and fling his opponent in
the nick of time oh it's in a two goal
cushion now and the lead fully
[Applause]
merited onto
Yang so nearing the break here and it's
not going to plan at all for the
visitors we have to to be honest Stuart
your thoughts well they can certainly
play better than this it's been a
disappointing first half display from
them but if they can just play with more
urgency and energy in the second half
they can get back into this they
definitely have the
[Applause]
quality well clattered
away
and so the first half story has been
written
it's
[Applause]
so the two teams have switched around
and the second half is
[Applause]
underway oh lovely ball and he could
cash
in well it looked so promising but a
goal kicked the
outcome really clever
[Applause]
pressing Antonio
here Honan can they take
advantage a good and fair
Challenge and the conditions look pretty
good for the
Counterattack well they profit from this
situation able to get his body in the
way and he did well to cut it
out oh could be
and in oh yes exactly what they were
hoping to produce they've delivered the
[Applause]
goal
Aguero he fanes it and he's outdone
himself wonderful save
[Applause]
there
trying to pick out a
teammate counterattacking
chance and finally upper
CAC Under
Pressure it's with
Romero on the ball vaka could be
[Applause]
dangerous an alert piece of
Defending might really be able to
trouble them
here well what a stop it was well I have
to say that's a magnificent save that's
a top class piece of
[Applause]
goalkeeping and there's the
delivery and well positioned to
[Applause]
clear
that's a good looking ball and you need
your Defender to take
charge plenty of support
[Applause]
here the pressure is on can he clear it
away fine tackle there to prevent the
chance
[Applause]
now breaking at PACE potential
danger wilting under the pressure and
now they try to go
forward oh
surely tremendous defending to Stone
Wall
him
we've had a pair of car keys handed in
Romo with it a of car keys and a wallet
if those are your items please collect
after the game thank
you 20 minutes to go in this
[Applause]
one Romero now well full marks for
getting past
him
really good ball there but it comes to
nothing in the end offside well he
doesn't need to make his movement quite
so quickly there just let the ball be
played into the
space well did well to win the ball
back over the touch line for a throw
[Applause]
in
well shown
[Applause]
[Music]
inside now the quick Counterattack could
be
on but nothing comes of it good
defending it
was
Antonio still could be dang dous and a
goal well it looks easy when you can put
them away like
that well here's the replay and this is
what you're always told as a kid go for
the far post make it difficult for the
keeper and then hope your teammate is
ready for any rebound he does exactly
that and they get their reward what a
good goal that
was now we're inside the final 10
minutes in this
one
strong but fair
[Applause]
tackle
Conte well this game is almost in the
history books and it's not going to be
one the visitors will want to remember
for long Stewart well they've been
second best that's for sure and the main
problem has been in Midfield where
they've been overrun at times they just
haven't been able to get enough
possession it's not been a good
performance today
chance to
[Applause]
cross committed
challenge
I couldn't quite find his
teammate not a huge chunk of out of time
one
minute and the danger
cleared and that is going to be that
well a tale
of need to refocus now and perform
better next time
out
your
hello
