all
they fought long and hard and now it
comes down to this the equation is
simple win the game and win promotion
can they do it with the pressure
on
it's coming up
[Applause]
live one of the great things about
football is that no one knows for sure
what's going to happen let's see what
unfolds here tonight my name is Derek
Ray and ready with his tactics board to
provide all the analysis is Stuart
Robson and if everything falls into
place for them today we'll be talking
about a promotion party Stuart tell us
about your pre-match thoughts well what
a great opportunity for them here a win
today and they will be promoted this
really should be an exciting game I'm
looking forward to this
one and it's with
Lopez and back with Kelly
now oh lovely weighted ball they might
be
[Applause]
in
good technique displayed he succeeded in
getting his fist to
[Applause]
it
pool
Johan antoan
high quality
defending released at
nicely brilliant team pressing chances
on and the keeper able to hold on to
[Applause]
it
[Applause]
well there's an example of how to press
high
up putting in quite the shift to win the
ball
[Applause]
back plenty of supports here well he hit
it with Authority close
[Music]
[Applause]
Yamada nice looking pass that's how to
rob them of
possession pool
Onan and trouble is brewing and a goal
that will do it they've been pushing for
it and now they've been
rewarded
[Applause]
Johan
pyol
[Applause]
Top Class
[Applause]
defending and Cristiano has it now
promising looking
attack who can he pick
out well passing moves like this will
build
confidence and a passing sequence that's
easy on the eye but then the
commentator's curse comes into
play can he get them level they just
couldn't stay in front and now this
match is all
[Applause]
square so underway again here on the
back of that
leveler and Kelly with it
[Applause]
it has gone over the touch line for
what'll be a throw
in they did have the ball but not
anymore crucial interception amid
impending
danger and both hands on it good
goalkeeping
and offside
[Applause]
here
Antonio and a chance to whip it in
here and there it breaks down but credit
to the
defense
[Applause]
a chance to nudge in front corner kick
here and there's the
delivery Clear
[Applause]
away
Johan well he could really get at the
opposition and let's give credit to the
defending and it's with
Lopez just lost his Focus throw in here
not the pass he had in mind and they
will be awarded a free kick for
[Applause]
that and unable to keep
[Applause]
possession Antonio
and players waiting in the center and a
tidy
challenge not a huge chunk of outed Time
1
minute well there was a really stylish
piece of
[Applause]
running and there it is the half halime
whistle
[Applause]
[Applause]
it's not the
best
well as they get the ball rolling again
interesting to see how this second half
pans
out using all his defensive Acumen to
cut it out
well she's certainly not alone and
players waiting at the far post oh that
goes down as a wonderful save but hang
on offside is the decision
[Applause]
here a really good pass Crossing into
the
[Applause]
middle oh danger
here book defending Inside the
[Applause]
Box can he put them in front oh great
defending a decisive clearance it
[Applause]
was
pyol and moving the ball
nicely but then the commentator's curse
comes into
play and Cristiano has it now and the
counter looks on here options
available has eyes for goal and nearly
the perfect break but no end product
well it's just off Target but what a
good Counterattack that
was good example of pressing without the
ball rainy deserves credit for winning
the ball
back 30 minutes to go
then well nothing to split the two sides
but this move looks Pro missing and the
referee takes exception to the Challenge
free
kick well you saw what he was trying
with that free kick but the goalkeeper
had it covered all the way well they've
been frustrated for quite a while now
but these fans have suddenly come to
life tell the corner played into the box
oh Super Header but the goalkeeper was
up to the
task averted for now but it'll be
another
just the clearance that was
needed
Yamada
a very effective challenge put
in he's enjoying
space but really sticking to their task
[Applause]
defensively and the referee spotted the
foul but has played
Advantage well the hosts have completely
bossed the game in the last 15 minutes
and have looked great going forward just
need to take one of the chances they've
created to get themselves ahead
[Applause]
today
Aina Jo obstru the main entrance remove
the car as soon as possible thank you
pyol can they trouble the opposition
this time putting them under the C and a
decent save for
[Applause]
credit and he's fired over the corner no
trouble at all as far as the keeper was
concerned
a quarter of an hour remaining
here well showing good
vision and take it
away promising
pass and a fine cross and an effec of
clearance
perfect
challenge nice looking pass trying to
get onto the front foot with the minutes
ticking away and giving it real leather
but off the crossbar here well he struck
it with power but he's got to keep that
down
Antonio
P oh what a topnotch
pass determined defending well this
forthcoming Corner might just do it
could be their last chance to hit the
front in the dying moments oh last ditch
defending at its very
finest trying to open the
[Applause]
mark beeding it through they were
playing fluent football but then the
foul and now you would anticipate a
yellow
[Applause]
[Applause]
card well the free kick just over the
crossbar well I have to say I thought
that was going in but as you said Derek
just just over the crossbar not quite
coming down in
time
Aina
Antonio level pegging but can they
change
that and no nonsense defensive
clearance
well a bit more in the way of precision
was
[Applause]
required
[Applause]
Doyle
Yamada fine cross into the middle oh
that's a fine
save and now a corner can they take
advantage of
it
and the referee brings this contest to
an end it certainly was pulsating it had
us on
[Applause]
the
[Applause]
[Applause]
the
last
I
a crucial day stands in front of them
the knowledge that a win is required to
make it through to the promotion match
