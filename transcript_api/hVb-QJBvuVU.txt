Cardona F irin
[Applause]
Cardona well they couldn't keep
possession
icardi chance to put them in front oh
really commanding
goalkeeping and the corner has been
given and now the deliver delivery
thumps
clear
Pogba good defending to prevent the
[Applause]
chance Roman
pero can they take
advantage a foul but Advantage
[Applause]
played
well not the pass he had in
mind and Neymar oh big chance he had
just the goalkeeper to beat he's got it
completely wrongly well he won't be
watching that when he gets home tonight
on a
replay Kim
MJ
[Applause]
icardi Maro icardi
here it has gone over the touch
line for what'll be a throw in
[Applause]
icardi Paul
Pogba
verti oh good hit close
[Applause]
shame Simon
Missi and that was a very fine
[Music]
read he's allowed his opponent to get
past him can they take the lead but he
did his job
defensively still
alive well no damage
done well I can't believe it's still
Level what save that was from the
keeper well they'll be happy to have
regained possession
good bit of
pressing Maro icardi
here now
Neymar alert
[Applause]
defending bliat well let's see what they
have in store for them on the
break less than convincing defending
the opening goal but on the balance of
play who would have expected this well
how have they done that they don't
deserve it but they'll take it
wor the opening goal of the game
[Applause]
then since they have the ball the
referee playing Advantage
here as you can see the visitors don't
have too much of the ball oh maybe The
Equalizer they just stay in front and
now this match is all
[Applause]
square well the earlier goal canceled
out one a
piece
[Applause]
k
du and Pogba taking charge
[Applause]
defensively defensive resilience to shut
them
down well they've won possession back
what can they do from
here
e well he didn't miss by an awful
[Applause]
lot
verati and now passing it
through will it
be and a goal in the lead again fully
deserved
[Applause]
well PSG get the ball moving again how
will they
respond
aardi
mbapp PSG looking oh what an
opportunity it's open up for him oh he's
missed it Lee still plenty of time to go
Derek but they won't get a better chance
than
that
[Applause]
the pass by mbappe he'll be
disappointed so one minute of stoppage
time that's what the officials have
said Dimitri
Leonard well he's hit it with far too
much height well he's quite a long way
out and if you put Power on the ball and
just lean back
the teams are ready to have a go at each
other again as the second half
commences
icardi intercepting it
intelligently really closing him down
here iard oh did so well to deny him
the referee has given a
corner and firing it into the area well
as a Defender that will suit you down to
the
ground
simonei this might be ideal for the
counter a league that always seems to
produce fine young players League a an
action coming up on eatv it's Paris San
up against Le yeah I'm predicting a
cracker there both teams will have a
real go at each other I'm
sure tremendous ball played
through must be and it's a goal for p
San to square this
game well another equalizer what a topsy
tury game this has
[Applause]
been
Leon he's going to be disappointed with
that
pass he's got the right idea with that
pass the pass in behind the defense
quick thinking from The
[Music]
Keeper honora opportunity in the wide
area Simoni
[Applause]
Veri and that'll be
offside substitution time it
is
munier and very deafly cut
out
simonei plenty of forward momentum here
but can they
produce shy now the keeper grabs
[Applause]
it well the games keep on coming right
here on eatv we have more live action
from Lia uberit it's Dad breis and
they'll be facing greno well that should
be a really interesting matchup
atmosphere I'm sure we're going to get
an absolute Bel to
Derek a very timely
interception it'll be a throw they have
to clear
it
icardi Neymar well they can say a big
thank you to the goalkeeper that was
inspirational well that's as good as a
goal at the other end brilliant saf from
The Keeper a header it was but a pretty
straightforward safely well it's an easy
header Derek and he made it look really
difficult and there to
intervene
verati oh really commanding
goalkeeping well a chance here perhaps
to invigorate their aerial
targets and the substitution will occur
now it's Neymar's corner and he clears
the danger well another Corner following
on from the last
[Music]
one played into the center of the Box a
routine
[Applause]
save
BSG doing well to win it
back oh tremendous
[Applause]
block well a poor ball giving possession
back to the
opposition really poor timing and some
will argue that he was asking for a
yellow
card
he'll take this
on well not quite what he wanted to do
with the
[Applause]
[Applause]
pass
son not the pass he had in
mind
and he's won the ball very good reading
of the game to win possession
[Applause]
back just 10 minutes to
go PSG on the attack as the minutes sck
away what can they do in the closing
phas well it might still work out for
them
[Applause]
now PSG moving the ball forward what can
they do from here and he's broken
free and still an
opportunity well nothing comes of
[Applause]
it an important
interception well they know they need to
stop
him as clean as a whistle that
challenge really getting stuck in
tremendous intuition to win it
back on the attack is there to be late
drama munier and foiled by van
dijk and just the one minute left in
normal time
here and the referee sees that as a foul
free get
given substitution it is for
PSG you can see he was feeling the
pressure but gave it a go anyway not
close though well it was definitely
worth the chance just got the technique
a little bit
off
Neymar and the keeper can
GA so the final w and the two teams
evenly matched Lee your thoughts on
psg's side of the

all the action for you live right here
on eatv
good evening everyone plenty of reasons
to expect a compelling contest tonight
here on the French Capital Paris we're
at the PAC pass my name is Derek Ray
with me in the commentary position is
the Arsenal Legend Lee Dixon and we have
action from Liga Uber Eats coming right
up for you it's Paris San facing santen
well he successfully got past
him
and the PSG
Corner played into the center of the box
and I think it's fair to say the
pressure from the defender push him off
a
[Applause]
bit introducing the Paris San starters
Allison begins in goal Marco Veri starts
alongside Paul Pogba in central Midfield
and rather than use a strike partnership
they've gone with just the one player in
[Applause]
attack good defending to prevent the
chance and now the delivery well they
couldn't take advantage of the
[Applause]
chance
Yu and now
Palencia well here's the table and based
on preseason expectations I think you
can say Ren fans are entitled to be
disappointed well you have to look twice
at the table to realize they're not in a
Champions League place and that's
Unthinkable it really is the club's in
turmoil way below the standards that
have been set accountability that's the
key in any club top to
bottom they've lost possession Paris
s well victory for PSG in the last game
against Le how will they Faire today Lee
well they conceded two away from home
last time but they scored three might be
a bit well good clean catch by The
Keeper
[Applause]
Holland this attack looks highly
promising and in with a real chance can
he finish well he had the measure of it
the goalkeeper Corner
awarded fired in by
Neymar and with the
goalkeeper
opportunity to deliver the
cross well this is the day his debut
forthcoming and it's going to be
interesting to see what he produces what
do you think we should expect can they
Forge ahead no chance missed well
there's a big opportunity squandered
there he'll be disappointed with that
there has been so much speculation in
terms of whether the transfer would go
ahead
but it will go ahead Lee well the figure
Derek being banded around is around 30
million what sort of player does that
get you well it gets you a decent player
he's got the quality but will he have
the impact we'll have to wait and
see no
that and they will be awarded a free
kick for that he's been admonished by
the referee he's now got to walk
something of a tight rope yeah he knows
exactly where he stand look at the
referee how he's told him off there no
yellow card but certainly knows what the
referee's
thinking Paul Pogba this is
Neymar
verzi a bit sloppy in
[Applause]
possession he's in here but it can't get
get through oh Stella a defensive work
to get back and win
possession and a wild wild attempt from
long range not one for his highlight
reel well it's a poor choice he's got
other options on why is he shooting from
that
distance Seri
[Applause]
Palencia
[Applause]
El
Arabi well read to put an end to that
attack applying vigorous pressure
sustained pressure on they have the ball
now can he finish got to it easily the
[Applause]
keeper
demele
this is Neymar well couldn't quite find
his
[Applause]
teammate
[Applause]
Holland and putting his body on the
[Applause]
line
[Applause]
well sloppy in
[Applause]
possession take it
away now Paul Pogba a goal on The Bu of
sustained pressure now they deserv itly
hold the
Advantage so the match has restarted 1 n
[Applause]
here toed
it and
[Applause]
Neymar onto h
that is a very fine challenge in
difficult
circumstances now counterattacking
possibilities
here El
Arabi still behind but the pressure
mounting shot attempted a routine
save Juan baka
no lot for Neymar in the passing
department and he's beaten him here fine
goalkeeping to push that away well he's
given a corner the
[Applause]
referee played into the center of the
box and not an attempt he'll be terribly
proud of
and the electronic forward showing one
additional
minute well great read there to
intercept and that is that for the first
half here in the French
[Applause]
Capital the teams are ready to have a go
at each other again as the second half
commences
