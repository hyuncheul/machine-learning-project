this is valin's top five Sheriff skins
in my opinion fifth goes to ion this
Sheriff skin is an absolute classic it's
so clean and so good fourth goes to
Singularity the sheriff fits the
singularity style literally perfectly
and it makes an insanely nice skin third
goes to Arcane arguably the most famous
skin in the entire game and it just so
happens to be pretty sick second goes to
kurinami this skin is Elite and Riot
absolutely killed it with the animations
and it deserves to beat this high up
first goes to Neo Frontier something
about this skin just makes it perfect
and the fact that it acts like two skins
in one is a huge bonus too
