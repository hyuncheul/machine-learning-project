do this to win more with yodu if you got
the yodu ultimate ready of course you're
going to go deep into the enemy's
territory and usually when yodu players
spot an enemy they will flesh go out
their ultimate kill the enemy and then
teleport back I'm back this is funny and
all but there's a better method they
yodu players I know it's hard to believe
but you're not the only one that's
playing this game so ask your teammates
to assist you take this round for
example in this round yodu went to the
enemy Phoenix waited there till his
teammate estra used the star then went
out of his ulti got the kill and
teleported back I'm back fck yes yes
