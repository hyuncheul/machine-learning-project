[Music]
of never let
[Music]
[Music]
thatp mess with my
there's more tension in the air than
usual and you can understand why if they
get the victory today they'll be assured
of a place in the promotion match and
that is nothing to be sniffed
at there's only one place to enjoy the
action and it's right here with us on
eatv and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers r ring every reason
to believe this will be olling I'm Derek
Ray and my commentary partner here on
the Gantry is the former Arsenal and
West Ham player Stuart Robson and the
Chance is on for them to reserve for
themselves a promotion match Place
Stuart tell us about your pre-match
thoughts well Derek it's certainly in
their hands if they win here a promotion
match will be theirs they just need to
put in a good performance it won't be
easy though could
be
[Applause]
opportunity not the best of efforts was
it well it was a great chance but a poor
finish he really should score
[Applause]
there nicely timed tackle
[Applause]
well the prize is in sight one more goal
to be joint top of the club's alltime
scoring chart well this player has been
knocking at the door for a while now and
I fully expect that record to be equal
today let's hope so it will be a great
[Applause]
moment
Jin ball lost by Wanderers
El mamed that needs an accurate
[Applause]
cross clearly took a touch on the way
out of play so a throw in to
[Applause]
come good High
Press well all doing the bit to keep
them
out
every goalkeeper would expect to catch
that
[Applause]
one well that s to put in a clean
tackle and nicely over the top able to
deal with the threat
and very depthly cut
out he has teammates around him well
disappointing end to the
[Applause]
move well the fans want to see a
[Applause]
shot
[Applause]
pesic Wanderers move it forward with
purpose but they dealt with the threat
posed an advantage coming into play and
rightly
so
s
he has time to play it
over not all that hard to deal with
crosses like
that
s plays with a positional sense that is
second to
none
peric
good looking move
this
Jin wasteful from
Wanderers now can they make something
[Applause]
happen well did well to win the ball
back
they couldn't keep
possession and the flag has gone up here
offside the
[Applause]
decision and given away by
Wanderers
room to maneuver on the
wing dangerous
ball looking to cut
inside targets available cross comes in
the clearance wasn't
decisive can he put them in
front she's made a really important
challenge
oh that's a super piece of
Defending options in the middle can they
take the lead here and a goal one nil it
is they've been pushing for the opener
and now they have
it
pic
that's useful play oh nice ball over the
top and the managers will now deliver
their halim
[Applause]
team
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
w
and back in business Wanderers behind
will they be able to find a route back
into the
game oh he's lost possession of the
[Applause]
ball in
[Applause]
possibilities well there was impending
danger but good
defending this looks more than
decent oh it's there for her and it's
gone in the teams separated by two goals
now you cannot say they don't deserve
it
two- n here and the ball is moving
again pesic the referee knew that was
Foul Play but Advantage it
is took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop them and teammates
around
him and keeping it
out
and over it comes well it has come to
nothing this could be
Troublesome opportunity here oh my word
there's excellent timing for you what a
challenge
[Applause]
[Applause]
chance to play it
in well he stopped them in their
tracks so now a
[Applause]
corner who can they pick out well the at
least made the goalkeeper
[Applause]
think and quick thinking
defensively 30 minutes left for
play and he's broken
free a goal as they cut into their
advantage still plenty of life in this
[Applause]
match now the action underway again can
wose push for a
leveler
s El
muhamed a really single-minded piece of
Defending to make sure nothing unto
happen and a good looking ball
well I think you could call that an
escape it looked a certain and
goal
pesic a good Vision there and not the
most convincing of headers when all was
said and done yeah but in the end I
think the defender does enough to make
it very difficult for
[Applause]
him and out of play the pass nearly work
out but not
quite promising attack
[Applause]
this well just the tackle that was
needed and the counter looks on here
options
available Defenders need to cover oh
what a clearance Under Pressure had to
react and did
[Applause]
over it
comes pressing high up has its
advantages brilliantly
blocked oh the flag's gone up and there
wasn't much in
[Applause]
that into the advanced position really
vital inter
[Applause]
reception and they trouble the
opposition this time opportunity and
you've got to credit that magnificent
piece of
Defending and into the last 15 minutes
of
action can he play it
in patience and persistence on the
passing front in the an aim of finding
an
[Applause]
equalizer well goal kick just as it was
looking
[Applause]
promising
s and nothing comes of this
attack it is to be a throw
in
[Applause]
well just listen to the noise in here
these fans are doing everything to get
their team over the finish line and
there's not long left
now well she's certainly not
alone but nothing comes of
it
using space on the opposite flank now
they showing a willingness to attack as
they must given the circumstances time
running out but good defending clattered
out of there and a loss of
concentration how about this for drama
all even once more
[Applause]
astonishing tension building still
level well disappointing end to the move
could be a chance to break
here will he play it
in oh that's a super piece of
Defending a very effective play and they
might be on to something can he put them
in front no is the answer to the
question and that could be so important
at this stage well will they get another
chance that would surely have won the
game for
them well the keeper made that looked
relatively easy in truth it
wasn't and so the final whistle has
sounded at the end of the game the teams
not to be divided from the point of view
of the hosts how did they Fair well it's
a horrible feeling when you can seeed so
late in the game they thought they had
the game one but a lack of concentration
has cost them dear
[Music]
[Music]
here
[Music]
[Applause]
s
[Music]
we
[Music]
[Music]
Hold
On
Up
hey can you help me real
quick Famous Last Words a draw is all
they need it's true in this case a draw
to make it through to the promotion
match but can they produce the
performance they need and get over the
[Music]
[Applause]
line next on EA
TV
[Music]
[Applause]
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be in trolling I'm
Derek Ray and sitting alongside me ready
to provide all the technical and
tactical analysis it's Stuart Robson and
if all goes to plan can't miss surely oh
not to be stopping a certain and
goal
that's a good
pass but he made that interception
looked routine in truth it wasn't and
cleared behind for what is going to be a
corner
kick now sending it in it might still be
problematic
and problem solved for
now and unable to keep the
ball and it cross the touch line so a
throw in
[Applause]
here Mor well that's a decent looking
attack this well didn't go to plan in
the end this could be
[Applause]
[Applause]
Troublesome s and there it breaks down
but credit to the
[Applause]
defense
[Applause]
and a lot to like about this
attack and he read it
well Distributing it well opportunity it
is and a goal now they've broken through
one n
here so underway again here one n to
score and the non nonsense
[Applause]
clearance
holding on to what they have is the
priority apparently deserves credit for
winning the ball
[Applause]
back unable to keep the
[Applause]
ball
could be dangerous well it was easy on
the eye but the interception was made
they got the touch on the ball a throw
in
now and nothing comes of that
[Applause]
attack so deflection and it will be a
throw
in well found wanting in the throw
Department
there
[Applause]
Chavez and support
available well it came to nothing in the
[Applause]
end excellent use of the ball as they
make their way forward can he finish
this oh last ditch defending at its very
finest
and that's great work to keep it in
[Applause]
play nice ball to switch the point of
[Applause]
attack really getting stuck
in good weight on that pass managed to
get it out of
[Applause]
there and possession lost
there in position the threat was there
but no problems
now and no nonsense defensive
clearance can't miss
surely superbly read and executed must
finish tremendous defending to Stonewall
[Applause]
him real chance wants it
brilliantly and a useful cross pretty
comfortable piece of
Defending
and a tidy
ball and players waiting on the
[Applause]
center
Chavez and to seted
[Applause]
it
effective challenge the high press was
on and the Chance is
on right the first 45 minutes have come
and gone here in
[Applause]
wesa
out
so back underway and an intriguing
second half in
Prospect getting in there to
intercept
nice switch of
[Applause]
play Spot on with that
[Applause]
challenge
[Applause]
that's how to dispossess your
[Applause]
opponent can he find the right
pass making sure nothing came of
it released it
nicely
very alert defending to put a stop to
the
[Applause]
chance and that's an important
intervention was an important piece of
[Applause]
Defending
[Applause]
El
mamed well this is what you call passing
with
confidence but then the one that fails
to hit its
Target and the counter looks on here
options
available play towards the back post not
all that convincing
defensively this could level it oh a
vital piece of last it's
defending and the pass was just that
little bit off nearly found its
Target well through it goes but that's
not going to trouble The
Defenders and this situation could be
dangerous the importance of that tackle
cannot be
[Applause]
overstated
s the referee's letting it go as they
keep the ball and do they mean business
on this
occasion well nothing comes of it it
looked
[Applause]
promising well I have to say these fans
have been excellent they you believe
they're going to get back into
[Applause]
this well sloppy in
[Applause]
possession and a chance to whip it in
here comes it
back oh good
save well can they draw a level here the
crowd certainly think
so
[Applause]
playing it
in doing well to win it back what can
they do from
[Applause]
here K It On The Ground slightly off
Target
[Applause]
however s
wilting under the pressure and now they
try to go forward and will it be the
leveler and he's got and score to level
it
again so underway again following the
goal that made things level oh nice ball
over the
top elting to cross into the center
still not
clear winning back
possession not the best
[Applause]
clearance and forward they go again can
they win this must take the lead here
huge
[Applause]
block and the throw in fourth
coming
El
moamed and giving the ball
away
[Applause]
Chavez
and this could make certain for them oh
a St piece of
Defending really good wide
play well they still have designs on the
win and the cross goes in and they got
into that Crossing position but dealt
with
defensively and there she is in with a
Chance oh strong hand on the ball just
knocked it out of there
that's a very fine piece of tackling
must put it away and in oh yes exactly
what they were hoping to produce they've
delivered the
goal well they're attacking but time is
the great
enemy I think you've got to conclude
that was good refereeing a free kick in
the end after initially playing
Advantage but it just wasn't
there and that is the end of the contest
and not the happy outcome as
far concentration late on and it's cost
them de they'll need to get over that
[Applause]
quickly
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
n oh
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
imag even when
it's
your I
[Music]
see
that
[Music]
I wish the world did
you so I could
[Music]
see
[Music]
[Music]
it is a division match with so much on
the line and they know the target at
hand a draw or better and they'll make
it true to the promotion match but can
they do it with the pressure on
today
[Applause]
stay with us we're live
[Music]
next and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be enrolling my
name is Derek Ray and ready with his
tactics board to provide all the
analysis is Stuart Robson and the Chan
is on for them to reserve for themselves
a promotion match Place how do you see
it panning out Stuart well I think Derek
this will be tent but they know a good
performance here and a draw at least
will give them access to a promotion
match it should be an interesting
game and that was a very fine
[Applause]
read gives it a go well just over the
crossbar excellent
effort
[Applause]
a very timely
interception well we simply had to
feature him today after he broke the
club's goal scoring record in his last
appearance yeah what a goal scorer but
I'm sure there's still a lot more to
come from this player includ there it is
the opening goal of this match and what
a start they've
made so the action underway once more
and the onus is on the old boys to come
up with the right
response in position oh a challenge of
the highest
[Applause]
order
[Applause]
gallager well possibilities in the
center and the cross is immediately
dealt
with feeding it through and the flag has
gone up
[Applause]
offside a very good tackle
[Applause]
and the advantage AC crru to the
attacking side woods with
it now to take it
away well showing good
[Applause]
vision
Gallagher they need to get tighter and a
good challenge to bring that attack to
an
[Applause]
end
[Applause]
Davids and Cristiano has it now well a
classic example of how to
intercept could be
threatening
Bea
perfectly positioned to take it
[Applause]
away on she goes in possession can she
pick the right option delivered into the
box ah goalkeeper ball not the best of
crosses really was
[Applause]
it
gallaga and it crossed the touch line l
so a throw in
here and reading it absolutely
superbly and back now with
Cristiano and he has options
available no problems for the
keeper and that's very intelligent play
to win back possession
[Applause]
[Applause]
Carlson
[Applause]
Davids a promising looking attack but
comes to nothing in the
end oh good Vision well it nearly worked
out and a fine
[Applause]
interception still trying to make
something
happen oh you don't want to lose the
ball in that position and deflected
beyond the by line so a corner
here trying to pick out a teammate and
clearing his lines
and that is
[Applause]
offside just the challenge that was
required good width here from the old
boys good ball played over and a goal
real excitement here The
Equalizer
well here it is again and it's all about
the pacing transition they're so quick
to get out from the back and he makes
the Finish Look So Easy what a good goal
that
[Applause]
is El
[Applause]
mamed
oh nice ball over the top to chase
tenacious tackling excellent defending
there and the whistle is sounded for
halime in this
[Applause]
game
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
he
[Music]
away they go again second half is
underway
[Applause]
here and slipped through beautifully but
a intercepted when it looked as though
they might be
[Applause]
in
[Applause]
Gallagher woods with
it now in a more than decent
position that's a good looking pass is
this the moment and a goal to
reestablish their advantage just look at
the
celebrations
ru
Gallagher
Woods getting in there to intercept in a
position from which they could
potentially do a bit of damage here
surely and a goal another one two in
quick succession no wonder they're
celebrating
Gallagher Ramos with
it
who can he pick
[Applause]
out and Cristiano has it now oh that's
an expert piece of
[Applause]
Defending
could
[Applause]
be i' would be a bit annoyed to have
lost the
[Applause]
ball 30 minutes left for
play well it was a foul but good use of
Advantage by the
referee oh yes what a pass just straying
offside
Gallagher well there's an example of how
to press high
[Applause]
up is it going to
be an alert piece of
Defending bodies forward and the break
looks on well an example of a
Counterattack that went
[Applause]
nowhere champ
delivered into the box but goalkeeper
ball disappointingly for
[Applause]
them
woods and fed back to the
goalkeeper
Davids delightful
pass oh yes dispatching it with a plum
wonderful
goal the action is underway again
different fi to the proceedings can the
old boys find another
goal 20 minutes to
go
Woods
Carlson
a very effective challenge put
in well there was impending danger but
good
defending and now Ru has
it could be and a goal the going to take
some stopping now two in front
here
so the current score line
42
Ru woods with
[Applause]
it an encouraging looking move from the
old boys delivering it into the box but
it wasn't quite as good as it looked
when it left the
boot
Chavez woods with
it there to win it
back and he has options available superb
looking
pass chance to finish and a goal devot
the final stamp on it that will do
it woods with
it and winning it
back and plenty of scope to be creative
in that wide
[Applause]
position
opportunity
oh the penalty's been given and it's not
what they had in mind it's falling apart
for
[Applause]
them well no card just a warning and a
fair few protestations well not every
foul is a yellow card I think the
referee is right
here and a chance maybe to settle this
the keeper going in the right direction
and saving
it
can he deliver it with
accuracy and cleared behind for what is
going to be a corner
[Applause]
[Music]
kick and that's going to result in a
goal kick
[Applause]
rewarded for that brilliant High
Press that is tackling of the highest
[Applause]
order so two minutes to be added on at
the end it's a waited
pass well you can't really head them any
better than that but the goalkeeper was
up to the task and a corner kick the
referees
verdict playing it
in what a commitment to
defending and there it is the full-time
whistle here and it's a victory for the
visitors well it was a very assured
performance wasn't it I was particularly
impressed with their play going forward
really Lively almost cutting through at
will at times the result was never much
in doubt if I'm
[Music]
[Music]

[Applause]

so much on the line and we can't wait
for the
excitement the full match in its
entirety is coming up next on
eatv one of the great things about
football is that no one knows for sure
what's going to happen let's see what
unfolds here tonight I'm Derek Ray and
my commentary partner as always is
Stuart Robson and how will they fair in
this their first test of a promotion
match in the division how do you see it
panning out Stuart yeah it's certainly a
big game today up to now they've been
really good can they just go that little
bit further and put in an excellent
performance
here oh credit for that piece of ball
winning now what can she do
[Applause]
next and they'll get ready for the throw
[Applause]
in
[Applause]
wall a very timely
interception well there was never any
doubt we were always going to be
highlighting him after his exploits in
the last match breaking the club's goal
scoring record yeah what a goal scorer
but I'm sure there's still a lot more to
come from this player including today
maybe it's a remarkable
achievement and a promising looking
attack but comes to nothing in the
end
Fox
and the emphasis is on creativity and a
chance for the
lead oh commanding
[Applause]
goalkeeping and overc comes the
corner on a decent delivery and it's
gone out of play goal kick coming
up
[Applause]
and clears the
[Applause]
danger
[Applause]
Fox might lead to a chance spot on with
that
tackle
[Applause]
and quick thinking
defensively and the referee sensibly
allowing them to carry on Advantage with
them well it was one foul too many and
the referee simply had to blow for the
free
kick and Woodman has it
given away by
dragons well very effective play in
possession a fine reading of the
situation physically strong and secure
on the
ball well space for them
here fantastic work to thwart the
[Applause]
danger
chance for him to get in behind
maybe cany slot it
home the high press was on and the Chan
is on he'll be delighted to have won the
ball having made that difficult
[Applause]
Challenge and that is going to be a free
[Applause]
kick well they have the ball once
[Applause]
more brilliant piece of
skill now who can she pick out taking
care of business defensively
here really good strong tackle and it'll
be a throw
in not much time to make up his
mind it has gone over the touch line for
what'll be a throw
in good looking
cross
and a goal now they've broken through
one n
here so the ball rolling again with the
score line standing at 1
n oh and a perfect ball now how about
[Applause]
this oh that's Splendid play he'll be
breathing a s of relief ball one over
the touch line for a throw
[Applause]
in bodies forward and the break looks
on well it broke down
alas Distributing it
well magnificent
[Applause]
defending to the Penalty area who's
going to win this J shot blocked but
still
[Applause]
alive very quick thinking
[Applause]
there plenty of support
here looking for someone to play it to
go genuine chance and defending right on
the line and a good take under Jess
[Applause]
there if you're wondering about stoppage
time one minute to be added
on the switch of play
now now the managers will now deliver
their halim team talks we're at the end
of 45 minutes in this game
out
[Music]
away they go again second half is
underway
here
[Applause]
oh that's a super piece of
Defending released it
[Applause]
[Applause]
nicely Fox
now who can she pass it to well no
pressure on the keeper for a
[Applause]
cross oh he's giv it away
El
mamed
Chavez possession given away
[Applause]
unfortunately and Woodman has
it and with the advantage no reason why
you shouldn't play Keep
ball
Woodman oh nice ball over the
[Applause]
top el
mamed plenty of supports
here and he thed the attack with a
masterful
tackle
in behind for him to Chase and tting
through well that's the sign of a well
organized
[Applause]
defense getting
forward chance to finish ball is loose
and there it is an almost intuitive
piece of
finishing well as you can see the first
save is a good one but they can't react
quickly enough to the second ball the
keepers a bit unlucky
really and support
[Applause]
available well they stopped them in
their track
good move in the making from the dragons
that's a nice looking ball a decent
effort but the keeper read it all the
[Applause]
way James
[Applause]
and into the last 20
minutes and quick thinking
defensively might be a chance to
break could be
threatening and oh it's in we cannot
declare this contest over they still the
lead Fox
and the referee sensibly allowing them
to carry on Advantage with them and very
nicely positioned to Win It
Back Now options are plenty oh crucial
tackle
brilliant a chance for him to get in
behind maybe and just has to remain
calm and a goal he's doubled his total
for the day in superb scoring for
so they get the ball moving again 3-1
the score line here what's going to
happen next nice looking
pass El mamed the cross is
on excellent assessment of the situation
at the
back could pull one back here
well last gas defending but brilliant
[Applause]
defending not too fussy in clearing his
lines well breaking at PACE is always a
possibility and in a perfect position to
cut it
[Applause]
out can he get one back oh he can and
who's to say there's not enough time for
them to level matters it would be quite
the
story and Woodman has
it
Fox they need to get tighter
here Crossing
possibilities shaping to shoot oh the
crossbar is still reverberating and able
to get a body in the
way well just listen to the atmosphere
in here the fans doing every bit to try
and spur their team on for this
equalizer well do they have it in them
to level
this well nothing comes of it it looked
promising well the stoppage time
situation one minute here
Chavez how about the cross and the
snuffing out of the Cross
there well all doing their bit to keep
them
out and there goes the final whistle
much to the disappointment of their
supporters well Derek it was a
hardfought contest which neither side
completely dominated but the result will
certainly hurt them they need to bounce
back next time
out
