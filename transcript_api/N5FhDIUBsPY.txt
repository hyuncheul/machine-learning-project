a city imbued with the spirit of
excitement and a stadium enveloped by
anticipation this has all the
ingredients necessary for a tasty
football recipe and both sets of players
are ready to throw everything into

mouthwatering prospect
awaits the action is live on
[Applause]
[Music]
eatv well nights like these are just
what you hope for as a spectator a warm
welcome I'm Derek Ray in the commentary
position and I'm joined for expert
analysis by my partner Stuart Robson and
we've got Premier League action coming
right up it is Nottingham Forest versus
Arsenal thanks Derek well both managers
will be reminding their players of
starting the game quickly pinning the
opposition back playing the ball forward
and regaining possession as quickly as
possible hopefully we get a really good
game
here
[Applause]
he'll be breathing a sigh of relief ball
one and here's how Nottingham Forest
will line up well it's great to see a
team playing with Wingers in a 4-33 but
they've got to be effective both with
their dribbling and their crosses
otherwise they'll become bit part
players and this is the Arsenal starting
11 Martin erigor plays alongside Dean
rice in central Midfield and the
centerpiece of the attack today is
Gabrielle
Jesus he read the situation defensively
and did his
job well not giving the opposition a
look in that strong
play Kai habits habits and it's in one n
they've breached the
defense
well here's another look and you can see
what a good finish this is he holds off
the defender brilliantly and keeps his
composure that's a great
[Applause]
goal well all eyes are on the manager
what's he going to do to turn this
around go for Arenal one then 29 Kai
hav Chris
Wood and a tidy
[Applause]
tackle looking position you've got to
say and Chris Wood
good it needs an accurate
[Applause]
cross well it did look promising but no
threat in the
[Applause]
end
havet now zinenko
[Applause]
Kai
[Applause]
havet Gabrielle well they're a bit like
a passing machine and you can understand
why they want to play it that way in
front as they
are nice great
opportunity surely
now and quick thinking
[Applause]
defensively Chris
Wood wonderfully weighted
pass well it was easy on the die but the
interception was
[Applause]
made well that's how to put in a clean
tackle strength and control a big part
of his
[Applause]
game gives
white options and the
[Applause]
middle
wood well no way
through under real pressure defensively
will they pay the price what a genuine
opportunity but it was squandered go
kick
William
SBA and Arsenal Now find themselves in
potentially a dangerous position and
credit is due for that good piece of
[Applause]
Defending and support
available yes nicely timed
tackle not a huge chunk of added Time 1
minute
sare a chance then for the respective
managers to address their Chargers it is
halime
here
arsal with the lead going into this
second half but no room for
complacency good physical play well
sadly they just couldn't keep
possession how about the
cross
rice and now
habits and a chance
erard
in
position well I think you could call
that an escape it looked a certain
[Applause]

this
game well a poor pass it was no getting

[Applause]
20o
white now with
jinho Martin erard he's got to
score that is tackling of the highest
order
Hudson
ooi ibraim
sare now
aier Nicolas
Dominguez and it's with Gibbs
white can they fashion something they
need a
[Applause]
goal
Gib white this could be the equalizer
still
possibilities and they can't quite take
advantage in the
end and unable to hang on to the ball
that's good pressing for
you and time for the change now to reped
by number 19 Leandro
and just five minutes
remaining
Dominguez
sare and the ball with
buy rice with it
and the electronic board showing one
additional
minute so there goes the final whistle
it ends in a victory for Arsenal maximum
points for them what did you make of it
all well once again they were so solid
defensively and of course the backline
get a lot of credit but the players in
front of them work so hard to close the
opposition down it just makes the
Defenders job that much easier it's
another clean
sheet
