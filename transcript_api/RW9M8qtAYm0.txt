really should have pulsers racing every
reason to believe this will be olling my
name is Derek Ray positioned here on the
commentary Gantry and sitting next to me
ready to give you all the analysis is
Stuart Robson and the stage is set for
club's match action what do you
anticipate seeing Stuart well Derek when
looking forward to this game you can't
help but notice there are some great
matchups all over the pitch particularly
in those Central areas whichever team
wins more of those battles will win the
game
[Applause]
onto Bruno possession
[Applause]
one good bit of closing down that's very
good refereeing to let the play Flow
well trying to let them continue but now
he's gone back and awarded the free
kick kibali
Crossing
possibilities and the cross into the
middle attending to his defensive
[Applause]
chores Ritz Advantage
played
Barnard very alert defending to put a
stop to the
chance well nothing comes of
it well a very important record broken
last time out you're looking at the
club's new all-time top scorer yeah what
a great achievement but he won't want to
stop there he loves scor oh opportunity
here Stuart marvelous
anticipation
that's not a bad ball making sure
nothing came of
it
Yi
Kang now with
Bruno you can sense the threaters there
and the problem not completely
solved that is defending of the highest
[Applause]
order
K oh nice ball over the
[Applause]
top
and moving the ball forward with genuine
purpose
[Applause]
here will he play it in just have to
look a bit Lively given the
[Applause]
pressure Bale he has teammates around
him released it
nicely a f
cross keeper did his job to begin
with and the move breaks
[Applause]
down
[Applause]
kibali
now they've lost
[Applause]
it and back with
K and nicely over the top the verdict is
offside
[Applause]
here
beautiful pass oh big opportunity he
can't hold on to
it on the time for
coolheads
Dio untiy in
[Applause]
possession throw in's
given can he play it
in not quite the clearance they were
hoping
for well they can't quite take advantage
in the
[Applause]
end
Bale oh lovely weighted ball they might
be
in well there was impending danger but
good
defending High pressing at its
best
[Applause]
promising attack
[Applause]
this it's with kib
Bali they've given it
away
showing real patience can they Forge
ahead well they were very patient but
they no longer have the
ball from one side of the pitch to the
other and so it is the first half story
has been
r
the
[Applause]
so back underway here into the second
[Applause]
half really good challenge
Ador clears it
away well a chance here perhaps to
invigorate the aerial
[Applause]
targets exploiting the wide area and
he's broken free
oh that is an outrageously good stop
well great reflexes from The Keeper he
did brilliantly
[Applause]
there and overcomes the
[Applause]
corner well they couldn't keep
it
Barnard onto Bruno and he stopped them
just when they looked
menacing good looking
ball laid into the box and the noson
[Applause]
clearance
Barnard possession
lost the textbook
interception with the LIC
gr5 JK and he has options available
oh he's given the ball
away and we're into the final half
hour and back with
K
Barnard moving the ball more than
decently but can they take the lead but
then the commentator's curse comes into
play and do they mean business on this
occasion that's not a bad ball and it's
offside that was very
[Applause]
close
Divo an important
interception he's waiting in the middle
this could have
possibilities magnificent challenge to
win it
back
bail good looking cross well it's a
moment he would like to have back if
[Applause]
possible good work to regain
possession
and out of Play It Goes
alas well as the stats show us this has
been a really even game so far it just
hasn't been enough G or invention in the
top third of the field from either team
which needs to change at some
point kitki but he's certainly not
alone that's a useful cross dealt with
that ball
comfortably
and possession changing
hands it's there for him well fantastic
reflex
[Applause]
action well they fancy a short one and
whipped into the
box and problems sold for
now
kibali it's with
kibali
aquilani oh nice ball over the top and
snuffed out the danger
immediately
[Applause]
10 minutes to
go and the goal at this stage could be
decisive promising
pass and the cross is immediately dealt
with Now options are
plenty really bright looking attack good
defending in the end and danger averted
for
now Bale in behind for him to chase flag
Rays for
[Applause]
offside
aquilani it's with
kibali every pass hitting its touch it
well they couldn't keep that sequence
going
[Music]
unfortunately oh nice
[Applause]
ball well they certainly thinking about
a winner teammates in the middle really
good buildup but no end
product well the electronic board
showing one additional
[Applause]
minute can they Forge ahead yes is the
answer and that could be oh so
[Applause]
important and there goes the final
whistle much to the disappointment of
their supporters well Derek certainly
not their best performance was
[Applause]
it
it doesn't get much better than being
able to call yourself the record scorer
for a football club but last time out we
saw him make history and revel in the
moment now the prospect of more goals
from this highly gifted footballer who
rarely fails to deliver on the
pitch it's coming up on EA
TV
one of the great things about football
is that no one knows for sure what's
going to happen let's see what unfolds
here tonight I'm Derek Ray and sitting
alongside me ready to provide all the
technical and tactical analysis is
Stuart Robson and the stage is set for
club's match action Stuart what are your
expectations for today pressing high up
has its
advantages
Kang after the foul a chance to
contemplate what is next and perhaps a
goal from his free
[Applause]
kick has eyes for goal nothing wrong
with the idea on the free kick but the
goalkeeper has
[Applause]
it
can someone get on the end of this oh
great header Smart Stop though a corner
will
[Applause]
ensue
and nicely over the top well a deaf
clearance corner
conceded Keen to take it short here and
whipped into the box
and he clears the
danger oh good defending to stop a
decent looking
[Applause]
attack
Ali Rossi with
it and he read it
well are we going to see history written
today one more goal to become the club's
alltime leading scorer well it's only a
matter of time before he does break the
record let's hope he can do it today
because it's such an achievement what a
legend he
[Applause]
is
Rossi not much defensive cover there
there on the flank but he sted it out of
there without much
fuss incisive
pass well gifting away
[Applause]
possession and Rossi on the
ball Ali
Castillo
Ali committed
challenge
K
Divo
and back with
K onto Bruno a creative look about this
a fine reading of the
[Applause]
situation and a throw in fourth
[Applause]
coming Bernard
[Applause]
and players waiting on the
center so a goal kick is what's coming
up
here Yi for
Adriano Adano and have a fantastic day
fromer
[Applause]
vention and pressing from the
front here's Castillo but a good place
to win it back and let's see what it
leads to couldn't hang on to it
again
Ali
losing possession here now do they mean
business on this
[Applause]
occasion
jeo can he do it and a goal now they
have the opener and now they can
celebrate
so underway again here one n the
score it's with
[Applause]
Castillo well there's a really stylish
piece of
[Applause]
running untiy in
possession
could be dangerous and pure Instinct
from The Keeper well a top class
reaction from a top class goalkeeper
brilliant
stuff so the corner played into the box
it hasn't come to very
much and crossed in there clearance left
a bit to be
desired just have to look a bit Lively
given the
pressure now in a more than decent
position well somehow the goalkeeper got
to
[Applause]
it now how about the short
corner
and
[Applause]
blocked cross could be useful can he
compose himself he'll be delighted to
have won the ball having made that
difficult
Challenge and the electronic board
showing one additional
minute and with that the first half
draws to a
close
[Applause]
see
well they've got things going again here
and I wonder what kind of second half we
have in store for
[Applause]
us
[Applause]
[Applause]
getting the better of his opponent well
that's how to do it inside your own
penalty
area
well they'll be happy to have regained
[Applause]
possession C it back marvelous
[Applause]
anticipation Castillo
[Applause]
and Rossi on the
ball
[Applause]
Ali and it crossed the touch line so a
throw in
here well it looked highly promising but
they got nothing out of it nice must
score well it might still work out for
them and a goal well it looks easy when
you can put them away like
that Rossi with
it it's with
Castillo and moving the ball forward
with genuine purpose here that's a high
quality
pass really committed def
[Applause]
defending it will be a goal kick
[Applause]
here now with
Bruno
jeo possession given away away
unfortunately great out of play by the
goalkeeper and it'll be a throw
[Applause]
in that is how to apply the
pressure might be on to something with
that ball CR into the penalty area but
keeper ball they'll be disappointed with
that
delivery
Bale and passing it
[Applause]
well
Ali mopping up
defensively 20 minutes to go in this one
they've given it
away a really committed Challenge and
it's gone out for a
[Applause]
throw the switch of play
now and very Def L cut
out and room now out on the flank that's
an effective cross aimed at the back
post well capable of a better clearance
than that this might be the perfect
counterattacking
opportunity good looking
cross and there it breaks down but
credit to the
defense
and he cuts in from the wing but the
danger averted for now and he clears it
out of Harm's
[Applause]
[Applause]
Way and there's the delivery and in a
crowded area the keeper has managed to
get there
there just 10 minutes remaining
[Applause]
here
rosit it would be a bit annoyed to have
lost the
ball needs to tread
carefully
good distribution big chance and the
keeper technical skills there for all to
see well from that close in that's a
really good save such good
reflexes and short it
is chance here offside by quite a lot
it's with
Rossi and support
available oh nice
ball could reduce the deficit oh dear
that moment might come back to haunt
them a bad miss you sense that had to go
in if they to turn this around they
simply haven't been at the races
today the high press was on and that's a
fantastic
tackle must score it could be up for
grabs and holding on to it at the second
time of
asking the referee blows for full time
it ends at a victory for the home team
no complaints from the fans here well
Derek it was a comfortable win in the
end fully deserved their Victory because
they dominated every aspect of the game
it was a really good result for them
here today
what
that's
for
what
e
that's
for
