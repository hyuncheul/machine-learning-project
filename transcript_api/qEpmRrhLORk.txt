I want to ask him one word of kaer you
benefit a lot from the new item system I
wonder if to ask clean Riot eyes he is
fine spot or if he's strong I might go
back to certain anything not very
playable State we think he was probably
weak in season 13 so even though he got
buffed 3% we're willing to let him sit
for a bit that's kind of the idea that
said he might be a little strong so I
wouldn't be surprised if he got nerfed
in the future but oh God
