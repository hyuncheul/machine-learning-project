right a crucial day stands in front of
them the knowledge that a win is
required to make it through to the
promotion match and no doubt about it
their opponents won't be of a mind to do
them any favors at
all the action is next on EA
TV and welcome to a game that really
should have pulses racing every reason
to believe this will be olling I'm your
match commentator Derek Ray at the
microphone and sitting alongside me is
the former Arsenal West Ham and
commentary Midfield player Stuart Robson
and if things go well for them they can
qualify for a promotion match what might
we see today Stuart well Derek it's
certainly in their hands if they win
here a promotion match will be theirs
they just need to put in a good
performance it won't be easy
[Applause]
though Özil had a chance to whip it in
here oh might be well somehow the
goalkeeper got to
[Applause]
it and he's fired over the corner and
early goal it is the ideal
opening now back underway and one n it
is let's see what happens
next
the
bellinghausen
hadu the referee knew that was Foul Play
but Advantage it
is Def and a strong
[Applause]
tackle
[Applause]
Reed and this toivel
it and the referee has awarded a corner
following that
touch well what an opport opportunity
but really good defending you've got to
say well he's given it
[Applause]
[Applause]
away and nothing comes of that
attack No Nonsense CLE
[Applause]
def into the advanced position and the
cross has promise it's in they're
looking really relaxed and confident and
not giving the opposition much of a look
in well here it is again just look at
the quality of the Cross it's inch
perfect and then through on goal he just
goes for power and smashes it past the
keeper there's no stopping that what a
great
finish
the
Aguero
[Applause]
Bon Reed
now
Crossing
opportunity big chance oh blocked
it
Herman
Azu
mavuba
def that needs an accurate cross
went in strongly
decisively a bit of Running Room now on
the
wing and drawing it
back and clears the
danger if there's John Scott in the
stadium can you please make yourself
known to the nearest thank you strong
but fair
tackle Advantage coming into play and
rightly
so he's block
[Applause]
it who's going to get on the end of it
and a confident
clearance chance maybe to use the
counterattacking ability to good
[Applause]
effect
alexe really favors this position and
passing it well options at the back post
here managed to get it out of there
textbook defending Inside the
Box well the fans are certainly having
their say just listen to them they
thought that was a
penalty wilting under the pressure and
now they try to go forward and trouble
is brewing and a goal he's put it away A
celebratory
moment well I have to say he's done
really well here he's in the right place
and then a decent finish that's a good
goal well this is threatening to get out
of hand just look at the score
line Denning
Housen
[Applause]
the
mauba ad
do now the outcome is a free kick here
[Applause]
andu alexe offside the
[Applause]
decision
Aguero
def an effective
Challenge
mauba and we will have just one
additional
minute the first half here comes to an
end
[Applause]
I like it I like
so the two teams have switched around
and the second half is
underway Benning
well the pass not finding its
Target good ball to switch the
[Applause]
play
heril and the cross goes in well this
could really help the cause oh surely
and there's the goal she was hoping for
now she can
[Applause]
celebrate
well just watch this again a change of
pace a change of Direction and a decent
finish that's a very good
goal a lopsided contest
[Applause]
40 the back of
challenge
and a free kick awarded by the
[Applause]
referee can they take
advantage pressure applied can they make
something of
it
[Applause]
herio
Reed and quick thinking
defensively
the referee correctly decided to play
Advantage good
tackle 30 minutes to go
then oh he's lost possession and
threading it through and offside by a
very small
[Applause]
margin
Adu well he's lost it a really good
pass oh great
[Applause]
vision delivered into the area here well
far from the cross he had in mind goal
kick it is takes the shot terrific save
[Applause]
delivering it and clearing it
[Applause]
away
Barton what can they do to stop him
running at
[Applause]
them but the danger averted for now
[Applause]
[Applause]
Aguero and the referee spotted the foul
but has played Advantage possession
one that's a good looking
[Applause]
ball well that's common sense refereeing
to play advantage and the Counterattack
is on options
available losing possession
here now we're inside the final 15
minutes
feeding it through and now waiting to
pounce and there's a quality defender in
action still alive well unable to direct
it on the Target and a goal kick to
[Applause]
come no lck keeping
possession well the referee allowing the
play to
flow
Adu that's clean as a whistle that
challenge can they hit on the
break the fans are shouting shoot and
both hands on it good
goalkeeping
bellinghausen careless in
possession but he's certainly not
alone took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
them oh what's he gone and
done and the flag has gone up here
offside the
decision
def
Aguero we saw the situation
developing might really be able to
trouble them
here and made sure the pass wasn't
troublesome
the referee blows for full time it ends
at a victory for the home team no
complaints from the fans here you're
absolutely right Derek their attacking
play was
excellent
one
for
their target is Crystal Clear promotion
is what they want and here they have a
chance to help their cause this the
first promotion match and they know the
opposition won't be in the mood to do
them any favors at
all stay with us we're live
[Applause]
next and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be olling my name
is Derek Ray positioned here on the
commentary Gantry and sitting next to me
ready to give you all the analysis is
Stuart Robson and excitement levels are
high as they get ready to appear in a
promotion match for the first time
Stuart what are you expecting to see
really good ball
there well last gas defending but
brilliant
[Applause]
defending and strongly to win the ball
and a foul in the opinion of the referee
now what can they do from this free kick
situation
[Applause]
has eyes for goal well it was on the
target but the keeper up to the task of
saving
it
Özil
Reed
Distributing it well that's an effective
cross aimed at the back
post well a shame that he couldn't find
the target from
there Endo with
[Applause]
it
the attack looks promising can they
Forge ahead they do and you've got to
say they're good value for the
[Applause]
lead the ball is moving once more how
important will that opening goal prove
to
be king
now
well spot on with that
[Applause]
Challenge free kick awarded then by the
[Applause]
referee well doesn't have to do it on
his own that is a tackle and a half well
play stopped it is a free
[Applause]
kick
[Applause]
well the moving is around with real
purpose here and that a piece of
goalkeeping you're going to see again
and again and
again
[Applause]
who can they pick out well not the best
clearance no spage from the goalkeeper
[Applause]
routine
superb looking
pass oh he's missed but by a minuscule
margin well he couldn't have made better
contact than that his technique is
brilliant he's so unlucky there the
owner of the green car that is blocking
up the Emer
Alex released it
nicely oh that's a super piece of
Defending really being closed down PS it
back and a goal they've increased the
lead lead and they don't want to be
throwing it away from
[Applause]
here two n now and back on
[Applause]
theway and now
King in position and a goal he's put it
away A celebratory
moment
this is looking rather comfortable for
them 3
n and now
King great ball over the
[Applause]
top oh big opportunity and that's an
excellent piece of Defending to toward
him
heril oh yes what a
pass Reed now decent looking pass oh
could be an opportunity here oh just
miss time this run and the flag going
up not the best Challenge free
[Applause]
kick well that one has promise oh might
be oh cleared away superb defending
massive
credit
really good
challenge couldn't hang on to
it delivered into the box well they
couldn't take advantage of the
opportunity really fine piece of
Defending play to Breakers
up Yoda and teammates around
her but a good piece of Defending to
bring it to an
[Applause]
end and that's going to be the
goalkeeper's
ball
[Music]
now delivering that deep
cross Corner conceded an unfussy
[Applause]
clearance over it comes that's a good
looking ball oh it's gone in a
significant deflection leaving the
keeper flish
[Applause]
alexe Reed now brilliant pass well the
keeper have plenty to think about with
bodies around
[Applause]
him and the referee has added on two
minutes of stoppage
time Reed
[Applause]
now and there it is the halim
whistle
best
so back underway and an intriguing
second half in
[Applause]
Prospect and reading it absolutely
superbly
[Applause]
the textbook
interception now the Counterattack looks
on well they need to get bodies
back and the corner has been
[Applause]
given
[Applause]
[Applause]
L to the Box appear to be in two minds
and just wide with a
[Applause]
header to win it
back is it going to be and you cannot
argue with a hattick simply Unstoppable
today goals and plentiful Supply 4-1
currently
King
Yoda
Matsui perfect tackle plenty of support
here and a confident
clearance long way out well able to
close down the
short well there's an example of how to
press high up lovely ball over the
top textbook defending Inside the
Box
the referee allowing the play to flow
that's what you call defending from the
front possibilities here I think you've
got to conclude that was good refereeing
a free kick in the end after initially
playing Advantage but it just wasn't
there well we're into the final half
hour well well if only he'd been able to
stay on side yeah you're absolutely
right stay on side and that could have
been a really big
[Applause]
chance matui nice looking pass not
smooth in
[Applause]
possession
alexe green
well there's a living breathing example
of positional sense and that'll be
[Applause]
offside deserves credit for winning the
ball
back
now delivering that deep cross and there
is the goal he's found the net Joy
[Applause]
unconfined Reed
now that's a good
ball a very effective
[Applause]
clearance well he made that interception
look routine in truth it was
free kick awarded then by the
[Applause]
referee and options in the
[Applause]
center be comfortable in bringing that
ball
down it might be on for
them it's a good looking ball could
reduce the deficit magnificent defending
oh what an astonishing goal one for the
archives remember where you were when it
happened
Unforgettable opportunity to deliver the
cross can he finish
here well just the tackle that was
needed
well he knew what he was doing
defensively with the concession of that
throw
in and she moves the ball with intent
and let's give credit to the
defending and foul it is
then
[Applause]
King well shortly we'll hear the final
whistle the home side with the lead
Stuart what have you made of this well
going forward they've been excellent but
they've also been too open at the back
they certainly haven't won this yet
released it nicely can he finish them
off he's done it what a climax to this
game
well here it is again it's an easy
finish in the end but what was the
keeper thinking that's a poor bit of
Defending couldn't keep
it this is looking threatening great
[Applause]
defending
and over it
comes well he does have a flare for the
spectacular but that wasn't a specially
spectacular yeah he just got the
technique all wrong a wasted chance
[Applause]
really
Özil well the ball goes out of play for
what'll be a goal kick
[Applause]
and taking it
[Applause]
[Applause]
away over the touch line for a throw
in well not quite what he wanted to do
with the pass could be
threatening goalkeeping of the highest
order well he's got to be pleased with
that save it's absolutely
magnificent and he's fired over the
[Music]
[Applause]
corner the referee blows for full time
it ends at a victory for the home team
no complaints from the fans here well
Derek Stewart yeah all smiles as grabs
the match ball he just had too much for
the
camera's trained on one man well he's a
good all round player when he's closing
the ball down he does it at PACE when
he's linking up the play he good at that
but his real attribute and his threat is
when he runs in behind Defenders that's
when he's said he's most
dangerous
the action is live
next and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be enrolling I'm
Derek Ray in the commentary position and
I'm joined for analysis by Stuart Robson
and it's going to be fascinating to see
how these two sides Fair as they come up
against each other what might we see
today Stuart well Derek we can talk
about coaches and their methods but it's
now down to the players which ones are
going to stand out who will affect the
game and who will have the greater
desire it should be a cracking game
though good looking
[Applause]
ball unable to trouble the defense with
that
cross
Reed moving the ball forward with
[Applause]
purpose no possibilities Inside the
Box dangerous looking through
ball and it's gone behind for the
[Applause]
corner playing it in text foot
goalkeeping following the
corner now madas could get in behind the
[Applause]
defense
Walker and the absolute mad Lads finding
space on the
[Applause]
flank
well they need to get tighter here well
didn't go to plan in the
end and does well to keep it in
[Applause]
play and a throw in Forth
coming well that shouldn't really
happened from a throw
in distributing it well and really
discomforted by the Press oh the referee
points to the sport
[Applause]
penalty well no card just a warning and
a Fair View a goal accurate from the
[Applause]
sport well as you can see the keeper
just stands still and the ball's hit
down the side of her it's a strange one
in the
end so they get the ball rolling again
and the owners is on the Mad Lads to
come up with an appropriate
response quick ball to perhaps catch
them out very comfortable piece of
[Applause]
Defending cling down
well
really good buildup but no end
[Applause]
product can he find the right pass a
fine reading of the
situation and good use of Advantage the
referee allowing play to
[Applause]
continue making sure nothing came of
it might be able to produce from this
position well he's been forced out of
play this
[Applause]
time they've lost
[Applause]
it making a bit of
Headway magnificent challenge to win it
back oh just miss time his run and the
flag going
[Applause]
up and so much space for Mad Lads out
wide and the flag has gone up offside
[Applause]
Özil Reed
[Applause]
now she's gliding
through but it Fizzles out thanks to
that piece of Defending well the referee
allowing the play to
flow now he must favor the
cross decided to come in from the
Flank In Search of space Oh that's
textbook
[Applause]
goalkeeping just failing to hit the
target with this pass and it'll be a
throw
in will the absolute mad Lads enjoying
the bulk of The Possession here but they
aren't doing enough with it they need to
pass it quicker play play forward
earlier and show more energy otherwise
they won't get back into this
one
heril not to like about that pass and
the cross not quite imaginative
enough over the touch line for a throw
in oh that's a super piece of
Defending oh good looking run let's see
about the cross didn't really work the
keeper when all was said and
done well couldn't quite find his
[Applause]
teammate
Walker
nef a good vision
there and the cross comes to
[Applause]
nothing they've given it
away doesn't want to lose as cool
here the referee is decided there will
be just one minute of added
time
well nothing for them to worry about in
the end good
defending and so it is the first half
story has been
written
okay
so into the second half it's still
doable for the Mad Lads how will they
[Applause]
Fair Reed
[Applause]
now took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
them
oh nice ball over the
top well that looked so promising but a
goal kicked the
[Applause]
outcome well the fans are going mad here
they think that was a
penalty and it's a quality
pass
and an astute piece of
Defending well he got the touch on the
ball and so a corner it'll
[Applause]
be who's going to get on the end of it
pressure on to clear as lines well given
away by the absolute madlads
and space to cross
[Applause]
it and not an attempt he'll be terribly
proud
of it's there for
[Applause]
him good looking cross thumps
clear
Reed
[Applause]
now what a commitment to defending
corner kick awarded and let's see if
this will help them add to their
lead trying to pick out a teammate not
the most confident
clearance well read to ease the
[Applause]
pressure 30 minutes left for
play
alexe
Özil and just losing control of the ball
and it will be a throw
in and just like that they've given the
ball
[Applause]
away
Walker will he play it in well he made
sure there was absolutely no way
through pressing like that will help the
cause delivering it into the
box threat over for now it
[Applause]
seems
a chance to whip it
[Applause]
in elting to cross into the center and
he wasn't messing around with the
clearance and just wide of the post yeah
decent effort but not one that was going
to trouble the goalkeeper I don't
think and Inter intercept
again
this is looking
threatening oh an incredible clearance I
must say I didn't see that coming went
in strongly
decisively 20 minutes
remaining and playing it
through and a significant block
following that cross so a deflection and
they can get ready for the corner kick
room
[Applause]
routine over it comes and clearing his
[Applause]
lines can the owner of the red car
registration B4 D Al your vehicle to
[Applause]
on
[Applause]
Reed and the cross goes
in it might still be
problematic and the flag was up in good
time it's offside well he should have
realized that was going to be offside
that's a poor decision to play that
pass
The Defenders know you can't really
allow space like
that nice ball to switch the point of
attack excellent
defending can they do something positive
on the
Counterattack need to get back quickly
here this could be it and it is he's
done it surely a case of game
over
well let's see this again this is
counterattacking football at its very
best and the movement is good making for
a comfortable finish it's a really great
goal disappointing
[Applause]
pass and he has options
available he'll be breathing a sigh of
relief ball
one
[Applause]
that's a good
ball
Özil well these fans are demanding much
more here they have to start winning the
ball back quicker at the moment they're
too easy to play
against
[Applause]
on the cross didn't beat the first man
and it's gone behind for the
[Applause]
corner let's see about the
delivery and clearing her
[Applause]
lines trying to open up the defense he
just needs to stay levelheaded
now and there it is that will put the
seal on Victory if there were any
lingering
[Applause]
doubts this is looking rather
comfortable for them 3
n now doesn't get away with it free kick
given
[Applause]
a de
clearance and so the final whistle here
the visitors come out on top
Stewart
f
en
all eyes on one man well Derek we know
he's got great Pace whether he's running
with the ball or running in behind
Defenders and that's what makes him such
a threat on the Counterattack and I'm
sure that's going to be the tactics
today from his
team all the action is next live on EA
TV and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe this will be enrolling I'm
Derek Ray your match commentator and
alongside providing all the Tactical
analysis it's Stuart Robson and it's
going to be fascinating to see how these
two sides fa as they come up against
each other Stuart your expectations well
thanks Derek as always the scene is set
two good teams a great playing surface
and a vibrant atmosphere has all the
ingredients for a really exciting
[Applause]
game it did look on for them but not to
be
alexe decent looking pass
genuine chance able to get his body in
the
way nicely cut
[Applause]
[Applause]
out
Shake Bean
well showing good patience now will the
cross work out for them No Nonsense
[Applause]
clearance
[Applause]
heril
alexe in a position from which they
could potentially do a bit of damage
here well it came to nothing in the
end and playing it
through can he get them the lead not all
that convincing
defensively well it came to nothing in
the
end
good Vision can he get onto
this appear to be in two
minds well they know they need to stop
[Applause]
him letting to cross into the center a
disappointing effort making the Keeper's
life a bit too
easy theer of the Brant
pass he be breathing a sigh of relief
ball one well clattered
[Applause]
away and in with a real chance oh Stella
defensive work to get back and win
possession could play it
in terrific
block and the referee says corner
[Applause]
kick played over well nothing comes of
it
wero now in potentially a dangerous
position must take the lead here and
they have you've got to say it has been
coming so the ball rolling again with
the score line standing at 1
nil can he find the
net
[Applause]
and across the touch line so a throw in
here Jin
Shake now he must favor the
[Applause]
cross and that puts them in
position really fine piece of Defending
play to break us
up
Advantage
[Applause]
played wonderfully weighted pass a good
defending clattered out of
there and well positioned to
[Applause]
clear Özil
now getting close to the halime break
and the visitors find themselves behind
Stuart what have you made of this well
I've been a little disappointed with
their attacking play it's all been a bit
too slow if they can pass into their
front areas with more quality switch
play quicker and be more positive in One
V one situations I think they'll get
back into
[Applause]
this went in strongly decisively
and options in the
center is it going to be an
[Applause]
opportunity a chance then for the
respective managers to address their
[Applause]
charges
we
so back underway here into the second
[Applause]
half well Foul Play says the
[Applause]
referee
[Applause]
a good Vision there and you don't want
to lose possession there well the danger
is still
[Applause]
there promising
pass determined
defending
Bean chance to
cross a fine
block and deflected behind so a corner
here who's going to get on the end of it
just the clearance that was
needed oh that's a super piece of
Defending well chance perhaps and that a
piece of goalkeeping you're going to see
again and again and
[Applause]
again let's see about the delivery no
keeper will mind that sort of
corner
[Applause]
alexe giving the ball
[Applause]
away lot to like about that pass and
he's got and score to level it
again well just look at this he's so
alive to the situation that's a neat
headed goal in the end so the ball is
rolling again at one all that's a good
looking ball and both hands on it good
goalkeeping really good interception
[Applause]
30 minutes left for
[Applause]
play bean might be able to produce from
this
position
[Applause]
peric
nicely Ed
tackle
Bean well possibilities in the
center and making sure there was no
danger in the end and that is going to
be a free
kick
well the keeper was hoping someone might
get on the end of it but it will be a
throwi
in
Shake
Jin good
distribution Wanderers couldn't hang on
to
[Applause]
it options in the
center in position here to protect the
ball that's not a bad ball just the
clearance that was called
for well just listen to these fans
they're urging their team to score here
and take the
lead favoring the short
[Applause]
one
just have to make sure they don't get
caught on the
Counterattack now they have possession
in a good area of the pitch off the post
and back in Play No Nonsense
clearance well you sense the goals
coming they're getting so close now they
just need to take one of these chances
well having been denied by the woodwork
now the focus is on keeping the
opposition it
be trying to Chisel a chance out of it
Splendid
[Applause]
defending in a decent position
now and they're on the front foot
looking for a winner near the end of
this game and cleared away a corner kick
it'll
be
can someone get on the end of this well
another Corner following on from the
last
[Applause]
one now he must get it out of
there 10 minutes to go
then and the conditions look pretty good
for the
Counterattack must score and she's kept
it
out well you just never know about
chances near the end you've got to be
opportunistic will this corner do
[Applause]
it let's see about the delivery well it
would have delighted the fans had it
gone
[Applause]
in and there to intervene and a goal at
this stage could be decisive and the
cross not quite accurate enough
can they get in behind them can she
steer it out of
there well no damage
done good looking move this and his
teammate got him out of
trouble and the emphasis is on
creativity
but the danger averted for
now well wanders have certainly
controlled the ball over the last 15
minutes as you can see and have got the
ball into some really good positions you
just feel it's only a matter of time
before they get their
goal yes it's so true for once they find
themselves in defensive mode the danger
is still
there well I don't think that effort
remotely qualifies as respectable and
the reason it's of Target because the
technique was really poor on that
occasion that's not a good
[Applause]
effort promising pass tension building
still Level and a decent delivery and a
goal this is why we adore this game late
drama and now the and that is the end of
the contest and not a happy outcome as
[Applause]
far by one goal but I never
l
[Music]
we
