Gamers happy New Year's to everyone I
hope you guys have a wonderful
20124 and I got a little treat for you
I'm streaming on December 31st so this
is still 2023 for us we're casting the
lowest rated player off
2023 coming in strong this is like the
the lowest legit player we found coming
in strong at
41,600 win rate and about 150 games we
got envious fiend let's get into it now
this game spoilers does last a bit so we
cannot uh you know I'm not going to play
it times one
so classic five villagers in the house
love that now this is not on Xbox so
someone in my chat said is this an Xbox
gamer no it's not we checked because
there's ranked ladder for Xbox rank lad
for PC this is PC now on the other side
his opponent is going to be S or I'm
going to call him
PC cuz that's easier and that's first
two letters of his name
so PC is going to be playing as the
purple English and envious fiend is
going to be playing as the pink French
the matchup of the old ages now
what do we see we see two Scouts from
Pink So pink is okay he's kind of
playing games over here not producing a
lot of villagers uh he actually still
has six
villagers um but he does have two Scouts
so there's that on the other side we see
a clutch forestry opening coming in from
PC so he is going with
um four what is this four on food four
four on wood and three on gold one of my
favorite builds and envious is about to
age up hold up he's got enough but is he
going to age up we're going to find out
soon he's probably microing his Scouts
and to be fair he got a lot of sheep uh
PC is not going to be having any sh oh
God he's following his Scout as well
that is not a good one he's just he's
just look at his vision he is just
scouting everything he's going
everywhere and he has 19 sheep right
now O Beautiful Farms right there love
that school of Cavalry right here in the
back wants you to keep it safe with five
and then he's going to start producing
villagers now so envious fiend I'm
assuming what he's doing is he thinks
that if he doesn't make villagers he'll
age up
quicker that's the only thing I can
think of cuz now he queued up a bunch of
villagers so I think his logic is if I
don't make villagers I can age up faster
which considering he's aging up in six
minutes that is not the case
right Scout running through he even
garrisons okay almost gets that on the
other side the forestry build is working
out amazing councel hole also in the
back he's going to get some Stone now he
is scouting look at this he's scouting
the last piece of the map I mean he just
scouted everything look at this guy he's
active with his Scouts love
that
so we got a lot of workers or sheep he
is producing a lot of workers now one on
gold is there going to be a knight or
something we've yet to see 7 Minutes
beautiful Farms I'm guessing the next
Farm is going to be here
that's just a guess the next Farm goes
here maybe
not no villager production for purple
and now envious is taking over in the
villagers he has queued out bajillion
and he is is pulling through right now
he's basically winning uh oh there's the
next Farm I called it and that's and
that's why I'm a player right there cuz
I'm able to call these beautiful things
we see specialized pick coming in high
we see blacksmith we see another Archer
range we see long bows getting produced
these guys are playing at the top of
their game right now these guys are top
of the crop and you can see it right
here I love this build the one on stone
three on gold 600 gold uh love that
everything that I'm seeing perfect gamep
play so
far is this what I think it is if you
think it's plastic League legends that
is correct our pink boy is the lowest
rer player right
now okay we see Horsemen Knight Horsemen
Knight
Horsemen I like that I like that he's
mixing it
up we see another Farm PC does not know
that Mill increases the farm Gathering
rate for English it seems it's okay and
okay that's five head right
here he is going for plus one melee
attack and his
villagers are ranged and his only two
production buildings are
ranged now that's a five
head that's a five head right there
these guys are making me think right now
he's going for plus one plus one plus
one melee armor and he's going Siege
engineering is this going to be a man-
at- arm transition we don't
know this this might be the best game of
the year I think so too I think so too
this is some high level stuff or should
I say this is some high
stuff o he's had enough of the sheep he
says
okay I no way he's going pro Scouts
first oh I got to see that oh I gotta
see
that Pro Scout first right here this is
the this is the world first bronze
League Pro Scout these guys are bronze
one and I I have never seen this in my
life I'm about to learn something new I
thought he's had enough with the Sheep
but no he just rushed that Mill cuz he
wanted Pro Scouts
immediately he noticed that he's going
to run out of food in about 15 minutes
so he needed to rush that out Pro Scouts
completed no
way it's not a
misclick
no and he drops it far away from yo no
way dude look at
that
wow okay we see some high gameplay over
here from envious fiend the other Scout
is a bit AFK I wish he had him with we
do see another two Stables with 14
workers he needs that ASAP you know like
he cannot wait he needs that right now
and he makes it right now on the other
side the White Tower as you do in bronze
the White Tower is the most OP thing in
the game we see more Archer Rangers we
see English trade coming out hold
up this is an interesting
Mill
uh what what why did he make a mill
there okay trade coming insane trade
boom 19 gold per trip more Farms are
coming Tower comes up there's a lot of
Horsemen and knights what else do we see
Pro Scouts are still going at it this
guy is insane right now how long can he
Pro Scout for that's the
question he can age up he's getting that
stone he's got enough gold to age up
he's got the Eco upgrades English is not
getting uh the
upgrades and what is the plan for these
guys
what a back and forth game we're seeing
so far what a back and forth game I mean
these guys are just the timings are
working out perfectly okay he he gets
all the stone and then he goes back to
Wood what is the stone for oh shoots the
wolf a little
bit okay drops off a bunch of wood no
age up yet from envas he's busy Pro
scouting taking a lot of is APM okay is
he going to get the last deer yeah what
a what a Play What a play I'm loving
that English uh getting a monastery he's
going to get some relics maybe quad five
Archer ranges actually with Cel
Hall and
um so far A little bit Calm before the
storm if you will and now we see four
barracks
transition and he's going Spearman okay
against English I love that and he's Pro
scouting still dude who is this
guy who is this guy he's getting all the
gold in the world we see network of
citadels right now being
researched he ran out of food and he
said you know what [ __ ] it I'm just
going to mine gold with I'm just going
to mine gold with 38
workers as you do he gets that where is
he going he's going to go for stone okay
now he's going with the pull the boys on
the resources build where he's just
going to mine every resources on the map
every resource on the map with all 38
workers builds another mining camp look
at that value he's getting right now
okay meanwhile PC he's securing the
relics he's making Rams he is cooking
right now he's getting prepared that
stone has got no chance against him
envious envious mows down that stone
like nobody's business and that stone
goes down beautiful game play and he's
going to go for the gold next he sees
the next Target and it is going to be
this gold triple mining camp coming in
the villagers are getting a really good
surround on this gold Vin and the
villagers are going to town and I'm not
sure if this gold Vin can hold right now
it is getting absolutely demolished I
mean it's already under 3.4k Health
right now and there's a next mining camp
being prepared I mean the transition
from Envia through the roof right now
this guy knows what's up on the other
side PC he's making some Rams he's
getting some Stone but he's not doing
the quality mining that we see here from
envas this the gold is under 2.5k almost
at 50% HP what is PC going to do about
this is he going to respond there a
traish coming to take down those pesky
mining camps but under 2K gold is going
down and PC is just not moving his army
he just not protecting at all that gold
that Gold's under one point .5k it's
going down 37 villagers on it right now
the Villager production restarts from
envs under 1K and if this goes down I
think PC is going to be in a lot of
trouble right here if this goes down
that's not going to be and he's just
he's just not moving he just doesn't
know he doesn't see it 500 it's the gold
wi is burning right now it's going out
300 HP 200 hp 100 it explodes and the
gold vein goes down wow just like
that but he is not
done he is not
done he wants
more he needs more it's not that he
wants he needs more he's a gold man okay
he's going to make okay delete some
mining is that going to be a little wall
here no way
Stonewall Tower okay little upgrade
Maybe
beautiful play right now I'm literally
having chills watching these guys
perform right here these two artists
some would say 7,200 gold right now
3,000 Stone birkshire is coming up where
is it coming up love that in the back of
the base protecting the deer love
that okay English is coming oh Lord he
coming the tret gets it down the
villagers are going down would see what
does envious do zero food per minute
he's still Pro scouting and the Spearman
transition I mean the Spearman
transition might just end this game
completely I think Spearman transition
is going to catch PC completely off
guard I think he has no idea that it's
coming and I think that we're about to
see an epic battle right
here oh my God the beautiful surround
the Spearman are coming in they're hard
right now they're going in one ram goes
down two Rams are about to go three Rams
four Rams go down wow but more Rams are
coming these guys top of the crop right
now PC reaches Imperial envs has enough
food for Castle but he says uh-uh I
don't need
that and the engagement comes through
the uh what do they call pinks come
through but EnV is just Ms down that
engagement kills the Trish as well wow
and just like that he turned turns this
game upside down and it's not looking
good for PC if you guys are a PC fan
this is not looking good for him right
now okay he's getting some wood are we
going to shattering projectiles Rush
coming out three relics right
here as well the trade boom is
continuing oh my God the value Camp is
coming out no
way that is nuts right now
more houses three relics still
chilling what is PC's plan he's in a lot
of
trouble he's in a lot of
trouble let's see what is envious doing
right now what is his
plan so far he's just he's just chilling
I think he might have taken like a
bathroom break or something maybe went
to take a a [ __ ] cuz he's been gone a
while so I think maybe that's like I
think maybe like an explosive diarrhea
happened or something because we don't
see anything in production
oh he's back he wiped washed his hands
and adds three Stables after deleting a
mining camp right there okay six Archer
ranges coming out and oh he's going for
the six six
six which means that envious worships
the devil and he's going to go for the
five houses is there going to be a sixth
house that's what I want to know no just
five and another
five with 29
workers and now we go for mil okay I
love that love that build that he just
did there that transition very clean
very smooth and we do see an age up and
we do see a hidden age up with seven
words ERS I'm loving what I'm seeing
right now envious is playing out of his
mind the four monks over here are just
chilling with the relics in their hands
we do see a mill coming out that's going
to be for them berries wow this game has
been such a treat right
here more Rams are coming Guild hole
completes we do see a trade Boom coming
out oh my God what is that 18 gold per
trip
oh no oh no villager you got to run he
pulls back the villagers there's a wall
of
law okay he's not going to wall yet he
hasn't even put these relics maybe he
thinks he just needs to hold relics in
his
hand maybe does know he needs to put
them here I'm not sure the the mon comes
back I mean he's still not doing
anything about
it and what do we see we see nothing in
production from envas oh but the
villagers are Under Fire and oh that's a
lot of long bow right there brother they
do have plus one weapon but they have
incendiary arrows he put Guild hole on
wood that's an interesting choice cuz he
has no wood that makes sense the
villagers are running back maybe should
make some more villagers the units are
moving around and he says you know what
I need some of that man at arms and
Spearman he's also queuing up some
stable units are we going to see Archer
oh my God he's skewing up archers as
well but
a he's out of
food he is out of food right now we see
Zero villagers on food and we see 22 on
wood and that's pretty much it that's
that's all his villagers trade boom is
going strong with that 18 gold per
minute or per trade and wow what a
banger of a game this has
been 10,000 gold in the bank
he's producing a lot of units right here
that's a lot of units no blacksmith
upgrades for envious he doesn't need
those he
says this is about to be a big
engagement he did not upgrade veteran
for any of his units did he upgrade for
Spearman no they're still hard and oh
engagement comes in here hold
up
engage okay yo get a good surround right
here archers doing work Palisade or
whatever they're called palings coming
down but that's going to be a clean up
and
envious you know fighting out of that
last rank spot in the world showing
dominance two epic engagements for him
as stable goes down but wow he takes
that fight and he destroys
PC wow but more RS are coming hold
up more Rams are coming more bombard
Towers everywhere five more just sitting
there and wow what a crazy game so
far is he going to repair this
table I'm going to assume that oh my god
I didn't even see that thanks sweet chat
10,700 food for PC he doesn't even have
that Village that many villagers on food
he's got 23 but he's just
not not producing much you know uh what
do we see we see no production right now
from envious is he going to make some
Farms or
something I don't see anything
yet his Guild hole went
down and he is cooking something
guaranteed I guarantee he's just waiting
to do something he's about to pull a
rabbit out of his hat and dominate this
game boiling oil is coming he's going to
repair that guil
hole
still on that wood but he's got no
food oh beautiful harassment right here
catches them villagers and now he's only
half the workers from the opponent if he
does that about six seven more times
he's going to equalize the worker count
but not the food count
though okay let's see he's got more
army the White Tower is pumping oh God
oh God oh God the units are getting
wrecked but he gets the trape hold up
the trishe goes down the Rams are coming
in strong right now and what a game this
has been what a what a treat you know
what I
mean he sees him he sees him he's going
for it 34 long bows versus a bit of
everything okay Rams taking some of the
charges but the units are coming in he
activates the ability I think he AC yeah
he activated the arrow volley ability
he's using the uh the palings again
which I never can remember the name and
wow what an epic engagement he's Target
firing the crossbows out of all things
why not and is EnV is going to be able
to take this fight I mean what an epic
engagement it's going to be really close
it's going to be really close and PC
runs away because he knows he's got the
Rams cooking over here destroying
everything right now and wow what a
fight that was the villagers are
chopping wood long distance gold being
long distance mine this game is chaos
right now the the both players are you
know they they're running on over 17 APM
right now they're looking everywhere
they can't pay attention so there's some
mistakes you know these guys usually
play you know close to perfect but you
can see some mistakes he definitely
thinks that monks generate Goldie for
just holding the relics and not putting
them anywhere and the Rams are just
ramming and envious is struggling right
now he's got no food but he says you
know what I got no food but I got I got
[ __ ] wood and gold [ __ ] I'm going to
make some Siege and I hope he does cuz
he he has no nothing he has an Archer
and two Scouts and that's
it wow re balquin coming out beautiful
transition right there the TC is the
next
Target he's going to be making some
Siege no Barracks no Archer ranges left
he's repairing he's trying to hold
on we see PC putting a lot of pressure
to scout is going to go down been AFK
the whole game there wow mining C comes
in some more longdistance wood chopping
beautiful uh beautiful gameplay right
there he repairs that TC and he says you
know
what I could use some food and he goes
for the deer and is he still Pro no way
this man is not this man is not pro
scouting 48 minutes into the game with
one
Scout no
way no way
dude yeah they're they're still holding
relics they're
chilling I mean listen I I'm a bit of a
pro player and I don't have the APM to
to proc Scout 48 minutes into the game
but this guy he's doing it let me tell
you and not only he's doing it he's
doing it with style look at that he's
going to go for another one dude he's
about to shoot that boore and carry it
over to Toc as well I guarantee
you and we have a bit of a pause while
the players gather up their armies
although NBS has zero Army he well he
has an Archer and a scout
out we see Rams coming a lot of rebal
quins and uh well I wonder if envious
can hold this this is going to be a big
push he's making Stables
again um and Archer ranges okay so he's
doing the 666 again the push is coming
envious you need some units R you got to
make
something the villagers go down and he
says I can't hold that and that's a sign
of a great player he knows when the game
is over he doesn't delay the game you
know what I mean he just knows you know
you pushed me to my limit there was
nothing I could have done there I ran
out of resources I was on like 9,000
gold or something and uh there's nothing
I could have done there so beautiful
play by both players but PC does take
that one and uh
wow envious you know better luck next
time I'm sure he's going to get him but
what a game that was wow and that is the
lowest rated gamer in
2023 that's right 2023 is done we have
