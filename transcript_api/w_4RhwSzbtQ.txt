there's more tension in the air than
usual and you can understand why if they
get the victory today they'll be assured
of a place in the promotion match and
that is nothing to be sniffed
[Applause]
at
will it happen live on EA
TV good evening and welcome ahead of
what should be a pulsating night of
football I'm Derek Ray and ready with
his tactics board alongside me is Stuart
Robson my commentary partner and the
hope is they'll be able to move on from
here to a promotion match Place Stuart
what are your expectations for today
well Derek I think this will be tense
but they know a good performance and a
victory will give them access to a
promotion match it should be an
interesting
[Applause]
game
Jong and in the right position to make
sure it didn't go all the way
[Applause]
through
and fed
forward but he knew he had to get to the
ball and he
[Applause]
did and a wonderful diving save to deny
the
[Applause]
opportunity
and over it comes and that is a Defender
doing his job clearing us off the
line
Palmer H
[Applause]
up
Quinn Palmer with
it and nothing comes of this
[Applause]
attack and nicely over the
top he CS it back
and making sure there was no danger in
the
end back with
Ramos
Palmer
[Applause]
Quinn well they couldn't keep hold of
[Applause]
it
Tong gido and passing it
[Applause]
through strength and control a big part
of his
[Applause]
game Ramos with
[Applause]
it
hmer
took a really smart piece of Defending
to stop
[Applause]
them well Time
[Applause]
Tackle and the rolling is offs side
here
Palmer with
it super tackle and they've won
possession now who can she play it
to can she score what a commitment to
defending
[Applause]
Quinn Palmer plenty of options that's a
good ball losing possession
here
[Applause]
Jong they'll be happy to have regained
possession
Palmer must take the lead here and they
have you've got to say it has been
[Applause]
coming and back onway one nil it
is
Jong and he saw the situation
developing H
up spraying passes around almost waiting
for the opposition to make a
mistake here's
Ramos well getting close to the halftime
interval and the story so far are not
really making Home Advantage count
Stuart your take well it's been a tight
first half so far but they haven't quite
shown enough gu in the attacking third
if however they can be more dynamic in
the 1 V1 situations they have the
quality to turn this
[Applause]
around and very deathly cut
out really good ball
there and effectively parried Away by
The
Keeper now an opportunity from the
corner to get right back into this
one well they draw a level here the
crowd certainly think
[Applause]
so over it
comes the header needed to be a lot
better than that didn't really make the
keeper
[Music]
work back with
Ramos nice looking
pass
and that's a
[Applause]
corner trying to pick out a
teammate and there it is the halime
whistle
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
w
[Applause]
so the two teams have switched around
and the second half is
[Applause]
underway
[Applause]
[Applause]
timely
[Applause]
intervention
Ramos
[Applause]
now could be a chance to break
here well disappointing end to the
[Applause]
move
[Applause]
Gedo oh she's gliding through a smart
stop
here emphasis on the clearance a good
one can he finish well I think it's fair
to say he got underneath that just a
little
[Applause]
bit they couldn't maintain
possession she has team teammates around
[Applause]
her real
chance it's in they're looking really
relaxed and confident and not giving the
opposition much of a look
in well as you can see his movement is
really good which then makes the Finish
look easy that's a decent goal that's
for
sure so 2-0 now
incisive
pass it was caught nicely enough but the
fact of the matter is it wasn't on
[Applause]
target that's very effective good high
pressing Gedo well they have the ball
once more
[Applause]
Quinn Ramos well they're a bit like a
passing machine and you can understand
why they want to play it that way in
front as they are and very nicely
positioned to win it
back Gedo trying to open up the defense
well he's been ruled
offside
Ramos with
it
[Applause]
Palmer H
[Applause]
up Ramos
now good ball over the top a very
effective
clearance
20 minutes to go in this
one and in the right position to read
[Applause]
[Music]
it that's a high quality
pass really committed defending car
please return to your vehicle are on
[Applause]
terrific block
there can they create something from
here the delivery and the danger still
on well nothing comes of it
[Applause]
superb looking
[Applause]
pass well this one help them get back
into the game Splendid
defending well maybe a good position
from which to
[Applause]
counter 10 minutes to go
then so the final whistle almost upon us
and this is not exactly what the home
fans had in mind when they arrived at
the ground today Stuart well they've
been second best that's for sure and the
main problem has been in Midfield where
they've been overrun at times they just
haven't been able to get enough
possession it's not been a good
performance
today now does she mean
[Applause]
business team team mates
available but a good piece of Defending
to bring it to an end what was the
chance they could get caught out on the
break
[Applause]
here well he's won the
ball
Jong
and possession lost
[Applause]
there
H and the electronic Bo showing one
additional
minute
Higgins will he play it
[Music]
in oh he looks
[Applause]
threatening
and there goes the final whistle much to
the disappointment of their
[Applause]
supporters
the prize today is considerable win the
game and make it through to the
promotion match a big test of every
player's
character
[Applause]

the cross and a confident
[Applause]
clearance
oh lovely weighted ball they might be
[Applause]
in
etto well cleared
[Applause]
away
played over well the header was
respectable but the goalkeeper always
seemed to have it
[Applause]
covered Ibrahimovic chance to
cross able to clear the danger at least
for
now
[Music]
plenty of
[Applause]
options Reed
now well the ball goes out of play for
what'll be a goal
kick oh goodness what's the keeper
[Applause]
doing
[Applause]
he's protecting it
effectively poor pass under no real
pressure it's with
[Applause]
g
now relying very much on their passing
game in a bid to take the lead and fist
it away in a decent position
now who can he pick
out oh the threat is there insufficient
guile on the crossing front you've got
to
[Applause]
say
[Applause]
well they have the advantage that's good
refereeing not made it look routine but
read it
[Applause]
well Reed
now good through ball oh that's a really
good
pass
oh great
defending and not cleared away
properly threat over for now it
[Applause]
seems went in strongly
decisively
Tong
Reed and offside
unfortunately it's with
G
[Applause]
Hugh effective looking pass
rakitic and the referee sensibly
allowing them to carry on Advantage with
them a very effective play in
possession plays it back oh that's a
fine looking pass well what a stop it
was well I have to say that's a
magnificent save that's a top class
piece of
goalkeeping so the corner played into
the box and he clears the danger
and the conditions look pretty good for
the
Counterattack must take the lead
here well body in the
way it's a perfect
challenge well that's a super ball over
the top oh and she's through here oh my
goodness such a classy goal well that's
one to take your breath away a volley
par excellence and no wonder she's
[Applause]
celebrating well the ball is moving once
more how important will that opening
goal prove to
be
Pew rakitic struggling to keep the
ball
one minutes of stoppage time has been
added
[Applause]
on it needs an accurate
cross chance to finish and the Keeper's
technical skill s there for all to see
well from that close in that's a really
good save such good
[Applause]
reflexes delivering
[Applause]
it that is that for the first half
[Applause]
here
we
[Applause]
so back underway and an intriguing
second half in
[Applause]
Prospect
now do they mean business on this
[Applause]
occasion
Jong and space to cross
[Applause]
it oh great block they won't complain
about having won the corner and maybe an
opportunity to increase their
advantage
[Applause]
trying to deliver it accurately oh a
really good header but the goalkeeper
there's a cover
[Applause]
up oh what a clearance Under Pressure
had to react and
did and the referee takes exception to
the Challenge free kick
[Applause]
well read to win possession
[Applause]
back Reed now what a magnificent
pass oh dealt with by the goalkeeper
pretty comfortable piece of
Defending that's not a bad ball and a No
Nonsense
[Applause]
clearance he ped the attack illegally
now perhaps a card is
[Applause]
forthcoming
[Applause]
excellent strike couldn't get it past
that human
barrier really good challenge now who
can she pick
out will it be crucial intervention just
then amid impending
Danger
[Applause]
trying to pick out a
teammate in a decent position
[Applause]
now now can she pick out a
teammate might be
[Applause]
dangerous
can she score well somehow the
goalkeeper got to
it let's see about the
delivery and clears the
danger pressure applied can they make
something of
it
[Applause]
that's what you call defending from the
front possibilities here what a vital
intervention well far from a smooth
challenge now will the referee produce a
[Applause]
card good strength to keep the
ball
Jong the owner of silver hatch with the
registra Cavani 21
LJ please contact your nearest security
guard thank you accurate pass upon
accurate
pass good through
ball in behind for him to
chase well a corner kick it is let's see
if they can put this to good use as they
try to add to
[Applause]
Advantage delivering it well it was
caught nicely enough but the fact of the
matter is it wasn't on
Target and into the last 20
minutes well he's given it away
an attack full of
Promise chance to
[Applause]
cross well making considerable progress
with the ball well the danger is still
there and no problems at all for the
keeper
Jong
that's a good pass but how well he did
to react in that manner and Beyond the
last Defender
offside and it's opening up and they've
done it to square the game once again
exhilerating
well just look how he holds off the
defender he keeps his balance and he
still hits the target what a good goal
that is
Cavani
[Applause]
GRE well it was a foul but good use of
Advantage by the referee and that puts
them in
[Applause]
positionto well that takes the wind out
of their sails great
defending pew
well they're certainly thinking about a
[Applause]
winner looking for a teammate and
keeping it
[Applause]
out well there's an example of how to
press high up good looking move spot on
with that
tackle
and just five minutes
remaining well time is running out to
get this winner but the fans certainly
believe it's coming just listen to the
noise what a fantastic finish we could
have
here oh he looks threatening he must
finish oh a superb
save well the two sides still locked
together and a set piece a corner can
make all the
difference and over it comes
oh you've just witnessed goal scoring
Perfection Flawless technique out of
this world
[Applause]
incredible so the ball is running again
2 one the score
line Reed now
they've got to be really mindful of the
time situation attacking though they
might
be over the touch line for a throw
in
Reed spot on with that
challenge and just flicked off the
defender so a corner coming
[Applause]
up
corner kick played in what late
excitement and the match is
[Applause]
level well here you can see it again
it's a superb cross just asking for
someone to go and meet it and it ends up
with a fairly simple finish certainly
not much the goalkeeper can do about
that
and it's level again here both sets of
fans being put through something of an
emotional
mangle and there is the referee's
whistle for full time even Steven here
they can't
be
that's
everyone here on tenter hooks and you
can understand why if they draw this
game or better they'll make it through
to the promotion match and that would be
a real cause for
celebration
stay with us on eatv for the live action
as it
happens and welcome to a game that
really should have pulsers racing every
reason to believe this will be olling
I'm your match commentator Derek Ray and
ready to provide expert analysis
alongside me is Stuart Robson and if all
goes to a plan they can progress to a
promotion match Stuart what are your
expectations for today well I think
Derek this will be tent but they know a
good performance here and a draw at
least will give them access to promotion
match it should be an interesting
game
rakitic keeping it on the ground
slightly off Target
[Applause]
however
giving the ball
away chance here crucial intervention
just then amid impending
[Applause]
danger plenty of support
here well really fine goalkeeping good
diving
[Applause]
stop
[Applause]
[Applause]
clearance wasn't
decisive cell on the
ball re
now Campbell with
it
Jong greed and an effect of
clearance well that's really strong play
to keep hold of the
[Applause]
ball and giving it away
beautiful
pass and an attempt best forgotten I
[Applause]
[Applause]
think and quick thinking
defensively
R to roam on the
wing must take the lead here oh so near
off the
post good waight on that pass real
chance terrific piece of
anticipation well there's an example of
how to press high up
[Applause]
ESO and the defensive intervention
[Applause]
thereo and it might be and there's a
quality Defender and action
and really discomforted by the press the
pressure was high and they could be in
[Applause]
here putting all their energies into
winning back
possession what to like about that
[Applause]
pass
really clever pressing terrific
[Applause]
save and the danger is a
it well the keeper made a good save but
you just sense a goal is coming soon
well maybe a chance for them now to
alleviate the pressure good
tackle
Cavani
[Music]
[Applause]
take it
away
cbell and playing it
through pivotal moment defensively
[Applause]
seemingly cannot keep hold of the ball
here options in the
center that's a lovely
[Applause]
ball oh nice ball over the top to chase
well there is the opening goal the
pressure finally telling and they get
their two
reward well just look at the defending
here they just don't read the danger
it's a poor goal to
[Applause]
conceed so the ball rolling again with
the score line standing at 1 n a
tremendous
[Applause]
Vision he's blocked it well they might
be trailing but hope in the form of a
[Applause]
corner and over it comes did well to
clear it away now perhaps they can
counter from
[Applause]
here Defenders need to cover well
unfortunately it fizzled out in the end
and cly D despite the mounting
[Applause]
pressure
vtic well it's a good-looking position
is there a goal in the
future but it Fizzles out thanks to that
piece of
Defending Reed
[Applause]
now and the electronic board showing one
additional
minute Reed now and the whistle is
sounded for halime in this
game
[Applause]
like
so back underway and an intriguing
second half in
[Applause]
Prospect now what can they do from here
[Applause]
here well it came to nothing in the
[Applause]
end can she put it away and the goal to
increase their advantage to two overall
that little bit of a cushion now it's
all about keeping the
concentration well here you can see it
again good run great strength and a
composed finish Under Pressure that's a
top class
goal possession
[Applause]
lost
fre great ball over the top just
straying
[Applause]
offside
good
movement and let's give credit to the
defending
Reed
[Applause]
etto and the fine
tackle
ESO
Ibrahimovic good looking buildup as they
try to reduce the aers can he get one
back he can he's given his team a real
opportunity and momentum is with
themo
so a half an hour
remaining nice waight on the pass and
the flag raised offside it
[Applause]
is
[Applause]
rakitic
makes the move to the
inside Couldn't keep
it oh breezing past him oh and it goes
now they're level who saw this coming
incredible so underway again and it's a
story of par two goals a piece in this
one
[Applause]
must take the lead
here that's a well struck
pass there's the cut back I quality
defending and they'll get ready for the
throw
in good challenge and a throw incoming
up good
defending now the outcome as a free kick
here rakitic chance
here not out of the woods
[Applause]
yet well threat silver for
now well they've lost possession of the
[Applause]
ball and the emphasis is on
creativity must
be it's got to be and a goal just like
that they're back in
front what a big moment in the dying
Embers will it Pro decisive
here
rakitic and we're inside the final 15
[Applause]
minutes un tidy in
[Applause]
possession and the ball in behind the
Defenders and there it is two goals in a
matter of minutes incredible
stuff promising
pass options at the back post here what
a genuine opportunity but it was
squandered go
kick Campbell on the
ball
Cavani and a throw in Forth coming
[Applause]
Reed now oh yes what a
pass and a confident
[Music]
[Applause]
clearance Crossing
opportunity this looks interesting well
no problems
defensively
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
Campbell
[Applause]
GRE room to maneuver on the wing well
nothing comes of it it looked
promising
Ibrahimovic
Pew who can he pick
[Applause]
out dealt with that ball
comfortably it certainly wasn't a clean
tackle and the referee has got to book
him I
[Applause]
think
Reed well taking into account all the
stoppages 2 minutes to be added on this
could be dangerous if he's not
careful smuggled
[Applause]
away that's a lovely
ball took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
them the referee blows for full time it
ends at a victory for the
home better individ ual and we're always
a threat going forward it was a really
good performance and a good result as
well
all
there can be no denying it this is
crunch time the first promotion match
and no margin for error the players have
simply got to get it right out there on
the
[Applause]
Pitch live coverage right here on E a
TV one of the great things about
football is that no one knows for sure
what's going to happen let's see what
unfolds here tonight my name is Derek
Ray and joining me for commentary is
Stuart Robson and today it's their first
promotion match in this division how do
you see the match going Stuart well I've
enjoyed watching them up to this point
but today will be tough that's for sure
they'll need to be at their very best to
win here I
[Applause]
think
Bustamante
matuda what to like about that
pass the save was a good
[Applause]
one
C really getting stuck in
[Applause]
defensively and it cross the touch line
so a throw in
[Applause]
here contante now who can he play it to
oh tremendous
Vision High pressing and good high
[Applause]
pressing Reed
now in the right place to cut out the
pass
Reed Reed
now giving the ball away not the best
Challenge free
[Applause]
kick
Cavani R it superbly to take back
possession difficult to stop him now
will the cross work out for them was an
important piece of
Defending cleared away but at the
expense of a
corner please return to your vehicle
immediately thank you trying to deliver
it
accurately
[Applause]
oh nice ball over the
top oh he's blocked
it intercepting it
[Applause]
intelligently oh it's so well to deny
him
let's see about the delivery and off
Target by Miles with that one and a goal
kick will
[Applause]
ensue
Cavani
ESO well it looked highly promising but
they got nothing out of
it
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
really getting stuck
in decent looking
pass well the visitors have had most of
the ball in the last 15 minutes and
they're playing really well and creating
chances it's surely only a matter of
time before they take the lead
here the referee spotted the little Nick
on the way through so a throw in coming
up Reed
now and possession changing
hands moving it
Forward good use of
advantage the fact of the matter is
sometimes there is no advantage and that
was the view of the
referee very alert defending to cut off
the
[Applause]
supply
[Applause]
[Applause]
contante
well there's a living breathing example
of positional
[Applause]
sense chance to
cross and now they have the ball
back
[Applause]
and the referee takes exception to the
Challenge free
[Applause]
kick and both hands on it good
goalkeeping
well Time
Tackle there will be one minute added on
at the
end will he play it in could still be
dangerous the first half here comes to
an
end
[Applause]
[Applause]
w
so the two teams have switched around
and the second half is
underway good ball over the top and a
good looking
[Applause]
ball well they survived the
attack and the pass not quite accurate
enough and a throw in
then
matsuda
Gomez
[Applause]
Leu moving the ball forward how creative
can they
be really good buildup but no end
product well the cross was acceptable
but no one there to thump at
[Applause]
home
[Applause]
Jong not to like about that pass pass
unable to make anything of the
Cross effective
press and the counter attacker on
options
[Applause]
available really fine piece of Defending
play to break us
up incisive pass and the flag has gone
up here offside the
decision committed challenge that's a
good looking
[Applause]
ball oh that surely had to go in but
marvelous defending well the teams are
locked together will it stay that way
following this
corner L into the box and the ball
sailing over everyone in the
[Applause]
center
ESO 30 minutes to go
[Applause]
then oh stylish ball what can they do
now well he wasn't messing around with
the
[Applause]
clearance
[Applause]
moving the ball more than decently but
can they take the lead and running it
back well no problems
defensively and passing it
well Reed
now
ESO
Jong and showing fine Vision well deemed
to be offside by the meest of margins
well it's very close to being the
perfectly Tim run but whether it's an
inch or a yard he's still
[Applause]
offside and smart
[Applause]
defending
20 minutes to go in this
one options in the center and defensive
play to be
[Applause]
applauded Campbell on the ball really
clever pressing a really good passs
opportunity here and the keeper and he
react it brilliantly well from that sort
of range it's a great save I have to
say and the opportunity was there yeah
it's a well work corner and he makes
decent contact just lacking that bit of
accuracy Reed
now good tackle taken
away excellent refereeing advantage in
operation oh nice ball over the
clears it
away and given
away well he failed to get it away
properly well it comes to nothing in the
end can they push ahead on the closing
stages play towards the back post it
comes to absolutely nothing well maybe
good position from which to
[Applause]
counter Reed
now
Cavani
Reed clearance needed to be
[Applause]
better well he's lost
it and scope for them to produce
something
[Applause]
exciting PS it
back brilliantly
blocked and the teams are level and
every corner counts at this
juncture and over it comes well they
couldn't take advantage of the
chance growing pressure here and another
corner
oh a goal and is that going to be the
one that wins it for them there's every
chance and the fans are laughing this
[Applause]
up they are making Headway but really
they need a goal with time not on their
[Applause]
side well the referee not too happy with
the challenge and blows for a free
kick that's a well struck
pass deep
delivery teammate
available this could be it still
possibilities what a vital
[Applause]
intervention and there goes the final
whistle much to the disappointment of
their supporters yes Derek it was a
tough game between two
very
football has the power to oll to
Captivate and this occasion appears
irresistible two magnificent sides
intent upon impressing The Wider world
with a display of Technical and tactical
Brilliance so much riding on this and an
atmosphere to match the
mood it's coming up
live
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be enrolling I'm your
match commentator Derek Ray at the
microphone and sitting alongside me is
the former Arsenal West Ham and centry
Midfield player Stuart Robson and it's
going to be fascinating to see how these
two sides Fair as they come up against
each other Stewart what are you
expecting to see well thanks Derek the
best coach I played under would always
tell us before kickoff earn the right to
play if you can win your individual
battles outrun your opponent eventually
you'll get the space to show your
ability I'm sure that's be an echoed by
the coaches here
today just knocked it out of
[Applause]
there
meny committed challenge
Reed
now oh nice ball over the
top must take the lead here oh blocked
it pretty clear who got the last touch
so it will be a
corner
who's going to get on the end of
it just the clearance that was
needed so a throw in
[Applause]
here
Reed and defensive play to be
applauded Now options are
plenty the timing was perfect ball
one now look at this they might be able
to cash in
here
a bit sloppy in
possession promising
sequence can they not in front oh a
tremendous
block
clearing it
[Applause]
away they all know their roles as they
apply the
[Applause]
pressure DK laid to the
[Applause]
center well no damage
done but a good place to win it back and
let's see what it leans to Crossing
opportunity
[Applause]
a good Vision
there on no lck keeping
[Applause]
possession aware of the threat solving
the
[Applause]
problem can he put them in front closing
down well it might be oh can you believe
it
he's only gone and found the back of the
net we won't forget that goal in a hurry
spelling out just how deadly he can be
[Applause]
Sensational moving the ball forward with
purpose really clever
[Applause]
pressing corner kick awarded and let's
see if this will help them add to the
lead and able he dealt with behind for
another corner can they cash
in and he's fired over the corner can he
put it away oh such an elegant finish
how about that on the volley a brilliant
strike whatever way you look at it so
the ball rolling again 2-0 the
score
Cavani might be able to set up the
chance opportunity for them to get back
into the game oh tremendous reflex
action there from The Keeper well he
didn't have long to react did he but
that's a top class save I have to
say blade
over
Reed promising
pass clears it
away and flag raised offside well that
was always going to be offside he just
needed to hold on to the ball that
little bit
[Applause]
longer that was
SRO now let's see what they can do here
quick ball to perhaps catch them out and
a simple clearance a good
one we're using the space really well
but now can they push
[Applause]
on and Davis has it
and options in the
center well goal kick just as it was
looking
promising Campbell on the
ball and stuffing out the
danger can he find the right pass just
on able to get his cross beyond the
first Defender marvelous
[Applause]
anticipation and as a play it goes throw
in coming up
[Applause]
here
Jong
Cavani
ESO
[Applause]
re the timing was perfect ball
[Applause]
one and with that the first half draws
to a
close
all
so back underway here into the second
half lot to like about that
[Applause]
pass
he must finish tremendous defending to
Stonewall
[Applause]
him sound piece of
[Applause]
goalkeeping Campbell with
it successfully cut
out continues his
run and the flag has been raised well
disappointing it looked like a really
promising opportunity for
[Applause]
her and on the back of that particular
challenge will the referee let the
matter rest
there
[Applause]
and it's played into the center well he
was under a bit of pressure but he'll
feel he should have done a bit better
with the
header Chong
cell on the
ball throw in
given well the host as you can see have
enjoyed so much possession but their
attacking play has been too slow mainly
due to a lack of movement of the front
players oh look at this they must score
oh it's a goal and certainly a
deflection of the defender into the back
at the
net well as you can see he gets a bit
lucky here the deflection just had the
keeper wrong footed but he won't worry
about
that this is looking rather comfortable
for them 3
[Applause]
n
re
ESO thumps
clear
[Applause]
this is a message for Owen Kennedy Owen
happy birthday from your friend Jonathan
Fish and into the last 30 minutes
now Don cross could be
useful and putting paid to the
danger there it is a fantastic goal and
no wonder he's over of
[Applause]
celebrating
there's more tension in the air than
usual and you can understand why if they
get the victory today they'll be assured
of a place in the promotion match and
that is nothing to be sniffed
[Applause]
at live on EA
[Applause]
[Music]
TV and welcome to a game that really
should have pulsers racing every reason
to believe
this will be enthralling I'm Derek Ray
in the commentary position and I'm
joined for expert analysis by my partner
Stuart Robson and the Chance is on for
them to reserve for themselves a
promotion match place what do you
anticipate seeing Stuart well Derek it's
certainly in their hands if they win
here a promotion match will be theirs
they just need to put in a good
performance it won't be easy
[Applause]
though
[Applause]
a de
[Applause]
clearance who's going to get on the end
of it the well to clear it
away
felini space afforded
him and a throw in it's going to
be good tackle what can she do from here
big
chance
and getting in the way of that superb
defensive
play but a really good
run and creditors due for that good
piece of
Defending cbell on the
ball
ESO po
pass well the referee wasn't going to
let that
go well there's a really stylish piece
of
running the cross is
on high quality
defending
[Applause]
Corona still on level terms moving the
ball
[Applause]
nicely
feni an alert
intervention etto oh this looks
useful well showing excellent judgment
to intercept under real pressure
defensively will they pay the
price
Ker
well she keeps moving well didn't go to
plan in the
[Applause]
end and there to
intervene throw in
given
cbell wanted to keep it but
couldn't
ker good
idea and the ruling is offside
here that's very effective good high
[Applause]
pressing good use of Advantage by the
referee
Huddleston oh that's a fine
pass and a good looking ball not quite
the clearance they were hoping
for but it looked so threatening but the
danger
averted excellent
defending now the quick Counterattack
could be
on good through
ball cross fired over clumps
clear well a chance here perhaps to
invigorate their aerial targets
and over it
comes and a fine cross a smart stop
[Applause]
here
feni that's a very fine piece of
[Applause]
tackling well the outcome is a free kick
here
and the cross into the middle and
running through to the
keeper and the managers will now deliver
their halim team talks we're at the
[Applause]
end
[Applause]
yeah it's not the best
underway then in the second half and the
two teams matching each other just about
stride for
stride
still passing it around with authority
an important
interception great ball over the
top the concession of a corner here
well they've been frustrated for quite a
while now but these fans have suddenly
come to
[Applause]
life corner kick played in clearance
left a bit to be desired and quick
thinking defensively just have to make
sure they don't get caught on the
Counterattack
oh and a perfect fall now how about this
it's opening up for them and there it is
the opening goal One n and they'll feel
they deserve
it well here's the replay and just look
how quickly they break forward once they
win the ball back and the Finish is just
as good that's an excellent
goal
felini
and now
Corona
zunga
Corona
hudston and they to
intervene now what can they produce on
the
flank they won't complain about having
won the corner and maybe an opportunity
to increase their
advantage trying to pick out a teammate
oh that's not a good
clearance well able to survive that
attacking
push
faini and so 30 minutes left for play in
this
one happy to pass the ball but remaining
patient from all your friends and
family incisive pass
brillian an example of a goalkeeper in
top form here well the fans are
certainly having their say just listen
to them they thought that was a
[Applause]
penalty
ESO excellent
Vision well what an opportunity but
really good defending you've got to
say now in a more than decent
position can he make it count couldn't
grab hold of
it well it came to nothing in the
end well what a great save that was to
keep them in this may just be the
impetus they need as they certainly
haven't been at their best today well
nothing comes of the attack when all is
said and
done here's
ker 20 minutes to
go and the pass not quite accurate
enough and a throw in
then
oh they've lost
it and forcing the
error what an important piece of
Defending and both hands on it good
goalkeeping
zunga and passing it
well
green well doesn't have to do it on his
[Applause]
own it did look on for them but not to
be here's
Ker
faini
a very effective play in
possession oh that's magnificent
goalkeeping and now we find out it was
offside
anyway good ball to switch the
play an important
interception
might be able to set up the
[Applause]
chance
Jong now let's see what they can do
here a really good pass really good
buildup but no end
product decides to shoot and a goal they
lead by two now and that allows them to
breathe a bit more
easily so 2-0
now
[Applause]
pdon and there it breaks down but credit
to the
defense
[Applause]
could be
threatening but it stopped a promising
attack in its tracks and you wouldn't be
surprised if there's a card coming out
[Applause]
here
he could pick out a
teammate and a goal they've cut to the
lead it's not settled
[Applause]
yet well here's the replay and it all
starts off with that Crossing into the
box just begging for a teammate to get
on the end of it and it's a comfortable
finish in the and so the referee blows
for full time
