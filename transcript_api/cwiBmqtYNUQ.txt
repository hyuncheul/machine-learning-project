someone who said Kindred is such a
gigachad because the whole scene of
pre-season the trailer is Kindred icons
Kindred symbolism and Kindred colors and
Kindred as embodiment of death is still
here so anyway let's run down the Bingo
real quick we have atrox my money is
going to be the destruction of atrox
this entire story he killed people but
they are still here first of all atrox
his entire story he is still here banon
was killed but he is still here because
he refuse tonight trendir same story
after atro gave him some blood magic
trendir is still in here at the end of
the day zani was banished but she came
back after she possessed number one
student from Mastery and zani is back so
she is still here then at Tru and zani
started fighting they do not like each
other and the battle was so [ __ ] epic
that kale who is the aspect of Justice
Blind Justice by the way who was AFK in
the different realm she came back to
stop them so kale is still here but kale
came back with her mother who is the
true aspect of Justice aspect of Justice
Kale's mother got [ __ ] by zani Kale
asked for help rise answered rise was on
the mission to collect [ __ ] dragon
balls so he was gone which means he is
still here chat and uh you get the idea
yeah this this miira is Kale's mother
and morgana's mother J minutes baby guys
it could be good see when it comes down
to guys that we are covering we fitting
the entire story of the Void in the in
bvv because bvv is the Empress of void
she's the embodiment of void atrox went
dark [ __ ] crazy because of the Void
before that he was the warrior of
ascended species of ascended Warriors he
yeah he was ascended he was basically
get idea thanks to azir the whole
Ascension Shenanigans then he died
thanks to Zera then ascended Warriors
got confused because there was no
leadership so they started fighting each
other then we got someone who got
trapped in the fields of wheat you know
in the gardening section then we had
miira not zoi miira trying to stop the
war she taught humans how to stap darken
into their weapons for that miira asked
Nas's help who in return helped her find
Silver's weapon Silver's Boomerang is
the first weapon that was shown how to
trap [ __ ] darkin and and on the
subject of still here rise is still here
labang who is thousands of years old is
still here Vio the original l king is
still here and Brazil you cannot get rid
of Brazil Brazil is still here and then
we have the entire aspect of tarun and
since we had thind in the fum deal we
went with a little bit of trind story
with with the Y let's go baby let's
[ __ ]
go
tomorrow is a
hope never a promise
G lot of that people F your CH is dead
no he's better alive that is that ashes
tribe that's after TR got [ __ ] by
atrox
and yeah thetic already better than the
last we got who's
that Morana oh my God they're showing
this
[Music]
e let's [ __ ] go
sh holy [ __ ] all the I
behind they
hro solo
B in my blood it's in my
veins oh it's in my blood it's in
my vein
got my crush in the sake there is
nothing
SW it's a
[Music]
stretch is that invasion
of
holy [ __ ] that's invasion of
Bonia oh my God wait wait
[Music]
wait who's
[Music]
that now is it
all
time no [ __ ]
way I'm still
here bro y was
old y was [ __ ]
old
still
who that was that k no that's Ash's
[Music]
arow what was that
[Applause]
Kindra holy [ __ ]
[ __ ]
are you crushing
the there is nothing you can take in my
BL in my veins I'm
still I'm still here
wait
oh from downt Ash's
[Music]
ultimate
still
God
[ __ ] damn it Broski honestly I feel
like this is the year oh my I'm still
processing it broki death so Kindred is
death is the embodiment of death she
couldn't claim trendir because one he's
infused with atro's blood magic and he's
too angry to die and then we saw from
his rage Ash calmed him down oh oh oh oh
come back to bingo okay my question is
Morana and kale fighting atrox in the
story it was Kay and kill's mother who
got [ __ ] by atrox and here's Morana
but but take into consideration we saw
all the Yos so maybe that's that's in
the future hey chat which means would
you bingo at TRX check Mar not check Vio
not check clunk not check rise not check
T missing Pantheon missing Zoe mahisha
missing aelon Sal missing Leona missing
F Well trener was TR was in the in the
[ __ ] thumbnail so you know Ash we got
Ash that's a du we didn't see Brum sadly
we didn't see anything from shua and the
darken Worm but we saw k injured we saw
Morana we saw
kale belv as the void because void is
still here close so basically
chat you failed the goddamn Bingo chat
you suck at this game no no no jackpot
no jackpot for you you failed on that
what do you mean I'm just I'm just a
messenger you know I'm just a
messenger
anyway what a [ __ ] amazing cinematic
good job Riot and thank you for not
disappointing us like you did last year
that was a dub du cinematic true can we
watch
again it's like easy what hold up past
present and possible Futures we remember
them all so you want to tell me the very
last pick of Kindred was right all along
because that's that's deaf she remembers
them all because that's why I got
confused about kale and Morana fighting
atro that's a possible
future yua being old also possible
future because let's be real yasu he
ain't going to live that long if he
keeps flashing his Mastery 7 you know
thank you for finally using K on H
characters while they have best concept
of this game lore actually true I just
cannot wait till we expand on the entire
fight of life versus death which
includes void ases well and I mean void
void you know let's go again tomorrow is
a
hope never a
[Music]
promise
that is kind because one could say maybe
he sees Ash in here as his hope of
living in here but see the thing is Ash
is not as Fick as Kindra hey don't look
at me look at Riot they design her to be
that Fick you know it I know it everyone
knows it I'm just
saying although hold the very last
frame she looks more humanlike hold up
what if he sees both of
them
the shapes I used to
take
like it's
[Music]
EAS
all will
St like got
eyes and My
Shadow stretching now through all the
things I left
behind
it's in my blood God he looks so [ __ ]
good it's in
my crush in the sake there is nothing
you can
take my BL in my face I'm still
here maybe it's a
stretch that I won't come
done but I will Brave the
cold to finish what
[Applause]
i' but I mean we can officially call him
daddy Yasuo just just stating the
facts like
cutting and My
Shadow stretching
[Music]
[Music]
out I'm still here
[Applause]
all the
reason like
night playing in my mind all the times I
got to fight I'm still
here
and there we
[Music]
go L accurate moment where chinder is
supposed to die in here but at tr's
blood magic is keeping him alive and
then they shorten the story but in the
long term his love for Ash is also
keeping him something alive something to
fight for because his marriage to Ash at
the beginning was a political one
because he needed help some so
[Music]
good there she
[Applause]
[Applause]
is he crushing my St there is nothing
you
can in
my in
my I'm still
[Music]
[Music]
here
[Music]
but I mean classic Ash ADC instead of
shooting her e towards b or Dragon she's
shooting it God knows where you know to
the top like bro you
know still [ __ ] amazing bro well done
R up well [ __ ] done thank you as a
League of Legends player I'm finally
happy for now because in a couple of
minutes I'll start playing the game and
then I'll remember why I'm not happy
anyway straight up [ __ ] amazing can
we appreciate the animation Next Level

need to go frame by frame to see the
hidden details because there are hidden
details Easter eggs more stuff you know
