gosh guys honestly this is literally the
best animation that Riot did so far like
from far away this is definitely the
best one of course uh the the time
passes and the CGI everything gets more
professional more like real life more
realistic but I wasn't expecting that
realistic that was so amazing it's
always so much fun to watch animations
of League of Legends because you are
used to play with them like in a game
when you see them almost getting like
real like alive because it's so
realistic with the pors the the the
details everything that feels like they
are real it's so Majestic this song is
really good too but honestly I was
paying more attention to the animation
it was so much details that I couldn't
pay attention to everything probably I
didn't see some of things so you guys
