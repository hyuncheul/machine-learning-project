card

last ditch defending and it wasn't
taxing for the
keeper just the clearance that was
needed well so close to getting that
early goal there but it was a wonderful
Save By The Keeper you have to
[Applause]
say
well there's an example of how to press
high
up well such a high degree of difficulty
not quite in the end well how good was
that it's such a difficult piece of
skill which he made Look So Easy that

one well possibilities in the
[Applause]
center and a good challenge to bring
that attack to an
end superb looking pass and quick
thinking
defensively
well a top-notch piece of defensive
[Applause]
judgment body in the
way well we simply had to feature him
today after he broke the club's goal
scoring record his last appearance well
as you mentioned the record was broken
last time out but expect more today this
is a player that's hungry for go oh
sorry Stuart look at this oh incredible
save and he snuffed out any sign of
danger well he's won the ball and a
clear foul but the referee letting the
play
[Applause]
Flow D in a position of
[Applause]
Menace now with
Messi
Hardy well there's a living breathing
example of positional
sense
Divo a foul but Advantage
played
Modric you can sense the threaters
there and it cross the touch line so a
throw in
here neelson well no let up plenty of
pressure wasteful from
Den good use of Advantage by the
referee and the pass a good
one cross fired over well pretty
straightforward for the keeper you've
got to
say well that one has
[Applause]
promise a fine block
[Applause]
and begging to be put away and the
keeper nowhere to be found not that he's
[Applause]
complaining
Hardy
[Applause]
possession given away
unfortunately this could level it oh not
to be stopping a certain
goal and back now with
Hernandez a really good pass and a
strong glove on the ball from The
Keeper a very effective play and they
might be on to
something that is how to keep it out of
the
net
a good Vision
there and players waiting in the
center passing it accurately and passing
it well and he's made it a brace for
himself The Defenders just unable to
stay with him and he's having a field
[Applause]
day well potential
[Applause]
danger
Messi excellent assessment of the
situation at the
back
let's see about the cross and still
danger here oh tremendous reflex action
there from The Keeper well he didn't
have long to react did he but that's a
top class save I have to
say onto
hernandz good waight on that
pass nicely timed
tackle well approaching halime on the
home side very much in charge here
Stuart your thoughts well they're
dominating this first half their
approach play their cleverness around
the box and the finishing have been
excellent they just need to continue
this going into the second
[Applause]
period and defending as a
unit
that is that for the first half
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
here
so back underway and an intriguing
second half in
Prospect
a chance for him to get in behind maybe
and running in
behind
[Applause]
Hardy and a throw coming up after that
authoritative challenge
well a disappointing throw in
there nice looking
pass cross could be useful not in fact a
bit too close to the goalkeeper and that
was always going to be
claimed
Messi and does well to keep it in
play and space to cross it terrific
block really closing him
down it's with
Romero
[Applause]
what a magnificent
pass oh and it goes now he has his
hattick a special moment for
him onto
[Applause]
Messi oh that's a super piece of
[Applause]
Defending
[Applause]
we saw the situation
developing with the owner of the blue
car registration bg4 D please your
vehicle your lights are
on well he's given us
away
onto
[Applause]
Messi
Divo oh great
vision can't miss and a goal he's put it
away a celebration
[Applause]
moment and the cross into the middle not
quite the clearance they were hoping
for and the referee Blows the Whistle it
is a free
[Applause]
kick and back now with
Hernandez and into the last 20 minutes
Divo oh tremendous
vision and back now with
Hernandez an effective
[Applause]
ball that's a lovely
ball and snuffed out danger
immediately illegal play and hence a
free
[Applause]
[Applause]
kick cing infield here textbook
defending Inside the
Box just 10 minutes remaining here
Modric well that challenge was overly
robust to say the least now we look
towards the referee what will her
decision
be good
[Applause]
distribution
clean
challenge an attack C A Promise that's a
useful cross but it wasn't quite as good
as it looked when it left the
boot well on the cusp of the final
whistle and the homide Really prospering
today Stuart interested to get your take
well what an excellent performance this
has been they've had complete control
for most of the game their movement
clever passing and energy have been a
joy to watch it's been a really good win
for
them
[Music]
Hardy sloppy in possession from
Zeno and the electronic board showing
one additional
minute
this is looking
[Applause]
threatening and there it is the final
whistle and the fans will be leaving the
stadium with smiles on their faces well
Derek what a good performance that was
they did most things right and their
attacking play was inventive and had a
real Cutting Edge that was a really
dominant display from them
today
[Applause]
it is the first game of a brand new
season and as always on these occasions
a positive atmosphere enveloping the
stadium and the players who hope to get
it right first time can they
deliver the action is live on

good evening and welcome ahead of what
should be a pulsating night of football
my name is Derek Ray and ready with his
tactics board to provide all the
analysis is Stuart Robson and what we
have to look forward to is the opening
match of a brand new Club season what
might we see today Stuart well with the
start of a new season comes fresh hope
ambition and renewed ideas and both
these sides will want to start quickly
here today it should be a good
game
Modric oh that's a fine
[Applause]
pass could cross it in here promising
pass and he's clear as
lines and showing the importance of wit
targets available cross comes in oh a
moment of pure class had to catch it
perfect ly and didn't he
just well let's see this again this is
counterattacking football at its very
best and he makes no mistake with the
Finish he showed a lot of composure
there and scope for them to produce
something
[Applause]
exciting released it
[Applause]
nicely an alert piece of
Defending
Sakai let's see if something comes to
this now what can they do from
[Applause]
here and the pass defly cut out
def
Simmons Scot Scot make your way to the
ticket off what you like about that pass
thank
Divo now let's see what they can do
here and a clear foul but the referee
letting the play
Flow and he read it well
defensively possibilities Inside the Box
they won't complain about having won the
corner and maybe an opportunity to
increase their
advantage trying to pick out a teammate
well did his job
defensively
onto
Hernandez that's a well struck
pass following the clearance it will be
a
corner well just listen to the crowd
they know this is a big chance to
equalize
and there's the delivery well he almost
headed it
in nice looking
pass and passing it
well and having a
goal well it could have been a better
effort than I think we were all
expecting it would be
a good Vision there and that is
[Applause]
offside
Simmons good work to regain
possession
Divo onto Hernandez they might be able
to get in
now dangerous
ball just failing to hit the target good
effort
though
Now options are
[Applause]
plenty he's given it straight to the
opposition well the hosts have had so
much of the ball in the last 15 minutes
and have been really positive with it
they're creating opportunities and it's
surely only a matter of time before they
draw level
here well that's right and unusually
they don't have the ball on this
occasion and coly done despite the
mounting
pressure
oh nice ball over the
top
Hernandez Romero
now he's lost
it and quick thinking penalty in the
opinion of the referee and this is
seriously getting away from
them well no card just a warning and he
puts it away
confidently well as you can see the
keeper makes no effort in the end he was
hoping it would be struck down the
middle but it's an easy finish really
and played in oh good save excellent
header and the corner has been
given well these fans can sense an
opportunity here they need to make the
most of this
corner who can he pick out half-hearted
clearance really vital
interception and with that the first
half draws to a close
[Applause]
was
well underway once more and it's going
to be fascinating to see what
developments occur in this second
half
unable to keep the
ball attacking with
Vigor no chance perhaps and in oh yes
exactly what they were hoping to produce
they've delivered the
goal this is looking rather comfortable
for them 3
n
Modric
Divo quick ball into the
area but he stopped them just when they
looked
menacing good use of Advantage there and
it took a little Nick before it went
over the touch line so a throw in
here well they couldn't keep it
oh lovely weighted ball they might be in
and drawing it back and he finds a net
he could hardly
Miss no shortage of goals in this match
3-1 and playing it through well not to
be he have moved into an illegal
position well it's great that he wants
to run in behind but he has to get the
timing
right
not the best Challenge free
kick great ball over the
top and possibilities here well this one
help them get back into the game oh it's
in and just like that they're right back
in it with all the momentum behind
them well here it is again the ball over
the top is an absolute Beauty and he
makes the Finish Look So Easy what a
good goal that
is plenty of support
here and the ball is loose well they've
won themselves a corner and a chance
perhaps to add an additional goal for
security favoring the short
one
good tackle taken
[Applause]
away well that one has
promise and able to close down the
shot L into the box and he clears the
danger well the aways side haven't boss
The Possession as you can see but when
they have had it they've looked so
dangerous particularly when they press
high up the field win the ball back in
those areas and then Counterattack
quickly and he's in an offside
position he has teammates around him but
nothing comes of it good defending it
was
well they've lost possession of the
ball now delivering that deep cross and
a goal they've increased their lead and
they don't want to be throwing us away
from
here well here's the replay watch how he
goes past his man with such ease and
it's just a change of pace and then what
a great finish as well good connection
with the ball leaving the keeper with
little chance it's a great
goal into the final 20
minutes dangerous ball taken care of
business defensively
here
Kai counterattacking very much an
option must be they need to get bod's
back and in oh yes exactly what they
were hoping to produce they've delivered
the
goal Divo
[Applause]
could be
[Applause]
threatening and they've played their way
into
[Applause]
trouble and he has options
available oh good looking
run well nothing for them to worry about
in the end good
[Applause]
defending here with
Hernandez just 10 minutes remaining
here well great read there to
intercept
Divo well there to
[Applause]
intercept incisive pass and it's going
to run through to the keeper
here
good Vision can he get onto this and
he's found a bit of
daylight oh it looked as though he might
be through not
[Applause]
so possession lost
intercepted and teammates around
him
Divo and we are going to have two
additional minutes keeper did his job to
begin with and stopping the danger
pressure applied can they make something
of
it oh nice ball over the top to chase
couldn't put it away offside however
well he'll certainly be pleased to see
the flag go up there because that was a
poor
Miss and there it is the final whistle
not what the home fans were hoping for
before a ball was kicked today defeat
for
them
