match how do you see the match going
Stuart well thanks Derek what a game we
have in store here the motivation
couldn't be any higher a win here and
they'll get themselves a promotion match

exciting plenty of forward momentum here
but can they
produce
Özil well the referee not too happy with
the challenge and blows for a free
kick well it works like this breaking
the club's goal scoring record brings
you attention well she's got the record
but she's such a good goal scorer I'd
expected to add a lot more to her tally
starting today what a talent she
is good use of Advantage by the
referee well it looked highly promising
but they got nothing out of
it there's to win it
[Applause]

[Applause]
be sound Piece of
[Applause]
[Applause]
goalkeeping niely Time Tackle
[Applause]
[Applause]
timely

forward what can they do with it
promising
pass
C Mar to the keeper well what a reaction
from the goalkeeper such a good save in
the
[Applause]
end and over comes the corner can they
keep it out oh it comes to nothing in
the end really should have made more of
that well you have to think they're
going to take the lead at some point cuz
they really looking dangerous at the
moment well he needed to read it to get
there and
[Applause]
did Crossing
opportunity a really good pass are they
going to forge ahead oh the keeper made
it look routine it was anything
but throw in's
given just the challenge that was
[Applause]
required and that a piece of goalkeeping
you're going to see again and again and
[Applause]
again
trying to deliver it
accurately and nothing comes of it an
opportunity to forge your head from this
corner
[Applause]
situation and just wide with a
[Applause]
header
[Applause]
chance to do
damage Splendid defending and it needed
to
[Applause]
be promising
sequence danger
[Applause]
averted a very timely
[Applause]
interception
Alex Walker now not to like about that
pass chance to finish a smart stop
[Applause]
here
can someone get on the end of this well
the danger is still there he'll have a
go
here teammates in the middle unable to
make the mark with that
cross so the whistle then we're at the
halfway stage in this
match
the
[Applause]
into the second half then and these two
sides are locked together just can't
really choose between them at the
[Applause]
moment oh yes what a f
pass well you've got to give him credit
for that piece of Defending now
counterattacking possibilities here and
it looked like open road for them but up
a dead
[Applause]
end a chance to whip it
[Applause]
in boiling his opponent
[Applause]
completely
[Applause]
Franklin did well to win the ball
back and a lot to like about this
attack and it crossed the touch line so
a throw in
here the switch of play
now
[Applause]
could be and a goal that will do it
they've been pushing for it and now
they've been
rewarded
Alex
[Applause]
mati
nef a very effective challenge put in
this looks
promising
Hashimoto try to really get up the
opposition
[Applause]
here
[Applause]
three 30 minutes left for
play well passing moves like this will
keep confidence levels
up now both the cross work out for them
and a confident
clearance well after pressing like that
maybe the short route to
[Applause]
goal and he might profit
here he's blocked
it and the referee has given the corner
so maybe scope here for them to add to
their
[Applause]
lead who can they pick out and danger
still no nonon
clearance well just listen to these fans
they believe a goal is coming
[Applause]
here and space to cross
it and defending as a
unit
Walker well they continue their push for
The Equalizer but definitely not forcing
it just couldn't play that decisive ball
now break at PACE potential
danger really fine piece of Defending
play to break us
[Applause]
up Reed
[Applause]
now promising move from
[Applause]
madlads perfect tackle
[Applause]
[Music]
Walker in
possession
Franklin
Alex at times they make passing look
easy now it still could be
[Applause]
dangerous and possibilities here a very
timely interception well totally
confused as opponent
that's a nice looking ball and just a
bit too much height on the
[Applause]
header well what an atmosphere we've got
inside this Stadium the fans are driving
the players on here surely they're going
to hang on
[Applause]
now
Jong
Özil Reed now it's a Well struck pass
and that is
[Applause]
offside so almost at full time and the
home side on course to eek out a narrow
win Stuart your thought want well it's
been a tight game but I think they've
been the better team they've just had
that little bit more quality certainly
in attack and of course they've been
well organized at the back they just
need to see this through
now chasing this game desperate for a
leveler great defending here and offside
it
[Applause]
is
that's a lovely
ball pumps
clear Reed
now
Hernandez will he find the net oh a
challenge of the highest
[Applause]
order he has time to play us over not to
like about that pass and Under Pressure
that was a fine claim and there it is
the final whistle and the fans will be
leaving the stadium with smiles on their
faces well Derek it was a really tight
game but they were the better side over
the 90 minutes and they fully deserved
their Victory
[Applause]
today
[Applause]
[Applause]
oh
I
their target is Crystal Clear promotion
is what they want and here they have a
chance to help their cause this the
first promotion match and they know the
opposition won't be in the mood to do
them any favors at
[Applause]

extra Edge that extra bit of pressure
and the players know they've got to
deliver it's the first promotion match
so much on the line and we can't wait
for the excitement
stay with us on
eatv one of the great things about
football is that no one knows for sure
what's going to happen let's see what
unfolds here tonight my name is Derek
Ray and my commentary partner as usual
is Stuart Robson and how will they Fair
unless their first 10 of a promotion
match in the division Stuart your
expectations yeah it's certainly a big
game today up to now they've been really
good can they just go that little bit
further and put in an excellent
performance
here he read it well
defensively
[Applause]
cbell
[Applause]
Jong Reed
now Campbell with
it
heril and a tidy
tackle good looking
[Applause]
sequence and played the pass
well
tremendously strong in the tackle could
cross it in
[Applause]
here and defensive play to be
[Applause]
applauded he's found a pocket of
[Applause]
space well nothing comes of it it looked
promising
[Applause]
lovely ball over the top and the
assistant referee has raised as flag
offside
[Applause]
Jong rewarded for that brilliant High
Press Crossing
possibilities
[Applause]
and the referee allowing the game to
flow using
Advantage just the clearance that was
called
[Applause]
for
must take the lead here and a decent
save full
credit playing it in half-hearted
clearance
[Applause]
just the challenge that was
[Applause]
required and super vachi looking
dangerous
here element of risk there but he's won
the
[Applause]
ball and teammates around
her find reading of the
[Applause]
situation chance to
cross oh nice ball over the top to chase
could still be
dangerous cuts it back and a good
looking
ball and the keeper will happily collect
that
[Applause]
one
just lost his Focus throw in
here
Zaki throw in's
[Applause]
given they might be able to get in
now and still danger
[Applause]
here well super Vach have controlled the
ball over the last 15 minutes as those
stats tell us and have looked great
going forward they just need to take one
of the chances they've created to get
themselves ahead
today well first they have a bit of
Defending to do
[Applause]
and a good challenge to bring that
attack to an
[Applause]
end No Nonsense
clearance High pressing and good high
pressing now a decent
position
might lead to a chance is this the
moment a goal the opening statement of
the match a rickley deserved lead and
now they can
celebrate a tremendous
Vision intercepting it
intelligently well inching towards halim
and probably fair to say the fans were
hoping for a little bit better than this
Stuart your thoughts well it's it's been
a fairly even first half so far but they
haven't shown enough creativity
particularly in Midfield where there's
been too many negative passes if they
can get the ball into the front areas
that little bit quicker I think they'll
get back into
[Applause]
this a good Vision
[Applause]
there now play stopped it is a free
kick
it's a fierce effort and that is a free
kick artist at work what a goal it
was well here's another look and the
technique is just ridiculous outside of
the boot lots of power and all the wall
and keeper can do is admire The Audacity
Of it we're going to be seeing this over
and over again
Derek a chance then for the respective
managers to address their charges it is
halime
[Applause]
here
[Music]
see
so back underway here into the second
half good work by super velocci out
wide well read to put an end to that
[Applause]
attack it needs an accurate
[Applause]
cross fed over towards the back post
[Applause]
Reed aware of the threat solving the
problem well there's a really stylish
piece of running and it might be well
not an effort for his own personal
scrapbook
well that one has
[Applause]
promise and the referee playing
Advantage
Jong lost possession
[Applause]
Zaki now with
Pepe well we can give them high marks
for their passing but can they make this
pressure count oh it comes to nothing in
the end really should have made more of
[Applause]
that and the danger as aever
[Applause]
it
ridwell now with
Pepe and so 30 minutes left for play in
this
one Crossing opportunity wonderful
header excellent goalkeeping now the
teams are locked together will it stay
that way following this
corner and over it comes and making sure
it wasn't
problematic
Hernandez Campbell and good use of
Advantage the referee allowing play to
continue
Hernandez it ought to be the
goalkeeper's
[Applause]
ball now with
[Applause]
Pepe and an effect of
clearance
Jong can he play it in he read the
situation defensively and did his
job the referee spotted the little Nick
on the way through so a throw in coming
[Applause]
up poor
[Applause]
pass
super vachi moving the ball forward what
can they do from
here good through ball flag Rays for
offside
Jong J Che Happy Birthday J from all of
your friends including Mike Trevor and
Bri
well it's one pass after
another good
distribution and super Bachi have it
once
again that's a good
ball
heril it has to be every goalkeeper
would expect to catch that
one 10 minutes to go then and a goal at
this stage could be
decisive really well
positioned oh you don't want to lose the
ball in that position oh it's a penalty
and what a huge moment at this
jumction
well some might say he's been fortunate
to avoid being shown the card well I
like that from the referee just because
it's a penalty in it goes a well taken
[Applause]
penalty what what a big moment in the
dying Embers will it prove decisive
here can he find the right
[Applause]
pass well that's how to keep the
opposition at
Bay but showing a willingness to attack
as they must given the circumstances
time running out crucial piece of
Defending
spot on with that
[Applause]
tackle and the referee Blows the Whistle
it is a free
kick
Özil good use of
advantage and the referee has added on
two minutes of stoppage
time well really not giving her A
Moment's
[Applause]
Peace well shielding the ball admirably
keeping it on the ground slightly of
Target
however well late in the game here they
know what they need and that's an
equalizer just unable to get his cross
beyond the first Defender ball is
loose and there goes the final whistle
it's gone the wrong way as far as the
home fans are concerned yes Derek it was
a tight game between two very good sides
but they lost concentration late on and
it's cost them dearly they'll need to
get over that
quickly
it is a day of real residence and
significance what an opportunity a
chance to win promotion and they have it
in their own hands win the game and
write you
[Applause]
history the action comes your way next
on EA
[Applause]
TV
and welcome to a game that really should
have pulsers racing every reason to
believe this will be enrolling I'm Derek
Ray your match commentator and alongside
providing all the Tactical and technical
analysis it's Stuart Robson and if
everything falls into place for them
today we'll be
talking
there have been days of eager
anticipation prior to this gargantuan
Clash but now we need talk about it no
more and instead focus on the here and
now a match that has the capacity to
delight and Dazzle no matter who you
support two highlevel sides ready to go
at
it you're watching
[Applause]
eatv
one of the great things about football
is that no one knows for sure what's
going to happen let's see what unfolds
here tonight I'm Derek Ray and joining
me to provide expent analysis is Stuart
Robson and the Stag is set for club's
match action how do you it has to be and
a goal an early boost for them the first
goal of the game they're off and
running
heril and he takes it
away wander now in potentially a
dangerous position well it came to
nothing in the
end
[Applause]
Hernandez
extremely sloppy in
possession Campbell on the
ball here's
Hernandez went in strongly to win the
ball Modric
can he do
it penalty in the opinion of the referee
and this is seriously getting away from
them and on the back of that decision
now it's a caution well it's a tight CAU
and the penalty is converted I don't
think anyone really questioned
him so the ball rolling again 2-0 the
score that they look as though they want
to make this move CCH
and delivered towards the back first
well pretty straightforward for the
keeper you've got to
[Applause]
say that's a lovely
ball well since they have the ball the
referee playing Advantage
here the Defenders know you can't really
allow space like
that
Reed now is this the moment and oh it's
in we cannot declare this contest over
they still
believe
kesic not high quality
defending
pic
and the referee felt he had to blow the
[Applause]
whistle Reed well not giving him any
breathing
room and that is
[Applause]
offside
[Applause]
well that header was never going to be
problematic for the
[Applause]
goalkeeper an alert
intervention and teammates to play it to
well it looks so promising but a goal
kicked the outcome accelerated in the
stadium thank
you cleared away
comprehensively good use of
Advantage
Tong delivered into the
box and steered back under a bit of
pressure
and now Ru has
it and the referee Blows the Whistle it
is a free
kick not a good
pass well she was up to the
task
[Applause]
going
short and players waiting at the bar
post and a harmless effort when all is
said and
[Applause]
done might be able to get in behind the
defense is it going to be
and a goal my goodness they've changed
the course of this game level
now so the ball is running again at two
all just cutting off the
[Applause]
supply Campbell with
[Applause]
it opportunity to take the lead
oh my word there's excellent timing for
you what a
[Applause]
challenge
heril
three it leads an accurate
[Applause]
cross well that's the sign of a well
organized
defense
difficult to stop
[Applause]
him not Advantage with them referee says
play
on a poor cross All Things Considered
just have to make sure they don't get
caught on the
Counterattack well that one has promise
can they take advantage of the situation
but a good piece of Defending to bring
it to an
end so one minute of stoppage time
that's what the officials have
[Applause]
said a chance then for the respective
managers to address their charges it is
half time
[Applause]
here
like
and as the second half commences both
sides can reflect on a first half in
which they were so very evenly
matched
[Applause]
pesic brilliant
pass
well the attack carried promis but Peter
out and encouraging Wanderers move
this takes it on it was on its way in
can they Forge ahead from this corner
kick let's
see
it's a short
one not a chance for them again to play
it over from the corner
[Applause]
flag they favored a short one
here and a decent
[Applause]
delivery
Hernandez
showing good defensive
judgment
[Applause]
Özil Campbell with
it and that is
offside well it's all about pass ing as
they try to hit the
front a good Vision there well cleared
away superb defensive judgment to end
the
[Applause]
attack the Defenders know they need to
get tighter and credit is due for that
good piece of Defending
[Applause]
perisic
Modric
Ru it should be and what a magical save
it
[Applause]
was can someone get on the end of this
and the problem not completely solved
reading it
well the delivery towards the back
post emphasis on the clearance a good
[Applause]
one chance to
cross opportunity
missed
[Applause]
good through
ball and a useful
Cross Sound piece of
[Applause]
goalkeeping good example of pressing
without the
ball and that's great work to keep it in
play for Mar to the keeper well what a
reaction from the goalkeeper such a good
save in the
[Applause]
end let's see about the delivery and
it's in the back in front stunning
scenes
[Applause]
here well let's look at this again it's
a decent Del Del into the box and it
ends up with a fairly simple finish
certainly not much the goalkeeper can do
about
[Applause]
that wose have it
back now options are
plenty targets available cross comes in
well at one point on its flight I
wondered if the keeper would have
difficulties but no problems at the
end just 15 minutes
remaining and showing fine Vision a
really top-notch piece of
Defending what the chance they could get
caught out on the break
here all hands on
deck L it to the center well that looked
promising but his timing was off well
great work out wide but he just gets
himself into an offside position
[Applause]
there well I think the fans are doing
everything they can to get their team
back into this but can they find that
moment of inspiration and get an
equalizer and a chance to weip it in
here able to clear the danger at least
for
[Applause]
now
Ru well thumped
clear counterattacking
chance they need to get bodies back on
the ball in an attacking position but
they've got to do something positive
[Applause]
quickly he read the situation
defensively and did his job
[Applause]
well almost at full time and this is not
really what the home fans had in mind
Stuart interested to get your thoughts
as always well what a finale this will
be they've had so many chances
throughout the game but they just need
to find a composed finish in the dying
moments they've certainly deserved
something from this game but time is
running
out plenty of room for the wanderer's
attack well nothing comes of it it
looked promising now breaking at PACE
potential
danger really fine piece of Defending
play to break us
[Applause]
up took a really smart piece of
Defending to stop
them and there goes the final whistle
much to the disappointment of their
supporters well Derek not quite good
enough to day yes they only lost by one
goal but I never felt they were in
control of the game a frustrating day
all around for the coach to think about
for the next
time
for
h
for every player and every fan here
today there is the knowledge that
history could be made win the game and
win promotion it is that simple and
everybody is up for
it we'll have all the action for you
next on EA
TV
one of the great things about football
is that no one knows for sure what's
going to happen let's see what unfolds
here tonight I'm Derek Ray and my
commentary partner as always is Stuart
Robson and if everything falls into
place today we'll be talking about
promotion how's it going to go Stuart
well what a great opportunity for them
here a win today and they will be
promoted this really should be an
exciting game I'm looking forward to
this
one excellent refereeing advantage in
operation intercepting it
intelligently and it's still on and save
by the
[Applause]
keeper and short it
is and whipped into the box and a goal
that is a very bright start perfect way
to
[Applause]
open and the ball moving again what sort
of response will we see from them
now excellent
vision and that's a
corner
now sending it in and the danger is
avered well a very important record
broken last time out you're looking at
the club's new all-time top scorer yeah
what a great achievement but she won't
want to stop there she loves scoring
goals and I'm sure there's a lot more to
come from her including a couple today
maybe well tring that final pass you
just
feel that is a very fine challenge in
difficult
[Applause]
circumstances
Modric now he must favor the
cross interception to Snuff out the
danger it looks promising chance to
equalize well I think you could call
that an escape it looked a certain
[Applause]
goal and a decent
delivery magnificent challenge to win it
back and quick thinking
defensively that's a lovely ball in with
a Chance
well good defending clattered out of
[Applause]
there but he's gone short with
it and they'll get ready for the throw
[Applause]
in oh that's not a good
clearance well the counter chance looks
very
real fful
pass and not cleared away properly and
held by The Keeper at the second time of
asking well he's just pulled off a great
first save there now they can all calm
down
saani perfectly positioned to take it
away the clearance wasn't
[Applause]
decisive iner of
[Applause]
space excellent ball over the
[Applause]
top as eyes for goal he's blocked
[Applause]
it now who can he play it
to L into the box a decisive clearance
it was
[Music]
now there to
intercept
saani
Modric nice looking pass able to deal
with the
threat this might be ideal for the
counter
the attack carried an initial threat but
fizzled
out
tarap not looking all that comfortable
on the
ball well using the space really well
you've got to
say he takes aim well that'll be a
corner a goal here would really change
the complexion of this
match well just listen to the crowd they
know this is a big chance to
[Applause]
equalize who can they pick out good bit
of
Defending old boys could get in behind
the defense oh nice ball over the top
just the kind of save every goalkeeper
would expect to
make here with Hernandez and a lot to
like about this
attack firing it towards
[Applause]
goal well the host have had most of the
ball in the last 15 minutes and some of
their play has been really good and if
they can continue to control the ball as
they're doing at the moment I'm sure
they get that
[Applause]
equalizer and now Ru has
it effective piece of
pressing
Tara and the keeper with the
ball
ö
Hernandez good looking
pass options in the
[Applause]
center far from a good
pass and there it is the halim
[Applause]
whistle
all
best well underway once more and it's
going to be fascinating to see what
developments occur in this second
half Crossing
opportunity good distribution that comes
to nothing in the
end a good and fair
challenge
Park they've regained possession
[Applause]
that's a good looking
ball really important piece of last
ditch
defending and it took a little Nick
before it went over the touch line so a
throw in
[Applause]
here team
[Applause]
available a really single-minded piece
of Defending to make sure nothing unto
happen thumps
clear
[Music]
all decent position for the old boys to
be
[Applause]
in that needs an accurate
[Applause]
cross well that's good defending well
organized at the
back the referee allowing advantage to a
crew to them but doesn't have to do it
on his
[Applause]
own teamwork and passing in evidence
well it was a good-looking sequence but
it comes to an end now can they hit them
on the
counter a really committed Challenge and
it's gone out for a throw
in Ru with
it
[Applause]
tarup
[Applause]
tarat oh he's blocked
[Applause]
it
Reed oh tremendous vision and cooly done
in the
[Applause]
end
saani well good run this now what can he
do with it magnificent
defending well the perfect tackle really
and now a throw
in possession regained by the old
[Applause]
boys well this looks really productive
what can they do from this position
defensive Brazilians to shut them
down well possibilities on the
[Applause]
center oh did so well to deny
[Applause]
him they favored a short one
here that's a nice looking
ball oh that surely had to go in but
marvelous defending well maybe a good
position from which to
counter and the decision offside here
well over the last 15 minutes the old
boys have had the majority possession as
you can see from those stats and you
sense another goal is coming they are
really looking to finish it off
now yes who knows maybe another
opportunity in the works for
them realizing that it might be opening
up on the opposite
flank well couldn't find a teammate
unfortunately and a throw in to
come
now the old boys looking dangerous here
well they couldn't do anything with that
particular
cross racing forward trying to catch
them
[Applause]
out well it came to nothing in the
[Applause]
end not the best Challenge free
kick
gr and the keeper with the
ball tarab well by playing keep ball
like this they're keeping the opposition
at
Bay nicely cut
out woods with
it
tarap Crossing
opportunity and the No Nonsense
clearance going
[Applause]
well well that's good defending well
organized at the
back and we will have just one
additional minute aware of the threat
solving the
problem
and there goes the final whistle it's
gone the wrong way as
far dominated but the result will
certainly hurt them they need to bounce
back next time
out
everyone on tenter hooks you can feel
the tension because there's so much on
the line if they win they make it
through to the promotion match it is
that simple till they have the mental
fortitude
[Applause]
necessary live on
[Applause]
eatv
[Music]
that's
[Music]
