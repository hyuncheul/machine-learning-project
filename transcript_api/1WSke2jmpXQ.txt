halfway mark here Manchester United on

end so no more time left that concludes
the first half here at the theater of
dreams we certainly have got to give
this man high marks for his work up to
this point Stuart well I thought he had
a really effective first half not only
did he get the goal that gave him the
lead but his General play was really
good he was a
constant the second half underway United
with the advantage but no room for
[Applause]
complacency shielding the ball superbly

position and still looking to get the
shot
away well there's the pullback and it
goes the leveler thrilling stuff
here well let's look at this again he's
done superbly well to pick out a
teammate here but the keeper should do
better at his near post that's gone in
far too easily that's not good
[Applause]
goalkeeping well you can see ten ha's
frustration they've completely lost lost
their focus here so in business once
more on the back of that very important
equalizer
1-1 here's Luke

opposition at
