hello hello hello everybody Welcome back
to my channel hope you have a fantastic
day I had to um I had to take part of
the um the Largo Jin video that I did
that I posted not too long ago I had to
take part of it out the quotes and um
instead of just removing it I decided
just make it at some smaller video but
yeah here we go all right so the next
one we're going to do is the quotes this
quotes and I think this is by nobody
special or just know nobody and I will
put the video link Down Below in the
description and if you want to check it
out all right let's
go the world is cruel it doesn't have to
be
ugly art is worth the pain
H and now the curtain
Rises I like it our performance
begins okay okay I like it St stage is
set my audience I oh wait wait that gave
me CHS I will bring them an opera of
death breathe in the
atmosphere you will be
poetry you will be beautiful can I pause
it through my his voice kind of sounds
like there's an echo but not like um
like he's inside of a tunnel or
something I guess because he's got a
mask on that's very neat and also it has
like a monotone to it but it doesn't at
the same time it's very unique I like it
a
lot I work you shall
transcend I will make you
famous sing for me sing for me the of
the Opera I told you smile everyone is
watching this is your Curtain
Call a costume some makeup a spray of
blood H face the crowd and bleed for
them art shall Blossom from your
fear you will learn what beauty truly
is I have been planning your final
performance you haven't told for a very
long
time when they find you they will
cry I live for the Applause you will die
for
it
you've awoken something deep inside me
oh no don't say that I feel
inspired killing you will be one of my
finest
Works they call me mad all artists are
mad he's giving me such a serilla Vibe
though it's like my artwork is
beautiful giving me chills art I don't
like it requires a certain
cruelty I am misunderstood Beauty can't
be
evil I never Hur anyone it is the
performance that
kills my talent justifies all actions
justifies my genius will be understood
eventually art is such a Fickle
thing smiles and screams I bring both do
you art must exist Beyond Reason
Death is certain his voice is very monot
have to be ugly does he ever raises his
voice at all I want to feel everything
oh in Carnage I Bloom like a flower in
the dawn it's kind of pretty I have
risen from the filth and muck I am the
Lotus Blossom I and
Beauty no poet's words could match my
craft
this is my
love I am at my best only during the
performance that sounds like a kind of a
different voice be good I must be
Perfection every element must be in
place I am a slave to this
passion this art is a compulsion I
cannot resist it okay there is nothing
for me but this
I swear each performance is the
last but I lie every
time I can't live without the Euphoria
of
performance kind of delightful moment
before the curtain goes
up the Ecstasy of opening
night the Ecstasy of killing oh that
gave me chills don't do that he's very
um is pain full of himself the moment
before the shot is
painful It Hurts So
Good okay each bullet is a
song each bullet will be a
dance each bullet is a piece of my soul
each shot is a piece of
me Bliss comes only in the moment before
I
fire it is only when the gun fires that
I am alive alive H okay it's very simple
they are puppets I pull their
strings when I shoot they
dance they will dance they will sing
they will
die how lovely oh he raised his voice
the show never ends he seems kind of
happy wait for your queue you're only
here to Herald my entrance
he's very full of himself I will not
suffer this
ugliness this stage is beneath my talent
but I shall elevate it I suppose I must
make do with this tdre
setting how inelegant your words are
surely a fool wrote your
script why would anyone listen to a
creature so ugly you have too many
lines this would be easier if blood came
in more
colors symmetry is so
boring do you think you can stop my
performance you lack
imagination you belong in the shadows no
audience could love you a don't say that
understudy can't upstage me your work
will be forgotten I am ahead of my time
but before you ask you yes your whole
ensemble makes you look fat thank
you he's not very nice want to kill me
back then didn't you you helped lock me
away you tried to stop my work he got
locked away before art cannot be killed
my heart cannot be
contained I suppose you embody A
Primitive minimalism but you lack my
technique with my technique killing blue
booms into
artwork I have elaborate plans for
you I couldn't miss your performance
your life had no value before me only my
actions will make you
memorable life has no meaning but your
Death
Shall the end is important in all
things death should never never be quick
it should be an
Opera there is no drama in a peaceful
death got angry
there there is Art here waiting he
sounds so sad most the time though
everyone wears a mask I just chose to
create my
own behind every mask is another mask M
only to the audience do I show my true
face yeah what did you really look like
the face of your killer is identical to
mine you will
perform I shall choreograph this
affair how can we make this
fresh the composition needs
something fabulous
fabulous red is a primary
color I like a violent color
composition Perfection isn't good enough
ooh I will touch your heart don't do
that G I am the singer without a voice
the dancer without
legs which is the LIE The Mask or my
face well that was deep my work asks
questions it never has
answers the trigger on a loaded weapon
it Whispers for us to
act I have a thirst for
melodrama until they stop me I will keep
going Smiles everyone
Smiles they're going to live until they
die that is true that is places everyone
places start the music I will make them
dance I get nervous before every
performance but I need that
[Music]
feeling I wonder what they think when
they see
me I envy
silence because I must be
loud I orchestrate
death your finale will be a
duet now that is what I want to see
wonderful wonderful most of his voice
lines are very monotone though let's
start the show very
[Music]
interesting creeps me out though
listening to his voice lines like I said
it gives me such a serilla Vibe about
his perform him talking about his
artwork and stuff and justifying it very
interesting I love the tone of his voice
though all right guys so that was my
reaction to Jin's quote um I like I said
before this was in the larger video I
will have that link down below so go
check that video out and if you're new
