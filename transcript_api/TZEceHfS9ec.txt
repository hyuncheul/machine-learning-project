Liverpool and it's coming up live on
eatv
[Applause]
Nextel it is something very special
indeed to make it to a UEFA Champions
League final now these two teams are in
tent upon tasting Glory welcome to the
showpiece event on the European Club
calendar Derek Ray here in the
commentary position joined tonight for
live coverage by Stuart Robson it is
Manchester City taking on Liverpool well
Derek we've got some of the world's top
players out there tonight so this has to
be a great game doesn't it I just hope
to see both sides play to their full
potential I can't wait for
this introducing the starting players
for Manchester City ederson between the
posts Bernardo Silva plays alongside
rodri in the center of Midfield and the
lone Striker today is earing
Halland let's take a look at the
Liverpool starting 11 Allison begins in
goal Trent Alexander Arnold plays with
Andrew Robertson in the wide defensive
areas and the idea is to have just the
one Striker up there trying to POS
problems for the
[Applause]
opposition
Trent Alexander
Arnold Andrew
Robertson strong play here it's a good
Liverpool move in the
making but the danger averted for
now
[Applause]
that he could be on to
something
Holland
nothing to take on the shot and it has
arrived the opening statement in this
UEFA Champions League
[Applause]
final well as you can see he's just
placed that Beyond The Keeper that's a
very good
[Applause]
finish
now back on the way will that goal have
the effect of stinging Liverpool into
[Applause]
action you can't really tackle like that
and expect to get away with it booking
to come you would think well there we
have it the first yellow card of the
game and he's going to have to be
careful now there's a long time to go
[Applause]
here
he's using his strength to good effect
Alexander
Arnold that still could be
dangerous
Robertson onto
Salah attemp oh that's textbook
goalkeeping
[Applause]
and over it
comes and that is not going to help the
cause the header well Off the
Mark well it's frustration for yuren
clock that should have been The
Equalizer no doubt about
that
vadol now
Silva and City being afforded too much
room oh threat is
there opportunity oh that an
outrageously good stop well great
reflexing from The Keeper he did
brilliantly there
[Applause]
they're going for the short
one
AI emphasis on the clearance a good
[Applause]
one
just have to make sure they don't get
caught on the
Counterattack a tremendous
block
the short Corner routine and it's Salah
with the cross was it a great
clearance
Nunes and Diaz has it he read the
situation defensively and did his job
Walker here's
Alvarez real
CH and a goal I'll tell you what they're
going to be very hard to catch now name
on the trophy
Maybe
well as you can see he's given far too
much space but he's still had some work
to do and I think it's a very TIY it was
never in
doubt well you have to feel sorry for
Jurgen clock it's a lonely job when
things aren't going on and he needs to
make some big calls here and the ball is
moving again 2 N as how it
stands k
van
djk so
bosoy
[Applause]
mosalah he's protecting it
well and the goalkeeper touch that was
crucial Liverpool Corner
given
it lets to go
short he successfully got past him oh a
good diving
[Music]
[Applause]
save
[Applause]
taken
short delivery from Salah here clearance
wasn't
[Applause]
decisive given away by
city and there is the goal well that
changes the equation and they have the
momentum
now so let's take another look and wow
how cleanly does he hit that the keeper
was never going to save it what a good
goal that
is well that certainly makes it
interesting and suddenly pep guardo is
trying to bit a concern just look at his
face well the ball is moving again and
Liverpool are giving this a real
goal
Roby
here's
Alvarez and showing fine
visionand looking for the final pass
that will open things up and Bernardo
Silva has
it can he play it
in Bernardo
Silva and a very good
challeng penalty in the opinion of the
ref referee and this is seriously
getting away from
them well he's avoided a booking but the
complaints continue and I can understand
why I think it's a poor foul it should
be a yellow card for
me is it going to be 3-1 and it goes
toly
convered
well just look at this again it's a
great penalty right into that top Corner
absolutely no chance of theer
[Applause]
there underway 3-1 the
score
Jones and Diaz has
it
[Applause]
Andrew
Robertson so bosoy swappy there Bernardo
[Applause]
Silva this could be
Troublesome
Holland it might be closing down
well well there was impending danger but
good defending
[Applause]
a decent position for Liverpool to be
in and let's give credit to the
defending
[Applause]
foden Walker
now
Holland and that's quality
pass City get the
corner another look then at the penalty
[Applause]
goal and a short Corner let's see that's
someone to play it to and able to get a
body in the
way
Jones could produce the
defit an alert piece of
[Applause]
Defending Curtis
Jones encouraging move from
Liverpool he's an accurate
cross I'll tell you what that is really
Top Class
[Applause]
defending oh what an
opportunity and there is the goal he's
found the net Joy
uncombined well here it is again the
through ball is absolutely inch perfect
and what emphatic strike it is from s
hit with his laces it's a great finish
and a great
goal underway again and they' being
triggered to plenty of goals 3-2 at the
moment rodri aangi has it
[Applause]
Silva the ball with
rodri and the challenge HS them in their
[Applause]
tracks now who can he play it
to
Walker
B inser of
space using his physical strength to
make sure he doesn't lose the
ball
Pand and defending as a
[Applause]
unit mosala
pressure exerted but he keeps the
ball and possession given
away now can they counter
clinically can they take advantage of
the
situation hold on and a go I tell you
what but going to be very hard to catch
now may on the trophy
Maybe
well here it is again and the pace in
which they break forward is devastating
it's so hard to defend against and this
is H at his very best he's composed he
shows great technique and he just
smashes it Beyond The
Keeper well P look very pleased doesn't
he his side an in complete control here
that's for
sure so the current score line 42
[Applause]
Luis
[Applause]
Diaz and he stopped them in their
tracks
Walker the ball with
[Applause]
rodry ball back with Liverpool now
so
bosoy and on to Alexander
Arnold Curtis
[Applause]
Jones well it superbly to take back
possession well they might be able to
launch a
Counterattack
Holland it's there for him looked like a
certain goal but that's a great
challenge get R of it Alexander Arnold
now now
mosala
Nunes the cross rock out for them well
but claimed by the
goalkeeper
[Applause]
might be able to get in behind the
defense just couldn't get it through
could be a chance to break
here significant acreage for City to run
into pulls it back really good build up
but no end product
[Applause]
Jones Alexis
mcar and using his strength to Shield
the ball the referee has decided to give
the free kick decision the way of
[Applause]
City
[Applause]
Manuel
akanji here's
