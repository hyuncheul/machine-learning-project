hello welcome new year in new settings
let's make the best settings first set
this option to always on in this case
you activate another firing option that
does not move with touch
it is better to use this option in no
scope mode and this one when
zooming leave these two options in the
default mode and do not change
them another important part is scope
mode put it on
hold this is the best scope mode to
become fast player and get used to it
it set the rest of the options in the
scope section like this believe me you
will thank me
[Music]
later let's fix the peak section set
Peak mode to mixed disable Peak and open
scope and Camera rotation while
leaning well this is the best Peak mode
based on my experience and in the future
fut I will try to explain more clearly
with the hand cam
video and now it's time for the advanced
control section first of all enable the
headshot sound and then let's activate
this option
because when I hold the site option for
1 second the character sleeps
automatically and there is still no
additional sleep option jump climb
separate in this case two jump options
are activated for us the first is to
jump behind the wall and the second is
to jump and shoot the enemy behind the
[Music]
wall quick throw enable when this option
is active you can grab and throw the
grenade much faster than
before set the throwable quick wheel to
switch this will still allow you to
quickly grab the items you need to throw
[Music]
tap to Mark location enable out jump
disable transparent UI mode enable try
this in class
[Music]
mode activate throw consumables in this
case you can throw a help box to your
friend when you are in sight of the
enemy enable fpp swap Swap and fpp
dynamic holding to have a better view of
the fpp section put these options at the
last level to activate iPad View and
still your joystick will be much faster
than
before you must be aware that when your
friend marks the enemy watch out you
cannot see the enemy and this is
annoying let's solve this
problem now when you mark the enemy you
can easily see it and when you shoot the
mark Fades and you can see it
better one of your problems may be that
you can't see the enemy's Footprints in
which room let's solve this problem
[Music]
set the main screen audio marker to
classic
[Music]
Mode now see that the enemy is in these
two room rooms probably the second
floor the next problem is that when your
blood is low you have to click the
bandage every time to recover but this
takes a long time and is wrong to solve
this problem go to the settings in the
advanced control section and enable the
continuously used bandages option
[Music]
healing prompt enable auto open do
enable default parachute follow enable
match Auto massage
enable and at the bottom leave the show
throwable trajectory line option active
and set the default melee weapon carried
option to
dagger here on the left side disable
blocked sight warning and horizontal
swipe acceleration
options hold open map enable auto equip
melee W bone enable fire interrupt
method fire
interrupt the next problem is that you
have less visibility behind the cover
and you need to increase your visibility
to hit the enemy more easily to solve
this problem enable aim features
according to
me it is enough to use aim features at
the same time when you peek
and finally adjust the graphic settings
according to me and then I have made the
best sensitivity for you the
continuation of the video is very
important don't miss it and if the video
was useful please support me thank you
