all righty guys we're going back into
another game in the mid lane against a
Teemo I thought we were whoa I thought
we were going against an Ekko so I went
bone plating you can see my runes here
the only difference I would have gone is
I would have gone Second Wind uh since
we know we're against Teo now we
definitely want to get dor Shield
especially if we don't have uh Second
Wind you want some kind of mitigation or
rather like antip
pooke cuz if you don't you're going to
find yourself having to recall before
six and then he ends up getting half a
level on you and then you'll never
really be in a good spot to get a kill
so we're actually just going to let him
bully us a tiny
bit we're going to give up this
minion
okay right there I'm okay with this cuz
I
think I actually goof that oh I don't
know what I was doing there but that's
fine nothing the world that's a tower
shot he should actually just be dead
here I think he's going to die if I can
just get a flash Q on him damn I needed
to get that in range to hit him and that
minion at the same time but gu we
out he's just going to die
now um actually don't think he
dies three health I waited too long
man it was a pretty good flash by him I
guess I didn't think he'd even bother I
thought he was just dead but it's okay
we got we got Flash and he he does not
have flash weo I feel like he's going to
want to try and go up and Q me in a
second and unfortunately Lily will not
be getting kill but fortunately we
do
um I think this is good enough I don't
think it's going to hold long term but I
think it's okay this minion could just
die it's pretty
good it is lukewarm in terms of uh how
good it is let's get a
potion and fly back to Lane a little bit
unhealthy but doran's ring or dor Shield
rather will give us a bit of
healing okay let's get back into this
first kill Teo is good so I want to
explore a different build this game I
think there's a few different VI builds
um but we might just go for a standard
and talk about gam play
overall really quick I think we can
just wait for that oh
wow okay I thought he was going to queue
me on the way with my e and I'd have to
flash but I knew if he didn't quue me
mid E2 I would definitely just get the
kill on him um
so I had an idea I wanted to kind of
explain to you guys and that would be
to I honestly on how to just ro oh who
who I should be
okay a that Tower shot is uh to range
got me I think he's flash
yeah we're definitely going to be
uh he should have e and then flash but
even then the millisecond he uses his e
i flash away
um but when he flashes first it's e it's
less of a chance of him killing
me all right fly back to Lane Lily is
not going to get it so you do have quite
a bit of good options with
electrocute I think we want to stick to
the one primary build though we want to
stick to that standard build I will
spice up with Shadow flame I think we
can do it because they have a lot of
squishy Champions even I think Warick
will end
up it's good huge poke right
there get these M all stacked
up oh orick is four and0
perfect for that is sarcasm obviously
um just wait a
second okay level six
obtained this is tough I want to bot I
want to ro top I think Top Lane is the
move for whatever it's worth is uh does
Warwick have
ult I'm going to hope the answer is no I
mean killing Fiora three times probably
just got the experience off of
that this is not a situation where I
will be uh
leaving nice and this is very
important if you're ever in a spot like
that that where you're doing pretty good
your snowball Champion huge that person
who R to kills a bounty and your
teammate is inting you need to steal
that kill if you
don't fiora's gold will
reset and Warwick will continue to farm
feasts on her soul at least this way
she'll be worthless she'll be worth 150
gold instead of 300 every time she dies
112 or whatever she's worth
now
I
disappear let's do
this there we
go o can we get him can we get it no we
did
not H okay I have an idea no I was going
to recall uh in range of the tower turr
Bounty but not actually attack it but
I'm worried that the minions will this
new wave of minions will stop my minion
so we're going to push this normally and
hopefully not miss
much yeah I want to help but I don't
want to help bad enough to just die for
no
reason okay he has like and I don't know
where eeko is so we're going to
leave orick is also missing which I
don't
like I know the range of Warwick's e or
of his ultimate rather so I'm thinking
if I see him run up I'm not going to use
my e immediately I'm going to wait until
I think he's about to ult me and then
I'm going to e to hopefully uh miss
it
okay so let's go ahead and continue on
we have our beautiful storm search item
um it had been confirmed to be getting a
Nerf but it's still the best item for a
collie in my opinion so nothing really
changes in that
regard my mouse spe a little bit we're
good decrease this a tiny bit oh it's
good all right an enemy has been SL o
need to get queued by him I don't
actually don't it doesn't matter should
be
okay nice and there should be more
minion there should be more plopping I'm
actually going to keep running away I'm
not entirely sure where Ekko is cuz I
haven't been looking at the map as much
as I should yeah okay we're glad we did
that um teo's dead echo's I Eko can't
kill me here yeah he doesn't have any
kills he I have more than half Health
like we're
okay um we should be able to make this
work without ult but I'm using a potion
early all right this is your one shot
you guys can go in and I will help
you
that's huge very
huge no we almost stole the Z one I mean
uh uh good job bot Lane good stuff thank
you for yeah yeah good good work now but
obviously it's always nice to get
kills it's not the kill okay it's the
nice nice work
ouch ouch I don't think he's going to
mess with with cute maybe you
will yeah storm search proc is did we
even proc it I don't think we did we did
we didn't do enough
damage that is enough oh my gosh I'm in
trouble I was worried that Eko would be
healing my
Raptors and then he just happens to be
there yeah we're going to go ahead and
can we grab no we can't well if I sell
this no we can't
okay feel bad for Fiora although
obviously she did to herself um let's go
ahead and continue on I
know all
right
eny yeah teo's dead she should have
recalled he's just too
low
okay I guess he learns let's see if I
can do this
though yeah nice that's going to save
another oh let's give us even more time
man I should be probably
going we can still jump over that wall
and see 14 which is nice if they go for
Dragon I
mean they're dead yeah they're dead uh
there's nothing they can do I mean Swain
might be able to get away somehow
but
get back what I
take all right we'll push the wave I
actually shouldn't be wasting time like
this but it's too fun you know sometimes
the BM is more valuable than a few
seconds of
experience because it results in them
rage quitting you never
know that
AOE Warwick that feel in the entire rest
of the map is getting
own ooh that was too
much you that was too much I
think okay let's get out of
here
nice
enem let's continue on all right so far
so
good I
think we shall
continue yeah I think literally the name
of the game whether you have a lead of
like 10 kills or one is to shove in Rome
or shove and go for Lane kill
this yeah we we just made that little
mushroom guy explode oh my
God that was fun I enjoyed
that and that is going to be not the
first turret cuz it looks like Warwick
got to stand poor
Warwick
I mean he doesn't not blind he will just
die there wow it's already
up oh oh okay yeah I didn't see that
coming I guess we just um I guess uh
storm search did that after two and a
half second thing he exploded
after two
[Music]
seconds all right let's get out of
here all right let's get out of here
en all right let's get out of
here all right let's get out of
here right anyone
else thank god let's get out of here
yeah Swain Swain you know it is those
was a Swain
okay yeah there it
is all
right
uhoh is that the snipe o you would think
the Fiora would get hit by that that's
okay that was a
fail oh
 I got to get the minions though all
right we're good we're
good o I can actually almost get my uh
rabbit onry
awesome I'm almost at
it I think I could take I mean red
should be healing me I think I should
just take this and I'll have plenty of
gold never mind we're good
now
okay very cool
okay all right dude let's get
this there we go now we're good now
we're good let's get the rabadons we are
going to be juicing up our Squall a ton
how much does this let me see how much
this thing uh scales with ap 30%
AP not bad yeah so I think the nice
thing about squall is it or sorry storm
surge is it has Magic Pen whereas uh
rocket Belt doesn't have that anymore so
Magic Pen flat magic pin early on with
flat AP is like it's pretty much
everything you want in a collie like you
don't you don't really care too much
about ability haste movement speed's
nice it's pretty much just those three
stats so to get those things so early
and then get
burst uh it's it's a good deal it's a
really nice
item
nice wel back to the dark side hey
what's up thank you happy to be here
spicy okay sorry stream I um I'm
recording right now so I'm trying to
focus on just commentating oh I'm going
to take more damage can't
St okay that was a really really stupid
idea I understand but I also did just
like pretty much one shot Swain imagine
if we had a MAG
eyes okay I actually didn't realize we
were only 18 minutes
in I'm a okay I'm a lot more fit than I
thought I
was nice
cool yeah hell yeah um yeah we're owning
these
Bots okay 0 11 yeah apparently by the
way haunting guys I thought I say you
haunting guys apparently you can get six
of them and they
stack I'm not sure if 36% increased
damage is good without any other stats
but if it is you never know I mean like
if there's a champion that did flat
damage has that's AP and like doesn't
scale very well I could see something
like that being like really really
good they steal
that
ooh a nice try nice try good steal
though
damn
oh my
God yeah I don't know what Ash is doing
over there I feel like I feel like you
shouldn't be over there your team desty
thinking um nice let's see
Bluff
a ah I wish but I can't do that because
I will get ored to the face and I will
die for sure not just out of
this parkour
okay oh my God wait my storm search blew
up Echo oh right cuz if you get the
kill with storm surge it'll do this
giant AOE nuke that is awesome also
there's going to be mushrooms
everywhere I'm just kidding there's not
a single mushroom
anywhere damn that was
awesome awesome all right let's continue
on
dude we are so fat this game Jesus
Christ I actually think
if if our team was doing any worse we
could this could be a 50 kill game
that'd be so funny just add into like a
guide type
video how to get how to win every game
just go 50 and0 I'm just kidding
obviously there's like very clear steps
that lead into that and I think I think
the biggest thing is just
like it's two things right it's knowing
how to put yourself in those spots so
like when you have the lane lead or like
when you do more damage you take the
good trades and then the second thing is
like actually executing it and like
putting them into spots where like you
can kill them so like if you win level
six and you're about you're about to be
six like maybe freeze the
wave I got it here damn
it
I'm going to die I
think I don't like this one
bit I like this quite a bit oh my god
dude we are just yeah yeah we're to
Overkill and a half oh we have our we
have our last item as
well uh you like the new Mages Mage
feels broken I have not tested
everything yet I'm focusing on just a
for now cuz I want to really learn the
ins and outs of her in this season it's
been going pretty well so
far
okay all right it's looking
a well wait a second Fiora killed
Warwick this is uh this unheard
of unbelievable
able oh wait I'm actually Max build with
yeah it's good it's actually good she
took that cuz I have zero use for
that I beg you to take that for
us I feel like we could Penta but I also
know that Ash's ult is available and
Warwick is about to come back up so I'm
going to go ahead and not die hopefully
yeah it's a struggle H these mushrooms
are annoying see if I can get if I can
sweep some in the
way no one ever goes for
Dragon welcome back to leave Al yo I
love you first time catching you live
what's up way appreciate it man thank
you so much I'm happy to be
back okay yeah very happy back I hey
dude I'm so
unbelievably like surprised at how much
fun this season is I really needed I
think League really needed a change
after all these
years who he one shot that guy holy
tank
oh wait how am I the Last One Alive
please someone tell me how how did my
entire team die has been SL what like
what okay uh I want to get dragon I know
I could probably end but I'll be honest
with you at this point we could probably
get 50 kills in a game and I think
that'd be really really fun so we're
going to diverge from the the guide for
a
bit
there we go all right the question
is oh okay well the question is 18 Magic
Pen or anything else this gives us 12 12
okay it's not even close actually yeah
yeah yeah yeah all right so we have
1,57 AP our storm surge does 500 AOE
we're always going to PR it in AOE you
know that uh Lich Bane is going to do
600 electrocute is going to
do
300 and Cinder Bloom Shadow flame is
going to make everything crit for 30%
more 20% more I can honestly pent it
here but unfortunately it looks
like oh that's a way that is a good way
to get to 40 that is a good way to get
to 40 oh my my God they were just all in
us let's
go that was so crazy wait get Baron
Baron please close to
50 help me make my dream a reality first
time ever 50 kills not completely true
but I just want her to like help
me please I need I never got a Christmas
present I need a to make this dream a
reality initiate the Boss
music
uhoh
oh dear God we're
fine all right 115 AP no ocean soul h no
infernal Dragon dude I feel like our AP
is higher I think there might be more
overall AP
items I think rapid on used to give 30%
increase AP and now it's more L man used
to give 80 and now it's 100 and there's
more 120 instead of dude AP actually got
buffed pretty nice what the
heck oh my
God that's so
sad all right we need red although I
think they all have it yeah they all
have it that's fine
an I you know see the thing about Kaa is
I respect
that she's trying you know if your team
surender I'll die laughing it would not
be funny don't say
that that would be actually just the
most tragic
thing all right let's get rid of these
things no way I missed
that all right I got to go
back I'm once again too low to do
anything I I
just it's so sad we really don't have
any engage like we have a Lilia but
she's not going to hit a big b you know
like that's going to be pretty rare
that's a not reasonable thing oh
no oh no those are my kills get them Ash
kill
them oh
jeez
a what oh shoot I didn't ah the the
exhaust got me
good what is this attack
speed not the mushrooms man I actually
think if vorick just swapped on to kaisa
would have been completely fine where is
this item after casting your ultimate
gain attack speed and movement speed oh
that's really good for or
huh sell Magi and buy zonas does zonas
give up 120 holy
crap yeah you're
right
wow
Jesus okay that's actually a really good
idea yeah we're going to do that that so
we can I mean we don't have we get less
movement speed though but we get 5% 8%
so I think we have
plenty yeah we should be good 436
movement Speed without boots is uh
certainly plenty and um I'm surprised
ekko's bounty on me wasn't like 2,000
gold or
something
okay let's
see should get Soul as well
all right I want the enemy team to just
try to do
something that's all we need they need
to step out of their base there they are
let's do
it he going to blow up
right 1,800 ult damage holy crap that
guy is kind of tanky too we did 1,800
damage with our old wait that's um by
the way that's that's exactly like
that's that's pretty much all of teo's
Health in one
ability damn oh it's an execute though
so it doesn't
count that is for 44
kills
uhoh 45 kills let's go all righty GG
well played yes not much of a I mean at
a certain point became a stomp rather
than a guide but that was so much fun
and we got a pent kill so hell yeah that
was that was a great time
