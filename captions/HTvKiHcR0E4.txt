Hey everyone, welcome back to Switchtop.
Today I'm sharing the top 25 best AAA
games you should definitely play on your
Nintendo Switch in 2025. These games are
amazing and worth your time, even if
they've been out for a while. Let's jump
right in. The Legend of Zelda: Link's
Awakening is a beautiful remake of the
Game Boy classic where Link gets
shipwrecked on a mysterious island
called Caholand. The whole game takes
place on this island where you need to
wake up the Windfish to escape. You
explore the island, fight monsters in
real-time combat, and solve puzzles in
eight dungeons. The game uses a cute
toy-like art style that makes everything
look like miniature figures. What makes
this game special is how you collect
items like the hook shot, bow, and bombs
that help you reach new areas and beat
tough bosses. The dungeons are clever
and make you think. Plus, there's a
dungeon creator mode where you can make
your own challenges. If you love solving
puzzles and exploring every corner of
the map, this Zelda adventure is perfect
for you.
Xenolade Chronicles X Definitive Edition
brings the formerly Wii U exclusive
openw world RPG to Switch with major
improvements. The story follows humanity
escaping Earth's destruction on massive
spaceships with your ship crash landing
on planet Meera. You play as a
customizable character who joins Blade,
a group working to find other survivors
and set up a new home. What makes this
game amazing is the huge open world with
five different continents you can
explore freely filled with giant
creatures and beautiful scenery. The
combat happens in real time where you
position yourself to use special attacks
called arts with cool down timers. About
halfway through the game, you get your
own giant robot called a skele that can
transform into a vehicle and even fly
across the entire planet. The definitive
edition fixes the small text problems
from the original and adds quality of
life improvements to make exploring more
fun. If you love sci-fi worlds with tons
to discover, this is your game. Open
fire. Follow me.
Target inside.
Shadows hammer. Nice. Move in and do
some damage. Flame grenade.
Fire Emblem. Three Houses mixes tactical
battles with school life. You play as a
professor at a military academy with
three houses like Harry Potter. And you
must choose one to teach. Your story
changes based on which house you pick.
The game has two main parts. School
life, where you teach students, build
relationships, and improve their skills.
Then tactical battles, where you command
your students on a grid-based map.
During battles, you move characters like
chest pieces, considering their
strengths and weaknesses against
different enemies. The weapon triangle
system is easy to understand. Swords
beat axes, axes beat lances, and lances
beat swords. Each student can be trained
in different classes like knight,
archer, or mage, giving you lots of team
options. The story deals with themes of
war, friendship, and making tough
choices without a clear right answer.
Is that

all? Kirby and the Forgotten Land is
Kirby's first real 3D adventure, and
it's super fun. The story begins when
Kirby gets sucked into a mysterious
portal and lands in a world with
abandoned shopping malls, amusement
parks, and cities being taken over by
nature. Kirby needs to save the Wadd D's
who've been kidnapped by the Beast Pack.
The main thing that makes Kirby special
is his copy ability. He can inhale
enemies and steal their powers. You can
become Fire Kirby, Sword Kirby, Ice
Kirby, and more. This game also adds a
new mouthful mode where Kirby stretches
his body around objects like cars,
vending machines, and traffic cones to
use them in creative ways. The levels
are designed with secrets and hidden
waddled D's to rescue, and there's a hub
town that grows as you rescue more
friends.
Xenolade Chronicles 3 tells the story of
two nations, Caves and Agnes, locked in
a neverending war where soldiers only
live for 10 years. You follow Noah and
Mio from opposite sides who along with
their friends discover they can fuse
together into powerful beings called
Ouroros. The combat happens in real time
where you autoattack while moving around
to position yourself for special moves
called arts. What makes the battle
system deep is how you can switch
between classes, learning skills from
different roles like attacker, defender,
and healer. The fusion system lets two
characters combine into a super powerful
form with special moves and abilities.
The world is huge with breathtaking
landscapes like giant forests with trees
the size of skyscrapers and fields with
robot remains from ancient wars. As you
explore, you'll find colonies to free
from the war cycle and side quests that
tell small human stories within the big
conflict.

Dragon Quest 11S brings the classic JRPG
series to Switch with both modern 3D
graphics and optional 2D sprite-based
visuals. You play as the Luminary, a
hero chosen by Destiny, who must gather
allies and save the world from the evil
Dark One. The turn-based combat is easy
to understand. You take turns picking
actions like attack, magic, or item use
from menus. What makes the battle system
interesting is how you can switch
between normal fighting and an auto
battle system that uses AI tactics you
set up. As you level up, you spend skill
points on different weapon types and
abilities, allowing you to customize
your hero's fighting style. The world is
colorful and filled with distinctive
monsters designed by Dragon Ball creator
Akira Toriyama. From cute slimes to
fearsome dragons, you travel with a
group of unique characters who each have
their own personal stories to discover.
The S version adds extra story content,
full voice acting, a fantastic
orchestrated soundtrack, and a special
mode where you revisit locations from
older Dragon Quest games.

Monster Hunter Rise takes the monster
hunting action to a Japanese inspired
world called Kamura Village, which faces
a dangerous rampage of monsters. As a
hunter, you need to defend the village
and figure out what's causing these
strange monster attacks. The gameplay
loop is simple but addictive. Hunt
monsters, collect materials from them,
craft better weapons and armor, then
hunt stronger monsters. There are 14
different weapon types that all play
completely differently. From the fast
dual blades to the explosive switch axe
to the musical hunting horn. What makes
Rise special is the new wire bug system
that lets you zip through the air, run
up walls, and do special silkbind
attacks. You also get a doglike palamute
companion. You can ride around the map
and a cat-like palico helper who
supports you in battle. The game has
both a single player village quest line
and multiplayer hub quests where up to
four players can team up to take down
giant monsters together.
Impressive.
Persona 5 Royal follows a group of high
school students who discover they can
enter a strange world made from people's
distorted desires. You play as a
transfer student who moves to Tokyo
after being falsely accused of a crime.
Soon you discover you have the power to
become a phantom thief who can change
the hearts of corrupt adults. What makes
this game special is how it balances two
different parts. The real world, where
you go to school, hang out with friends,
study for exams, and work part-time
jobs. And the metaverse, where you
explore mind palaces and fight shadow
monsters in turn-based battles. Everyday
matters as you decide how to spend your
time, building relationships with
friends, called confidants, that give
you benefits in battle. The combat
system lets you use personas, monsters
that represent your inner self with
different elemental powers and
weaknesses.

globe trotting adventure to save
Princess Peach from Bowser, who plans to
force her into marriage. Mario teams up
with Cappy, a living hat who lets him
capture enemies and objects by throwing
his hat onto them. This capture ability
is the game's big new mechanic. You can
become a gloomba to walk in groups, a
frog to jump super high, a T-Rex to
smash through rocks, or even a zipper to
open new paths. The game features many
different kingdoms to explore from the
food themed Lunchon Kingdom to the urban
New Donk City. Each kingdom is packed
with power moons to collect, over 800
total that power your ship, the Odyssey.
Unlike older 3D Mario games that had
separate levels, each kingdom is one big
area to explore freely with secrets
hidden everywhere. The controls are
super smooth, letting Mario roll, jump,
and throw Cappy in many creative ways.

to its name as the ultimate crossover
fighting game with over 80 playable
characters from Nintendo and other game
companies. The basic idea is simple.
Fight other players on various stages
and try to knock them off the screen.
Instead of a health bar, damage
increases your percentage, making you
fly farther when hit. What makes Smash
special is how easy it is to pick up.
Just use the control stick and a few
buttons. but how much depth it has for
skilled players. Every fighter has their

classic GameCube game to Switch with
updated graphics and controls. You play
as Samus Aaron, a bounty hunter who
lands on planet Talon 4 after tracking a
distress signal. The game is played in
first-person view, but it's not a
regular shooter. It's more about
exploration and solving puzzles. You
move through different areas like lava
zones, ice caverns, and ancient ruins,
scanning objects to learn about the
world, and finding powerups that let you
reach new places. Your suit gets
upgrades like the morph ball to roll
through tight spaces, the grapple beam
to swing across gaps, and different
weapon beams for fighting enemies and
solving puzzles. The game doesn't tell
you exactly where to go next. You need
to explore and figure things out on your
own, making each new discovery feel
rewarding. Bayonetta 3 continues the
action-packed adventures of the stylish
witch Bayonetta as she fights against a
new threat called Homunculi. mysterious
beings destroying multiple worlds. The
combat is fast and flashy, letting you
string together punches, kicks, and
gunshots into amazing combos. What makes
Bayonetta special is witch time. When
you dodge an attack at just the right
moment, time slows down for enemies
while you can attack freely. New to this
game is the demon slave ability, which
lets you directly control the giant
demons Bayonetta usually summons for
finishing moves. These demons have their
own unique attacks and abilities, adding
a whole new layer to fights. The game
also introduces a new playable character
named Biola, who uses a sword and has
different abilities than Bayonetta.

saloons, catch bounties, break wild
horses, and meet strange characters with
their own stories.
Not bad, Marston.

back with a magical twist that totally
changes how these games feel. Mario and
friends visit the Flower Kingdom where
special wonderflowers transform levels
in completely surprising ways. Pipes
might grow legs and walk
away. Mario could turn into a gloomba.
The music might
change or gravity could flip. These
wonder moments make every level exciting
because you never know what will happen
next.
The controls are simple. Run and jump.
But new power-ups add fun options like
the elephant form that lets you use your
trunk to smash blocks and spray water.
The new badge system is also cool.

special ability like floating longer,
starting with a power up, or doing a
super jump off walls. You can play as
Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Toad, or
even Yoshi, each with slightly different

weakness, they get extra turns instead.
What makes this game unique is the demon
negotiation system. Instead of just
fighting demons, you can talk to them,
answer their questions, and convince
them to join your team. You can then
fuse demons together to create stronger
ones with different skills. The
Vengeance version adds a new storyline
path, new areas to explore, and quality
of life improvements.

brother in a haunted hotel where he must
rescue Mario Peach and the Toads after
they're kidnapped by ghosts. Each floor
of the hotel has a different theme.

blow air, and interact with the
environment. To catch ghosts, you first

tracks go vertical or upside down, and
bumping into other racers gives you a
speed boost. The game has different
control options for all skill levels.

the track, while experienced players can

boosting and item strategies. The battle
mode offers different games like balloon

2B, 9S, and A2 fighting a war against
machine life forms on a post-apocalyptic
Earth where humans have fled to the
moon. The game play seamlessly switches
between different styles. Most of the
time, it's a fast-paced action game
where you fight with swords and dodge
attacks, but sometimes it changes to a
top-own shooter, a sidescrolling
platformer, or even a text adventure.
Combat feels great as you switch between
light and heavy attacks while your
floating pod assistant provides range
support. You can customize your
abilities with plug-in chips that give
effects like health regeneration, attack
boosts, or completely changing the
game's interface. The open world is
hauntingly beautiful with nature
reclaiming ruined cities and deserts

legion for riding and tracking, and the

design. He can fold into a paper
airplane to glide across gaps, roll into
a tube to fit through pipes, or turn
sideways to slip through narrow spaces.

the battle.

Dark Souls Remastered brings the
famously challenging action RPG to
Switch. The story is mysterious. You're
an undead trying to figure out your
purpose in the dying world of Lordren,
where most people have gone hollow like
zombies. The game doesn't explain much
directly. You learn about the world
through item descriptions, rare
conversations, and the environment
itself. Combat is deliberate and
tactical. You need to manage your
stamina while attacking, blocking, and
dodging. Every enemy can be dangerous if
you get careless, and boss fights
require you to learn patterns and find
the right moments to attack. The world
design is amazing. Areas connect in
surprising ways with shortcuts you
unlock that make traveling easier. You
collect souls from defeated enemies to
level up your stats and strengthen your
character.
Doom Eternal puts you in the armor of
the Dooms Slayer. Humanity's last hope
against a demon invasion that has nearly
destroyed Earth. This first person
shooter is all about fast movement and
aggressive combat. Standing still means
death. The combat loop makes the game
unique. You get health by doing close-up
glory kills on stunned demons, armor by
burning enemies with your flamethrower,
and ammo by cutting demons with your
chainsaw. This forces you to constantly
move, switch weapons, and dive into
danger instead of hiding behind cover.
Each demon type has specific weaknesses.
Shoot the Revenant's shoulder cannons,
toss a grenade in the kaka demon's
mouth, or use the plasma rifle to break
the shield guy's defenses. The
platforming between fights has you
swinging from bars, dashing through the
air, and climbing
walls. Unicorn Overlord is a fresh
tactical RPG where you play as Alen, a
prince fighting to take back his kingdom
from the evil Zenoiran Empire. What
makes this game special is how it blends
classic tactical gameplay with modern
features. Instead of moving individual
units on a grid, you lead small armies
that move on a large map like pieces on
a board. When armies clash, battles play
out semi-automatically. You set up your
formation and special moves beforehand.
Then watch your troops execute your
strategy while activating special
abilities at key moments. Your army is
made up of different unit types like
knights, mages, and archers that form
relationships as they fight together,
unlocking powerful combo attacks.
Outside of battles, you liberate towns
to build your reputation. Recruit over
60 unique characters and make choices
that affect the story.
It's up to you. I shall protect you.
