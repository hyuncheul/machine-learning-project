You know, Digimon... (Talking about Digimon)  
Up to Power Digimon, it was kind of  
the real deal, you know?  
The story kind of continues until then  
Digimon Adventure and Power Digimon  
After that...  
It started showing Digimon I've never heard of, so I quit watching  
I used to enjoy it back then  
I don’t really remember, but my parents...  
My mom, specifically...  
When Digimon aired back in the day...  
She used to record it on tapes  
When it was on TV  
If she didn’t record it?  
Apparently I would totally freak out  
LOL  
So whenever Digimon aired  
Mom had to rush home  
Like, “If I don’t record this on tape...”  
“My kid's gonna lose it”  
Apparently that’s what happened  
Though I don’t really remember...  
Back in the day, with tapes...  
Didn’t we rent movies and stuff too?  
I think we used VHS a lot  
When we were kids?  
Yeah, there were lots of rental shops back then  
Probably all gone nowadays though  
If Lee Sin and Darius appear together...  
It must be top Darius, right?  
Why do I find Darius so...  
just annoying to look at?  
LOL  
Syndra...  
Hmm...  
Syndra, huh...  
Kassadin?  
Should I try Dark Harvest Kassadin?  
Wanna go full burst Kassadin for a change?  
"What's better than Arcane Comet or Conqueror?"  
Well, that's something we'll think about later, right?
Haha
I mean...
I'll leave that as homework for you all!
Figure out what's better than Arcane Comet or Conqueror~
Yeah, find the answer by next time, okay?
But like... a month or two ago?
Domination runes — the main ones —
they all got buffed quite a bit
So Dark Harvest Kassadin might actually be good
Been a while though
Maybe I should've just taken Conqueror?
Lmao
But hey, it's Ezreal Karma,
so it's not bad, right?
As long as we get through lane safely
Got 3 minions
Dodged her Q~
So now, up to level 6...
What’s the picture here?
Take a screenshot right now, because
this is exactly how it’s gonna be until level 6
LOL
“Wait, but you’re doing nothing right now?”
Exactly!
Just standing there getting hit by Qs
That’s how it’ll be all the way to 6
So take a screenshot and just...
put it on your screen or something?
It’ll be the same
Syndra might roam sometimes and disappear
Wow, she actually landed that?
That was clean
Ah... that was close
So close, damn
That really was unlucky
Nice
On my way
Would’ve been a shame if we missed that
Yummy
Not a bad trade, considering the HP difference.
So close...
Just a bit unfortunate...
Oh... everyone's dead.
Whew, thank god.
Lee Sin no ult.
Someone's gotta come!
Ah, you still had Flash?
That was such a shame.
Should've played it a bit more patiently, right?
Let's go in once I hit level 11 and Flash is up.
If I see an opening, I'll go for it.
But don't overdo it.
Lee Sin's missing too.
I gotta be the rational one here.
Let's try something here at least?
Wait, I didn’t get a single shutdown gold?
Good.
Now it's doable, right?
I got a lot of kills now, yeah?
Dark Seal...
Suddenly 10 stacks. Legendary.
So juicy...
Kinda wanna build Shadowflame now.
How much is it again? 2800 gold?
Should I go Stormsurge instead?
Yeah, let's go Stormsurge first, then Shadowflame.
Top’s kinda doomed, though?
I’m on my way.
Good.
Nice!
Kinda tempted to get Mejai’s, right?
I mean, I’ve got 1400 gold left—come on.
Ah… this is...
It's hard to resist.
Can’t hold it in.
Let’s just buy it first.
“What if you get popped?”
Just sell it.
LOL
Sell it...
Quit studying and look for something else.
Is studying too hard?
Yeah, then just find something else to do.
Studying isn't everything.
So close...
Guys, I’m just gonna push this, okay?
No need to rush anything.
Can’t we just take this too?
I do have Teleport...
You gonna engage?
If you are, I'm going in!
Did we get a lot of honeyfruits?
Feels like we could’ve done better, huh?
But the enemy couldn’t take the dragon anyway.
If Atakan only got Ruin...
It doesn’t really mean much.
Survive and win 10 million won!
Ah, the 10 million won challenge!
That was so close...
Darius?
You survive and win 10 million too!
He kinda deserved to die tho.
LOL
Why is Darius so strong?
I almost had to pay 10 million!
Now this is a headache for the enemy, right?
Everyone except me is AD now,
Only Kassadin’s doing AP...
And he’s scaling this well?
That’s gotta be tilting.
Don’t overextend here, no matter what.
Syndra's missing, right?
Wait, I see her.
Hey Nafiri, over here!
Nice~
22 stacks on Mejai’s...
Current AP? 489.
Who in the world can stop me now...
Never go 1v1 against Darius...
You never know, right?
There might be someone behind.
Okay, got it...
Whoa... thank goodness!
Wait a sec...
Why is he so strong...?
Man... I shouldn’t have 1v1'd Darius...
Did we win?
If we won, that’s all that matters.
But with 15 stacks...
It's not expulsion yet,
More like academic probation~
LOL
It’s not like I got kicked out of school.
Still plenty of time to study!
If I just focus and work hard from now on,
I'm still in the safe zone~
This much is fine.
Alright, 19 stacks now~
Ah, okay...
Okay, okay, I get it!
LOL
They acknowledged and backed off~
Uh.. spare me, spare me
If we go in now, it's just...
forcing it too hard.
Never dive in with your ult...
Wait, is Darius building MR?
What the— Darius! You’re not even building armor...
There’s only 1 AP and you’re buying MR?
WOW
Legendary damage just now.
Should I just flash for that?
Why are you even trying to live?
Die!
Guys, I really want to buy Rabadon’s!
Can I go grab my item?
I’m just buying it!
AP? 864. Insane.
On my way.
Okay~ this is it.
Good game.
Seriously, that’s it~
LOL
Sorry, sorry.
I’m sorry my AP is 864.
Oh, sorry, sorry.
I'll just end it.
Good game.
Nice.
Ah...
That’s unfortunate~
Yasuo!
“Can I pick late?”
Should I ask?
“Thank you.”
Hey, if Kassadin's open, let me pick him.
Is it okay if I play Kassadin?
Team comp looks fine!
Before they reply? Just lock it in!
Good luck.
Wait, who are they playing?
Top Zac?
Full AP Kassadin?
Should I go full AP Kassadin again?
Ah whatever, let’s do another full AP game.
That was fun.
If I lose, well, that’s that~
“Is Kassadin okay against Yasuo?”
Honestly, seeing Zac and Yasuo...
I probably should’ve taken Conqueror.
I’m regretting it right now(?)
LOL
Yeah, I’m honestly regretting it.
Wow... Yasuo’s nickname though—
“No Regrets”
Got it!
Another life lesson unlocked.
No regrets...
Wait what? Top Evelynn?!
The nickname is "Is this really top lane..."
Oh, it’s MakNooN? Really?
But hasn’t he always played top Evelynn?
He's been doing that since way back, right?
Nice~
Whoa, that was close.
Uh...
Did he lose his mind?
LOL what the...
Dude, what are you doing?
I thought that Yasuo was full build for a sec...
What is this guy?
Even Pz ZZang couldn’t carry that.
But honestly, if it was Pz ZZang,
he wouldn’t have even made that play.
“If it were Pz ZZang, he would’ve killed Kassadin at level 2.”
Would’ve been 0/2 already...
Hup-cha~
Well played!
Let’s just take this coolly, yeah?
It was a mistake.
I’m the type to admit mistakes, chill.
Okay...
Not bad.
Oh!
Man, if that was Pz ZZang...
That was 100% a kill. Right?
It barely clipped him.
Top lane is having a hard time, huh?
Wow, that damage...
Dude this is legendary!
What was that?
Evelynn is broken!
"Didn’t expect her to hit that hard, my bad lol"
"As expected from MakNooN!"
LOL
Classic MakNooN!
But seriously...
They totally underestimated Kassadin.
Uh-oh..! My bad~
Nice one.
I didn’t think I’d push all the way here.
I kind of missed my ult just now too...
Could’ve gone bad.
But hey, the result turned out great?
Maybe Archangel’s is the better choice here?
Or maybe not?
Ah, whatever~
Who cares, who cares...
Full AP, let’s go~!
Not bad.
Huh?
Ah...
This is full alert, isn’t it?
Uhh...
Just shut down communication!
Mood's not good, right?
Who’s saying “just FF” already?
This isn’t too bad though, right?
Better recall before heading out.
Ashe no ult.
Nice~
That was a solid play, right?
That was good~
Man, that was really close just now.
But Evelynn has three completed items...
She’s gonna be really strong in 1v1s.
Can I even win that?
I probably need level 16 to beat her.
I don't even have any MR items either.
Okay~
I don’t think I’ll lose this?
Looking at the damage output?
Oh yeah, this looks winnable!
Delicious...
This one’s irresistible!
You HAVE to buy this!
Not buying this should be illegal~
Wait! Ahh—
Ah...
Just sell it right away?
LOL
Shouldn't have overextended...
Oh, nice~
Not bad?
As long as we won, it's fine!
LOL
Yeah, a win's a win~
And my Mejai’s…
People probably forgot I bought it by now?
What do I build next?
Huh?
Nice!
But after that moment...
The enemy might start paying less attention to Kassadin
Like now?
So if level 16 Kassadin pops off again?
That could actually be great~
Since I died doing nothing just now
They might think I’m not a threat
Might underestimate me
Sorry sorry sorry
(Uhm...)
Wait, Zac...
...Did we win?
Did we?
If we did, then we’re good!
LOL
That was a good engage... right?
Uh...
Yeah it was solid! That was good
Wait... LOL
What is this?
Never seen that play before!
Going opposite directions like that...
That’s creative
Wasn’t that a bit too bold?
Hey, Lulu!
I thought you were Malphite for a sec!
LOL
Wait, what...
That was good! Seriously!
You had that performance moment!
That was stylish, right?
Lulu froze...
Alright, gg
But I couldn't really teamfight in the end...
So my damage probably isn’t high, right?
We barely had any teamfights
So that's a bit unfortunate
Mid Yasuo, jungle Diana...
Top is probably Darius, or maybe not?
If Yasuo’s top,
he wouldn’t have been picked first, right?
So Darius is probably...
Yeah, top lane
In my champion pool,
This is all I got…
Sudden Impact?
Or maybe I should go Nimbus Cloak too since Darius probably will?
Should I take it too?
Feels like the right move?
Top lane Press the Attack Darius, legend...
If he hadn’t procced it, I would’ve won that trade
Diana’s heading top now...
But I’ve got Ghost, so whatever
Sorry
My bad, my bad
Sorry for dancing around you
But Darius went in way too fast
So yeah, lane’s doomed now
Lane’s screwed
LOL
Yeah, sorry. Lane’s totally doomed
If Diana comes, I’m dead
If Diana’s gonna come,
She needs to wait a bit more, right?
Oh, she’s here?
If she’s waiting,
She should be waiting here
She just took the Rift Scuttler.
And waited here the whole time?
She didn't even counter-jungle or anything.
Well, now maybe she can, but still.
If I try to stop the invade,
I might get into some real trouble.
OK.
Hup!
Nice job!
Hey, I did everything I needed to.
Right?
Yo, Diana’s mad!
She’s totally pissed!
Guys! Diana’s tilted hard!
So what?
You’re the one who came top.
Now Diana and Darius are probably just
mad at each other at this point.
LOL
They should’ve played better.
Darius probably hates the world right now,
and Diana just hates Darius.
They’re probably both just done.
Seriously, people who first-pick Darius...
They should play something like Vayne~
No sense of honor with those champs.
Nice job.
Yup~
Who told you to first-pick Darius!
Honestly, when you play Vayne...
and you're hitting someone like Ornn,
you do feel a bit guilty.
But against Darius?
Not even a little bit.
LOL
They just picked him to have some fun too~
So they deserve the pain(?)
Or not. Whatever.
Diana's never coming top again, huh?
Ever since what happened at the start...
She hasn't path toward top even once.
LOL
Sorry, sorry.
Actually, I’m not sorry.
Sorry, sorry.
But to you? Not really.
The scary part?
Diana got upset at Darius early on.
Even if the inhibitor turret is going down,
she's never coming top again.
Like, no matter what.
Seriously..
I don’t know anymore.
He’s kinda just hitting Ornn now.
It’s come to that?
He’s gone 0/7/0…
“I just realized Darius is 0/7/0.”
Teemo thumbs up for that...
Sorry, Darius!
I didn’t mean to go *that* hard...
Sorry, sorry.
He ran away in the end...
LOL
He really left, huh.
Huh?
Bit deep, huh?
Darius, I don’t have any summoners left!
Let’s go for a real 1v1!
You have everything up though.
Without spells? I could actually win!
You’ve even got Nimbus Cloak.
He's just... mentally broken now.
Uh...
He doesn't even want to fight anymore.
Yup, it’s Blade of the Ruined King.
Hey there.
Darius is 0/8/0...
Isn’t that report-worthy?
Now he’s 0/9/0!
LOL
No way...
I don't even know anymore...
If I were Darius, where would I go...
Wouldn't he just slowly walk top?
Is there a ward here?
No ward for now~
Hmm.. yeah, yeah
You had no other place to go anyway
Sorry, sorry—just one more time, okay?
Ah, I'm sorry!
Let me kill you just one more time!
Thanks, buddy!
0/10/0...
LOL seriously...
I haven’t seen a 0/10/0 in a while
But Smolder is still...
hanging onto hope, you know?
Sorry
Actually...
I wanted to get into Seoul National University
LOL
I gotta be a top scorer, right?
I at least need one death to qualify!
You can’t get in if you don’t even take the exam
Time to go to SNU
But if I die to Yasuo one more time?
The mood will get real cold from that point
Up until now it's been...
“Haha, look—Vayne died again~”
“Come on buddy, focus up~” kind of vibe
But if I die one more time?
“…Hmm.”
LOL
You know what I mean, right?
Hmm...
Darius behavior!
He’s not gonna teamfight anyway
So he just pushes this lane forever
Oh, sorry, sorry!
Just one more time, okay?
LOL
Let’s go for 11 deaths, Darius!
Nice to see you again!
Sorry, sorry
My bad, my bad
Bye now!
Guys, but think about it
This is a 12-kill Vayne
Honestly now...
Even if it wasn’t me...
Even if I were a 0/0/0 Vayne
Wouldn’t we still win?
Because to be honest...
All I did was kill Darius
I think the rest of them just lost a 4v4 below or something?
GG
Darius is gonna type that thing now~
LOL
“I understand.”
Like... “I will win with my team.”
He’s totally gonna type that...
What are we gonna do with this guy
Man... LOL
Sorry about that!
