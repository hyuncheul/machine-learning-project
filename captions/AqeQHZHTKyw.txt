you'll try it
out additionally game chat supports the
Nintendo switch parental controls app
and different settings can be adjusted
for example whether parental permission
is always required when a child wants to
use game chat to play with their
friends we'd like to introduce another
new experience you can share with family
and
friends on Nintendo switch even if you
just have one game you can pass a
joy-con controller to a friend and play
together but on Nintendo switch 2 you
can play together locally on multiple
systems using just one game with game
share as shown here even games that
require multiple screens can be played
if one person owns a compatible game
with game share you can temporarily
share compatible games with others who
also have Nintendo switch 2 or a
Nintendo switch system you can share a
game with up to three other systems at a
time game share also supports online
play with other switch 2 systems and you
can use it with friends via game chat

icons here let's examine
them this sign reads where are the
magnets the joyon 2 controllers attach
to the system with magnets and those
magnets are inside the
system the SL and Sr buttons on the
joycon 2 are made of
metal so that's how they attach to the
system a magnetic circuit is formed
between them so they won't easily detach
[Music]

can discover all sorts of secrets about
Nintendo switch 2 another example the
joy-con 2 controllers have Mouse
controls and when combined with the
gyroscopes you can even do something

golf club and aim for the Cup by
rotating the joycon
