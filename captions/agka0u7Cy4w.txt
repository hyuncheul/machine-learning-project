Hey Switch fans, welcome back to
Switchtop. Today we're checking out the
absolute best new games that hit the
Nintendo Switch in 2025. These games are
fresh, fun, and definitely worth your
time and money. I've played them all and
picked my top 20 favorites that you
should definitely try. Let's jump right
in. Phantom Breaker Battlegrounds
Ultimate brings super fun beat them up
action with cute chibi anime characters
that have awesome fighting moves. The
story follows a group of fighters
trapped in a mysterious tournament by a
villain called Phantom, and they must
battle through different parts of Tokyo
to escape. What makes this game special
is how it mixes old school sidescrolling
fighting with RPG elements. You level up
your character, unlock new moves, and
customize your fighting style. You can
choose from 20 different characters,
each with their own unique attacks and
special moves. The controls are super
easy to pick up. Just a few buttons for
attack, jump, and special moves, but you
can pull off some really cool combos
when you get good. The four-player co-op
mode lets you and your friends team up
to beat tough bosses together. And
there's also a versus mode when you want
to fight against each other.

Tales of Iron, Two Whiskers of Winter
continues the adventure of rat warriors
in a beautiful handdrawn world that
feels like you're playing inside a story
book. In this sequel, you play as a new
rat hero who must save their kingdom
from an invasion of evil frogs during a
harsh winter. The game plays like a 2D
action RPG where timing your attacks,
blocks, and dodges is super important.
It's challenging, but feels amazing when
you get good at it. You'll collect
different weapons like swords, spears,
and hammers that all feel different when
you fight with them. The cooking system
lets you make meals that give you
helpful boosts during tough fights. As
you explore the Snowy Rat Kingdom,
you'll upgrade your armor, help
villagers with their problems, and
uncover secrets hidden in the
beautifully detailed environments.

Hello Kitty Island Adventure brings
Sanrio's adorable characters to a
colorful island where friendship and
creativity are what it's all about. You
create your own character and explore
Big Adventures Island alongside Hello
Kitty, Cinemoral, Komi, and other Sanrio
friends. The game works like a relaxing
life sim where you build and decorate
your dream home. Help island residents
with their problems and unlock new areas
to explore. The crafting system lets you
gather materials around the island to
make cute furniture, clothes, and gifts
for your new friends. The more gifts you
give, the closer you become. There are
tons of mini games like fishing, bug
catching, and boat racing that keep
things fun.

Lunar Remastered Collection brings two
classic RPGs from the 1990s. Lunar
Silverstar Story and Lunar Eternal Blue
to the Switch with beautiful updated
graphics while keeping all the charm of
the originals. These games tell epic
stories about heroes with big dreams who
end up saving their world from ancient
evils. The battle system is turnbased
but with a twist. Position matters.
Where your characters stand affects
their attacks and who gets targeted by
enemies. You'll lead a party of unique
characters through colorful towns and
dangerous dungeons, solving puzzles and
finding treasure along the way. What
made these games famous was their
amazing storytelling with fully animated
cutscenes and voice acting, which was
super rare back in the '90s.

Star Overdrive is a stylish, fast-paced
sci-fi action adventure game for
Nintendo Switch that blends hoverboard
traversal, combat, and exploration in a
beautifully crafted alien world. You
play as Bios, a mysterious protagonist
searching for his lost friend nose on
the vibrant planet of Sabete. Armed with
a customizable hoverboard and a kear
that doubles as a weapon and puzzle
solving tool, Bios traverses four unique
biomes filled with ruins, environmental
puzzles, hidden secrets, and hostile
creatures. The hoverboard mechanics
allow for trick combos and smooth
navigation. While the kear unleashes
powerful attacks and manipulates the
environment in creative ways. With its
cell-shaded visuals and punk infused
soundtrack, the game evokes the style of
jetet radio while embracing the freedom
and scale of Breath of the Wild.
Leica, Aged Through Blood, tells the
emotional story of a mother coyote
seeking revenge in a western world where
animals ride motorcycles instead of
horses. After her tribe is attacked and
her pup kidnapped, Leica grabs her
shotgun and hops on her bike for a
journey across a harsh desert landscape.
The gameplay is what developers call a
Motor Vania, like a Metroid Vania game,
but on a motorcycle. You'll pop wheelies
to jump over obstacles, perform tricks
to dodge bullets, and use your momentum
to reach new areas. The combat feels
awesome as you shoot from your bike
while pulling off stunts with a unique
blood meter that builds up when you take
risks and lets you perform powerful
special moves. As you explore the
handdrawn world, you'll find upgrade
parts for your bike that lets you access
previously blocked paths. The story
tackles themes of motherhood and revenge
without getting too complicated.

Urban Myth Dissolution Center puts you
in charge of a special agency that
investigates weird happenings around a
strange city. As a new agent, you'll get
reports of monsters, ghosts, and other
spooky stuff. Then go out to figure out
if they're real or just stories. What
makes this game super fun is how it
mixes detective work with turn-based
battles. You'll gather clues by talking
to witnesses, taking pictures, and
searching areas. Then sometimes fight
the actual monsters you find. Each urban
legend you investigate has multiple
possible endings depending on what
evidence you discover and what choices
you make. The battle system uses a deck
of action cards that you collect
throughout the game, letting you
customize your fighting style. The city
map changes at night when more dangerous
creatures come out, adding tension to
your

investigations. Symphonia lets you save
a magical world by playing music in this
beautiful rhythm adventure game. You
play as Melody, a young musician who
discovers she can bring color and life
back to a fading world by playing her
magical instrument. The gameplay
combines platforming with rhythm
challenges. You'll jump and explore like
in a regular platformer, but when you
encounter faded areas or creatures, you
play music by pressing buttons to the
beat to restore them. As you progress,
you'll learn new songs that give you
different powers like creating
platforms, moving objects, or revealing
hidden paths. The world has six distinct
areas based on different musical styles.
From orchestral forests to electronic
city ruins, each with their own visual
style and rhythm patterns. You'll meet
musical spirit companions who join your
journey and add new instruments to your
songs, making them more powerful.

Sugar Island invites players into a
heartwarming world where the goal is
simple but magical. Restore harmony to a
once thriving island disrupted by greed.
You'll plant crops, raise adorable
animals, and manage your own cozy farm
shop, selling goods to the charming
forest folk who call the island home.
There are no ticking clocks or looming
deadlines here. Just peaceful farming,
crafting, and questing at your own pace
as you complete tasks for the magical
harmony tree. New areas open up,
revealing even more surprises. You can
customize your character and your farm,
build friendships with the islanders,
and maybe even find a little romance
along the way. The game play focuses on
relaxation and creativity, though some
players might wish for deeper character
interactions. Still, Sugar Island
delivers an irresistibly wholesome
experience that's perfect for fans of
games like Animal Crossing and Stardew
Valley, offering a beautiful, low
pressure escape into nature and
imagination.
Galg Guardians Servants of the Dark has
an amazing blend of action platforming
and gothic style. This game stars twin
sisters Marissa and Meline who must
fight through a demoninfested castle
using different weapons and magical
abilities. What makes this game so good
is how it lets you instantly switch
between the sisters. Marissa uses
close-range attacks with her whip and
can climb walls, while Meline attacks
from a distance with her crossbow and
can double jump. The castle is huge with
six themed areas, each ending with an
epic boss fight against a demon lord. As
you explore, you'll find new abilities
like fire whips or freezing arrows that
not only help in combat, but also unlock
new paths through earlier areas. The
upgrade system uses soul shards
collected from defeated enemies to power
up your weapons and magic. The story
about the sister's missing parents keeps
you interested without too many
cutscenes interrupting the action.
Guilty Gear Strive finally brings one of
the coolest fighting games to Switch,
and it runs way better than anyone
expected. The story is about
superpowered fighters in a world where
magic and technology mix together, with
some characters trying to protect the
world, while others want to change it
completely. What makes this game awesome
is how flashy and exciting the fights
are. Even if you're new to fighting
games, each character feels totally
different. From the main guy, Soul, who
uses fire punches to the guitar playing
witch I know who attacks with sound
waves. The game has a special autocombo
system that lets beginners pull off cool
moves by pressing one button multiple
times, but there's still tons of depth
for serious players. The tutorials are
super helpful and actually teach you how
to play instead of just showing button
commands.
Modora: Moonlight Farewell is a
beautiful 2D action game that feels like
a mix between old school Castlevania and
modern platformers. You play as Momo, a
priestess with a magical leaf that she
uses as a weapon on a journey to save
her homeland from an evil curse. The
game is all about smooth combat where
timing matters. You'll attack with your
leaf, shoot arrows from a distance, and
use perfectly timed dodges to avoid
getting hit. When you dodge at just the
right moment, time slows down, and you
can counterattack for big damage. As you
explore the gorgeous pixel art world,
you'll find new abilities like a double
jump and a dash move that help you reach
new areas and discover hidden secrets.
The boss fights are a highlight. They're
challenging but fair with each boss
having clear patterns you can learn.
There's a cool bell system where
equipping different magical bells gives
you special powers like healing when you
attack or creating explosions when you
dodge.
All in Abyss. Judge the Fake is a super
unique game that mixes card battles with
detective work. You play as a judge in a
world where people settle disputes
through card games instead of court
cases. The story follows your character
as they uncover a conspiracy where
someone is using fake cards to cheat and
take over the city. The card game itself
is easy to learn but hard to master. You
play cards with different numbers and
symbols, and you have to create chains
of matching cards to perform powerful
combo moves. What makes this game
special is the detective parts between
card battles. You'll gather evidence,
question witnesses, and use deduction to
figure out who's creating the fake
cards. The game has an awesome judgment
system where you have to decide who's
telling the truth based on the evidence
you found. And your choices change how
the story unfolds.

Rusty Rabbit is a super charming
platformer about a robot rabbit trying
to save his forest home from pollution.
You play as Rusty, an old robot rabbit
who wakes up after many years to find
his forest being taken over by an evil
factory. The gameplay feels like classic
platformers, but with a cool twist.
Rusty can transform parts of his body to
get new abilities. You can change his
legs to bounce higher, his arms to grab
distant objects, or his head to scan for
hidden paths. The game has a beautiful
hand-drawn style that looks like a
children's book come to life with bright
colors and cute characters. Each level
has a different theme based on seasons.
Spring levels have growing plants you
can use as platforms, while winter
levels have slippery ice and snow piles
to jump into. There are lots of hidden
collectibles that tell the story of what
happened while Rusty was asleep.
[Music]
Let's
go. Biomorph is a creepy but awesome
action game where you can transform into
the monsters you defeat. You play as a
scientist who gets infected with a
strange virus that lets them absorb the
DNA of creatures they kill. The game is
a mix of exploration and combat. You'll
fight your way through a mysterious
facility that's been overrun by mutated
creatures. The coolest part is the
transformation system. After defeating a
monster, you can take on their form and
use their unique abilities. Some forms
let you climb walls, others let you
breathe underwater, and some give you
powerful attack moves. You'll need to
switch between different forms to solve
puzzles and reach new areas. The combat
feels great with dodging, parrying, and
combo attacks that change depending on
which form you're using. The game has a
creepy atmosphere with dark corridors
and eerie sounds, but it's more about
tension than jump
scares. Citizen Sleeper 2 Starward
Vector is a storyrich RPG where your
choices really matter. You play as a
sleeper, a digital consciousness in a
mechanical body who has escaped from the
corporation that owns them. The game
works like a mix between a visual novel
and a board game. Each day you roll
digital dice and assign them to
different actions like working jobs,
building relationships, or investigating
mysteries. Higher dice rolls give better
results, but sometimes you have to work
with what you get. The story takes place
on a fleet of ships traveling through
space with each ship having its own
community and problems to solve. What
makes this game special is how your
choices affect the story. Helping one
group might upset another, and the game
remembers your decisions throughout.
Your sleeper body slowly breaks down
over time, so you need to find ways to
repair yourself while also working
toward your goals.
Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is a
gorgeous action adventure game with a
unique soul-catching system. You play as
Lilac, a young girl with the power to
capture and use the souls of defeated
enemies. The game takes place in a
beautiful but dangerous world covered in
poisonous mist, where Lilac must find a
way to purify the land. The gameplay
combines smooth sword combat with the
ability to release captured souls to
perform special attacks. Fire souls can
burn obstacles. Water souls can grow
plants to climb on. And wind souls can
help you glide across gaps. As you
explore the handpainted world, you'll
find new equipment that changes how you
play, like a hook shot that lets you zip
to distant points or boots that let you
walk on walls briefly. The game has a
dayight cycle where different enemies
appear depending on the time, and the
mist gets thicker at night, making
exploration more dangerous.

Xenolade Chronicles X Definitive Edition
brings the epic sci-fi RPG to Switch
with improved graphics and quality of
life updates. The story follows humanity
after Earth is destroyed with the
survivors crash landing on an alien
planet called Meera. You create your own
character who joins Blade, a group
tasked with exploring the planet and
finding a missing part of their ship.
What makes this game amazing is the
massive open world. You can run, jump,
and swim across five huge continents
filled with alien creatures ranging from
tiny bugs to massive dinosaur-like
beasts. The combat happens in real time
where you autoattack while positioning
yourself to use special abilities with
cooldown timers. About 30 hours in, you
get access to skells, giant mechs that
transform into vehicles, letting you
drive, fly, and fight in them. The game
features tons of side quests that
develop the world and characters, and
many have multiple outcomes based on
your choices.

Yes. Now tackle it up. Suiciden 1 and 2
HD remaster brings two of the greatest
RPGs ever made to Switch with beautiful
updated graphics. Both games tell epic
stories about war, friendship, and
destiny where you play as heroes caught
in the middle of large-scale conflicts.
What makes these games special is the
108 Stars of Destiny system. In each
game, you can recruit up to 108
different characters to join your cause.
These characters don't just join your
battle party. Many help by opening
shops, upgrading your headquarters, or
providing useful services. The combat is
turn-based with six party members
instead of the usual four. And there are
epic army battles where you command
large forces in strategic conflicts. The
HD remaster adds gorgeous new background
art, redesigned character portraits, and
improved sound effects while keeping the
original gameplay intact. New quality of
life features include an auto battle
option, fast-forward function, and a
helpful marker that shows which
characters you've already recruited. The
games are connected with your choices in
the first game affecting certain events
in the second, and you can transfer your
save data between them.

The Hundred Line. Last Defense Academy
is a gripping tactical RPG and visual
novel hybrid where you play as Takumi
Samino, a seemingly ordinary student
suddenly drafted into a surreal battle
for survival. Alongside 14 other
students, you're enrolled in the
mysterious Last Defense Academy, where
your mission is to protect the school
for 100 days from terrifying invaders
using a supernatural power known as
Hemoanma. The game masterfully blends
turn-based strategy with branching story
paths, giving you the freedom to forge
relationships, train abilities, and
shape a narrative that can unfold in
over 100 different ways. With stylized
anime visuals by Rui Kamatsaki and an
atmospheric soundtrack by Masafumi
Takada, it delivers an emotionally

you to weigh your choices carefully.
It's a unique blend of tense tactical
combat and psychological storytelling
