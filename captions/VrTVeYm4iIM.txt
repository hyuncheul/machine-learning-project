Hello everyone. I'm Koichi Komoto and
I'll be one of your guides for today's
Nintendo
Direct. I'm the producer for Nintendo
Switch 2.
I'm Takuhiro Dota, the director for
Nintendo Switch
2. And I'm Tetsia Sasaki, the hardware
design lead for Nintendo Switch
2. What you just saw was Mario Kart
World, launching exclusively on Nintendo
Switch
2. Now, what do you think this brand new
Mario Kart game will be like?
[Music]
A brand new entry in the Mario Kart
series is launching exclusively on the
Nintendo Switch 2 system. Welcome to
this vast
world. Cart races are held throughout
various regions that span the
globe. Depending on the time of day and
weather conditions, the atmosphere will
change.
[Music]
And in this Mario Kart
game, you can go off the racetrack and
drive virtually everywhere in this
world. In the classic Grand Prix, race
through four courses in a bid for first
[Music]
place. But don't sleep at the wheel.
You'll also drive to the next course as
part of the competition.
With 24 drivers in each race, the most
in series history, the competition is
gearing
[Music]
up. Introducing Knockout
Tour. Race non-stop from one corner of
the world to
another. There are multiple checkpoints
along the way.
If you're below the placement shown when
you hit a checkpoint, you'll be
[Music]
eliminated. Can you make it all the way
to the finish
[Music]
line? You can also freely drive around
this vast world in free
[Music]
roam. By going off-road, you can explore
new areas and routes. So, drive wherever
your heart takes you.
You can also go for scenic drives with
friends and even take photos together at
different
[Music]
locations. A brand new race across the
entire world starts here.
Mario Kart
World. The game launches on the same day
as Nintendo Switch 2. More details about
this title will be shared in an upcoming
Mario Kart World Direct, so be on the
lookout for more information in the
future.
Mario Kart World launches on the same
day as Nintendo Switch 2.
We'll share more details in the future,
so we hope you're looking forward to it.
Next, we'd like to introduce some of the
new features of Nintendo Switch 2.
These are the Joy-Con 2 controllers for
Switch
[Music]
2. And on the right Joycon 2, we've
added a new C
button. Let's take a look at some new
experiences it offers.
[Music]
I'm still ahead of all of you guys.
[Music]
That was me. That was you. So quick.
Alexi. Oh,
no. You are tiny now. Wait. No. No. No.
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.
Nick, I'm coming for you. Come on. No.
Introducing Game Chat, a new feature for
Nintendo Switch 2. Hey, what's up? Can
you hear me? Hello. Hi. Missed you. With
this feature, you'll be able to
communicate with friends and family
while playing a game. Should we follow
you? Yeah. All right. Let's go. Okay.
For an
adventure. While using the game chat
feature, your voice is recognized by a
microphone built into the system. Oh,
okay. But you're still behind me, right?
All right, let's keep going. Okay. It
can pick up your speaking voice clearly,
even from a distance. Look at this. Jump
on here.
All right, let's keep going. Come. Let's
make a left right here. Let's make a
When it's noisy around you, your voice
will still come through clearly, letting
you chat with ease. How did you get hit
by a bow?
Okay, nice. Nice. It does look
beautiful.
And you can use this feature in handheld
mode, too, letting you easily chat with
friends and family.
If you open the chat menu and turn on
game screen sharing, great job. Good
job. There we go. There we go. You can
also share your game screen. Did you see
someone just like go on top of that
dinosaur? Really? They can do that? They
can do it. You guys, I just did it. Oh,
I want to do it, too. Oh, shoot. Oh. Oh,
he's trying to eat me. He's trying to
eat me. Okay, I got it. I got it. Oh,
no. No. No.
Bye. Yay.
Okay.
You can chat to your heart's content,
even while playing different games.
Yeah, I know that one. It's so hard,
right? It's tough. Oh, wow. I'm like in
the sky right here. I'm a I fell. I'm
falling. I'm falling. I'm falling. Okay,
we got it. We're safe. We're safe.
Kirby, look. You're a star. That's so
cute. So cute.
You can adjust the size of your game
screen.
Guys, I'm lost. Like, where'd you go?
Or expand another Friends game screen.
You got to get above above that uh wall
that's to your left. You're almost
there, though. It's just like the wall.
Like if she gets past the wall. This is
where I have to do a little wall ride.
Okay. Okay.
So, everyone can watch them play. Oh, I
think I I think I know where you are. I
think I know where you are. Wait, wait,
wait, wait. Okay. I think we have dry.
Ooh. Okay. Oh, nice. Let's take a
picture here. Okay. Are you ready?
Smile. Yay. Oh, yo, that's sick. I like
your pose, Meeks. On the right Joy-Con 2
controller, there's an additional
button. With the C button, you can pull
up a chat menu.
Oh, dang. A really, actually, guys, uh,
I got a call coming right now, so u I'll
be right back. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Here you can quickly and easily mute
yourself and more. And there's
this by connecting this camera to the
system.
Hey.
Hey. What's up?
Hello. Yo, Nick. Hi. How's everyone
doing? Good. You can appear on screen
and video chat while playing a game.
Seeing your faces on here. Wait, Nick,
how was your test yesterday? It's good.
Here's how it looks with just the camera
feed. I'm way behind, guys. There you
go. I bet you like that. Can you wait
for me? Please look forward to games
which use your camera feed like this.
No, no, wait. Go left. Left. Left. Go a
little more this way.
Using Game Chat, even when you're apart,
you can play games and hang out as if
you were together in the same room. Play
together or compete in online
multiplayer games.
Chat while playing your personal
favorites,
[Music]
decide your own rules for a retro game
competition or hold a sports competition
between families.
All together, anytime,
anywhere. Game chat.
What did you think? In developing Game
Chat, our goal was for you to enjoy
playing online with others more closely,
including family and friends, almost as
if you're all playing together in the
same place.
[Music]
The camera you saw in the trailer is the
Nintendo Switch 2
camera, which will be available on the
same day as Switch
2. A Nintendo Switch online membership
will be required to use Game
Chat. However, since we'd like as many
people as possible to experience Game
Chat, it will be available without a
membership for a limited time. We hope
you'll try it out.
Additionally, Game Chat supports the
Nintendo Switch parental controls app
and different settings can be adjusted.
For example, whether parental permission
is always required when a child wants to
use Game Chat to play with their
friends. We'd like to introduce another
new experience you can share with family
and friends.
[Music]
On Nintendo Switch, even if you just
have one game, you can pass a Joy-Con
controller to a friend and play
together. But on Nintendo Switch 2, you
can play together locally on multiple
systems using just one game. With Game
Share, as shown here, even games that
require multiple screens can be played
if one person owns a compatible game.
With GameS Share, you can temporarily
share compatible games with others who
also have Nintendo Switch 2 or a
Nintendo Switch system. You can share a
game with up to three other systems at a
time.
Game Share also supports online play
with other Switch 2 systems, and you can
use it with friends via Game Chat, which
we showed earlier.
Game Share can only be used with
compatible games. This feature is
planned for several titles, starting
with a free update for Clubhouse Games
51 Worldwide Classics on Nintendo
Switch. Game Share support is also
planned for select games exclusive to
Nintendo Switch 2, so we hope you'll
look forward to it.
Up next,
we'd like to show you the Nintendo
Switch 2 system itself.
Please take a
[Music]
look. At 7.9 in, Switch 2 has a bigger
built-in screen. Here's how that
compares to Nintendo Switch. The systems
thickness remains the same.
With approximately double the pixels
compared to Switch, you can enjoy games
in greater detail on the 1080p
[Music]
screen. The screen supports up to 120
frames per second, allowing for smoother
gameplay in supported titles.
The LCD screen is more vivid and
supports HDR, providing more contrast
between light and dark areas of the
images. The all-new Joycon 2 controllers
connect
magnetically. Strong magnets keep the
controllers firmly attached to the
system. Detach a controller easily by
pressing the release button on the back.
The SL and SR buttons are bigger for
greater comfort and control when playing
with a Joy-Con 2 held
[Music]
horizontally. The left and right sticks
are now
[Music]
larger. Each Joycon 2 controller can be
used as a mouse to play with compatible
games. Both the left and right Joycon 2
support mouse
controls. By adjusting the audio balance
between the ranges, sounds from the
built-in speakers are clearer and more
natural in handheld and tabletop
modes. It has a built-in microphone so
you can voice chat with friends anytime
via game chat.
It also uses noiseancelling technology
to filter sounds so your voice will come
through
clearly. Even if you don't have a
surround sound system, games can be
enjoyed with more immersive
three-dimensional sound as if it were
coming from all around you.
[Music]
Place your Nintendo Switch 2 however you
like. With a large, sturdy stand, you
can move it freely like
this. In addition to the USBC port found
on the bottom of the system, there's one
on top as well.
It's handy for connecting a USBC
camera or charging in tabletop
[Music]
mode. Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256
GB of internal storage, 8 times that of
Nintendo Switch for storing your game
downloads, save data, and more.
Reading and writing data is also
[Music]
faster. Use the Nintendo Switch 2 doc to
connect to your TV and enable up to 4K
resolution for compatible games. HDR is
also supported in TV mode.
The Nintendo Switch 2 Dock has a
built-in fan that keeps your system
cool. This helps keep performance
stable. On Nintendo Switch 2, you can
play Nintendo Switch 2 games as well as
compatible Nintendo Switch games.
Physical and digital games are
supported.
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
As you just saw, Nintendo Switch 2 isn't
simply an improved Nintendo
Switch. We redesigned the system from
the ground up and packed in lots of new
gameplay features.
And to help players better understand
the Switch 2 hardware, we're currently
developing this
game. Mr. Kawamoto,
hello. My current location is actually
inside the game
itself. This is Nintendo Switch 2
welcome tour exclusive to Nintendo
Switch
2. I'm standing over
here. Okay, everyone, join me inside the
game.
There are a lot of question mark icons
here. Let's examine
them. This sign reads, "Where are the
magnets?" The Joycon 2 controllers
attach to the system with magnets. And
those magnets are inside the
system. The SL and SR buttons on the
Joycon 2 are made of
metal. So that's how they attach to the
system.
A magnetic circuit is formed between
them so they won't easily
[Music]
detach. Through examining signs like
these, you can discover all sorts of
secrets about Nintendo Switch 2. Another
example, the Joycon 2 controllers have
mouse controls. And when combined with
the gyroscopes, you can even do
something like
this. You can adjust the position of the
golf club and aim for the cup by
rotating the Joy-Con, too.
By combining the mouse controls and
gyroscopes, things like this are
possible. There are secrets to discover
even as you're playing mini games and
tech
demos. Some of the secrets range from
the unique features of the system to
tiny details you might not notice until
they're pointed out. There are plenty.
There are plenty.
Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour will
launch as a paid digital game on the
same day as Nintendo Switch 2. So,
please check it out if you're
interested. Now, I'd like to share some
more information regarding Nintendo
Switch
2. This is the game card for Nintendo
Switch 2
titles. It's the same shape as Nintendo
Switch game cards, but it's now red and
it has much faster data reading speeds.
Next up is additional
storage. Switch 2 will only work with
micro SD Express
cards. They're a different type of SD
card and will make high-speed data
transfers
possible. Please note that regular micro
SD cards used for Nintendo Switch will
not be compatible.
[Music]
Additionally, to transfer data from
Switch to Switch 2, you can log into
your Nintendo account to use the system
transfer feature. With this feature, you
can transfer save data, digital games,
and
more. We're also releasing a new Pro
Controller. It has a C button, which
launches game chat. And on the back,
there are new GL and GR buttons, which
you can use to assign existing button
controls.
In addition, an audio jack has been
added. We've introduced a few new
features, and after today's
presentation, the official Nintendo
Switch 2 website will go live. There
will also be an Ask the Developer
article on the website where the three
of us will talk about the development of
Nintendo Switch 2. We hope you'll check
that out as
well. And now, the Nintendo Switch 2
launch
day. Nintendo Switch. Nintendo Switch 2
launches on June
5th. We're very much looking forward to
the day when you all get to experience
it. So, please wait just a bit
longer. Now,
broadly
speaking, on Nintendo Switch 2, you can
play three types of
games. The first type is Nintendo Switch
2 games.
These games take advantage of the
performance and features of Switch
2. The second type is compatible games
that were released on Nintendo
Switch. Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games
are the third
type. Some games that were released on
Switch will receive upgraded versions
that offer things like improved visuals,
unique ways to play on Switch 2, and
more.
Now, I'd like to show you the Nintendo
Switch 2 edition of Super Mario Party
Jamberee.
Please take a
look. Super Mario Party Jamberee is
getting an upgrade on Nintendo Switch 2.
The upgrade expands on the base game and
adds new features, including mouse
[Music]
controls, go, audio
recognition, more expressive
rumble, and gameplay that uses a camera
accessory. All of which can be accessed
on Switch
2. Let's check out three new and updated
modes.
First up is Mario Party mode. With a
single camera, up to four players can
join the festivities. You'll be able to
see each other's faces as you play, so
you can experience all their reactions
and emotions in real time. Or four
friends can take the party online.
Up next, it's Bowser Live, a mode where
the livelier team wins. Bowser will
bring you on stage two. Hit blocks to
collect the most
coins. Guide an RC car with your voice.
Go and compete in other mini games using
full body movement and sound. Finally,
take a ride on the mouse controlled
carnival coaster. With the safety bar
lowered and secured,
you're off.
Go. Use mouse controls to shoot down
enemies while you feel the bumps and
rumbles of the
coaster. When you enter a pipe, a
miniame will begin. There's a bouldering
game where two players each control an
arm and one where you shake a can of
spray paint and quickly tag
objects. Enjoy the thrill of these
intuitive mini games. How quickly can
you reach the station? From mini games
that use a camera, the built-in
microphone, mouse controls, and rumble,
the biggest party yet is getting even
bigger. Super Mario Party Jamberee
Nintendo Switch 2 Edition plus Jamberee
TV launches on Nintendo Switch 2 July
24th.
Nintendo Switch 2 players who already
own Super Mario Party Jamberee can
upgrade to Nintendo Switch 2 Edition
Plus Jamberee TV by purchasing an
upgrade
pack. Please look forward to a new Mario
Party experience where you can see each
other's reactions while
playing. Let's continue presenting some
more Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games.
[Music]
Nintendo Switch 2 editions of The Legend
of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The
Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
feature enhanced resolution and frame
rates and also support HDR, which makes
the image more vibrant, so you can play
with smoother, higher definition
graphics.
[Music]
Plus, you can get even more out of your
adventures in Hyrule using Zelda
Notes. This new feature can be accessed
via the Nintendo Switch app on smart
devices. It's a game-pecific service
that's exclusive to the Switch 2
editions of these
titles. For example, it can help guide
you to various locations like shrines
and Cororox you haven't found yet.

Or you can share your creations using QR
codes and send them to another player to

your adventures even more enjoyable.

In Kirby and the Forgotten Land, you'll
be able to enjoy an additional story
exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2
Edition along with improved graphics and
frame
[Music]
rates. This story takes place in the
Forgotten Land after being struck by a
powerful meteor that's causing some
mysterious changes.
We hope you're looking forward to
Kirby's new
adventure. Metroid Prime 4 Beyond will
have both a Nintendo Switch and a
Nintendo Switch 2
[Music]
edition. In addition to standard
controls, you can use mouse controls for
intuitive gameplay on Switch 2.
Plus, you can explore the immersive
world in 4K at 60 frames pers, or enjoy
smoother action in full HD at 120 frames
pers. Choose from these two modes, both
of which support HDR, based on your
preference and play style.
Plus, Pokemon Legends ZA, which is
scheduled to launch later this year,
will not only receive a Nintendo Switch
version, but a Nintendo Switch 2 edition
as
well. By taking advantage of the power
of Switch 2, you can enjoy your
adventure in Lumio City with enhanced
resolution and frame rates.

just saw will be available as both
