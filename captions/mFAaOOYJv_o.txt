Hey Switch fans, welcome back to Switch
Top. Today we're looking at the top 25
JRPGs you need to play on your Nintendo
Switch in 2025. JRPGs are games where
you follow a story, level up characters,
and fight in turn-based or action
combat. Let's dive into these amazing
adventures without any big spoilers.
Lunar Remastered Collection brings two
classic games from the 1990s back to
life on Switch. The story follows Luna
heroes Alex and Hero, who dream of
adventure and becoming like their idol,
the legendary Dragon Master Dy. What
makes these games special is how the
characters actually talk and have
personalities, which was rare when they
first came out. The combat is turnbased,
where you select attacks, magic, and
items from menus, but with an
interesting twist. Position matters.
Where your characters stand on the
battlefield affects their attacks and
defense. The remaster adds new voice
acting, improved graphics, and quality
of life features like save anywhere and
fast forward. If you love charming
stories about friendship and growing up
with a mix of humor and serious moments,
these classic JRPGs are perfect to
experience for the first time or revisit
on Switch.

Monster Hunter Rise isn't a traditional
JRPG, but mixes action combat with RPG
elements in an awesome way. The story is
simple. You're a hunter in Kamura
Village that must protect it from the
rampage, a horde of outofc control
monsters. The gameplay loop is what
makes this special. Hunt monsters,
collect materials from them, craft
better weapons and armor, then hunt
bigger monsters. What sets Rise apart is
the new Wirebug system that lets you zip
around like Spider-Man and perform
special switch skills that change how
your weapons work. There are 14
different weapon types from giant swords
to musical hunting horns, each with
totally different play styles. The game
shines in multiplayer where you can team
up with friends to take down massive
creatures together. With no levels to
grind and progress tied to your gear and
skill, Monster Hunter Rise delivers a
satisfying action JRPG experience where
you actually feel yourself getting
better both as a player and as a
character.
Pokémon Legends. Arus completely changes
the traditional Pokémon formula by
taking you back in time to when people
were afraid of Pokémon. You play as one
of the first Pokémon researchers,
building the region's very first
Pokedex. Unlike other Pokemon games,
this one features open areas where wild
Pokemon roam freely, and you can catch
them by actually aiming and throwing
Pokeballs in real time without always
battling first. If you do enter battle,
the combat is still turnbased, but with
a new twist. Faster Pokémon and moves
can act multiple times before slower
ones get a turn. The game focuses on
completing research tasks for each
Pokemon, like seeing them use certain
moves or catching multiple of them
rather than just battling gym leaders.
There's a crafting system where you
gather materials to make items like
potions and Poke Balls. While the
graphics aren't amazing, the fresh
gameplay makes this feel like the
Pokémon adventure many fans have always
wanted. One where the world feels wild
and you're truly exploring and
discovering Pokémon in their natural
habitats.

Final Fantasy 12. The Zodiac Age brings
one of the most unique Final Fantasy
games to Switch with major improvements.
The story follows Vaughn, a street kid
who gets caught up in a war between
empires and a resistance movement
fighting for freedom. What makes this
game special is its combat system called
the Gambit System. Instead of selecting
every action manually, you program your
characters with if then commands like if
ally HP 50% then cast cure or if enemy
is weak to fire then cast fire. It's
like being the coach of your team
instead of the player. The Zodiac job
system lets each character specialize in
specific roles like knight, black mage,
or archer with a license board where you
unlock new abilities and equipment
permissions. The game features a huge
open world that you can explore without
loading screens with tons of hunts,
special monster quests, and secrets to
find. With speed up options, a
remastered soundtrack, and improved
visuals, this version fixes the
original's slow pacing issues and makes
a complex but rewarding JRPG much more
accessible.

Suicaden 1 and 2 HD remaster brings two
beloved PlayStation classics to the
Switch with beautiful updated graphics
while keeping the original gameplay
intact. These games tell epic stories
about politics, war, and friendship
where you build and lead an army against
corrupt empires. What makes Suicaden
special is the 108 stars of Destiny
system. In each game, you can recruit
108 unique characters to join your
cause. Some fight alongside you. Others
help your headquarters by opening shops,
mini games, or upgrading your equipment.
Combat uses a simple turn-based system
with six party members, more than most
JRPGs, plus exciting one-on-one duels
and large scale army battles that play
like rock paper scissors with strategy
elements. The remaster adds quality of
life features like auto battle,
fastforward, and an improved inventory
system. While the games are separate
stories, playing them in order lets you
see how your choices in the first game
affect the world in the second.
[Music]
Fire Emblem Engage combines tactical
grid-based combat with relationship
building and a story about a dragon hero
awakening after 1,000 years to fight
returning evil. What sets this game
apart is the engage system where your
characters can summon heroes from past
Fire Emblem games like Marth, Ike, and
Bith to temporarily fuse with them,
gaining powerful weapons and abilities.
The core gameplay happens on a grid
battlefield where you move units like
chest pieces with each character having
different movement ranges and attack
styles. Position matters a lot.
Attacking from the side or behind does
more damage and keeping similar units
close provides support bonuses. Between
battles, you explore your home base
called the Somniel where you can cook
meals for stat boosts. Work out to
improve stats. Care for animals and
build relationships with your army
through conversations. The perade death
option where characters who fall in
battle are gone forever can be turned
off for a more relaxed experience.

Trials of Mana is a full 3D remake of a
classic Super Nintendo RPG that never
officially came to the west until now.
The story follows your chosen main
character and two companions on a quest
to restore the mana tree and stop evil
forces from unleashing destruction. What
makes this game special is its
incredible replay value. At the start,
you choose three out of six possible
heroes, and your choices completely
change parts of the story you'll see and
the team dynamics. Combat happens in
real time where you control one
character, switching between your party
members whenever you want and use light
attacks, heavy attacks, and special
abilities with cooldowns. Each character
can upgrade into different classes at
specific levels, dramatically changing
their abilities and appearance. For
example, the girl Angela can become an
explosive grand diver or a support
focused rune seer. The class system
creates tons of party combinations to
try in different playthroughs.
Shin Magami Tensei 5: Vengeance is the
expanded version of a dark
post-apocalyptic JRPG where modern-day
Tokyo has been destroyed and transformed
into a demoninfested wasteland called
Daot. You play as a high school student
who fuses with a mysterious being to
become the Nahobino, a powerful halfh
human halfdemon entity. The core
gameplay revolves around negotiating
with, recruiting, and fusing demons to
build your team. Instead of leveling up
fixed party members, you're constantly
creating stronger demons by combining
ones you've collected like Pokémon, but
with mythological creatures from world
religions and folklore. Combat uses the
press turn system where hitting enemy
weaknesses grants extra actions, but
missing or hitting resistances cost you
turns, making battles feel like
highstakes puzzles. Vengeance adds a
completely new alternate story route,
new areas to explore, and quality of
life improvements to the original game.

Unicorn Overlord mixes tactical RPG
battles with grand strategy elements as
you lead a liberation army to reclaim
your kingdom. You play as Alan, the
rightful heir whose throne was stolen,
building a revolutionary force by
traveling across five nations and
recruiting over 60 unique characters.
The battle system is what makes this
game special. Instead of controlling
every unit directly, you organize your
army into smaller teams that move and
fight automatically based on their
formation and the tactics you set.
During combat, you can trigger special
abilities, use items, or adjust
positions. But much of your success
comes from smart team building before
battle. Outside of combat, you
strengthen your army by liberating
towns, completing quests, managing
resources, and building relationships
between characters through events and
conversations. Compatible characters who
fight together can develop bonds that
unlock powerful combo attacks.
Does this shoot you? Witness the Royal
Blade.
I am your shield.
The Legend of Heroes trails from zero
with its incredible world building and
character development. Set in Crossbell,
a small city state caught between two
powerful nations, you play as Lloyd
Bannings, a new detective in the special
support section, a police division
created to help citizens with various
problems. While the story starts small
with your team of four handling minor
cases, it gradually builds into an epic
tale of corruption, politics, and
conspiracy. The turn-based combat
happens on grid battlefields where
positioning matters as abilities affect
different areas and moving around costs
action points. What makes this game
special is how alive Crossbow feels.
NPCs have their own stories that develop
after each story event, and talking to
everyone regularly reveals an incredibly
detailed world. The Orbment system lets
you customize characters by slotting
elemental quartz into their devices,
unlocking new spells and stat boosts in
countless combinations.

Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is a
remaster of the Gamecube classic that
brings Mario's paper thin adventure to
Switch with updated graphics. The story
follows Mario as he helps Princess Peach
investigate a mysterious treasure behind
a magical door in Rogueport. What makes
this game special is its unique battle
system. It's turn-based like most JRPGs,
but with time button presses that let
you do extra damage or block attacks.
The battles take place on a theater
stage with an audience that reacts to
your moves. If you perform well, the
crowd cheers and gives you power boosts.
As you explore, you'll use special paper
abilities like turning sideways to slip
through cracks or rolling up into a tube
to cross gaps. You'll meet tons of
quirky characters across unique worlds
like a fighting tournament, a spooky
ghost town, and a luxury train.
[Music]
Tactics Ogre Reborn brings one of the
most respected tactical RPGs ever made
to modern systems with major
improvements. The story is set in a war
torn land called Valyria, where you play
as Daam, whose choices during the
complex politically driven story will
determine which of the multiple endings
you'll see. The gameplay happens on
grid-based battlefields where you move
units and select actions from menus with
height advantages, backstabs, and
elemental strengths, all playing
important roles. What makes this game
special is the incredible depth of its
class system. You'll recruit and train
an army of different character types,
from knights and wizards to beast tamers
and special unique characters. The
reborn version adds voice acting,
completely rebalanced gameplay, and
quality of life features like the world
tarot system that lets you rewind
battles to try different strategies. The
Chariot Tarot lets you fast forward
through enemy turns, solving the slow
pace issues of the original.
[Music]
Nouni 2: Revenant Kingdom brings Studio
Gibli's magical art style to life in an
action JRPG that feels like playing
through an animated movie. The story
follows Evan, a young king who loses his
throne and sets out to build a new
kingdom where everyone can live happily
ever after. Unlike most JRPGs, the
combat happens in real time where you
control one character while AI controls
the others. You attack with light and
heavy attacks, dodge roll away from
danger, and use powerful special
abilities. The unique Higgled system
gives you little elemental spirits that
assist in battle with healing attacks
and buffs. What makes this game special
is its kingdom building feature. You'll
build and upgrade facilities, assign
citizens to different jobs, research new
technologies, and manage resources.
There's also a skirmish mode where you
command troops in little real-time
strategy battles.
[Music]
Live Alive is a remake of a 1994 Super
Nintendo RPG that never came to the west
until now. Bringing its innovative
multi-era storytelling to a new
audience. Instead of the one big story,
the game features seven separate
scenarios set in different time periods.
Prehistoric times, Imperial China, the
Wild West, feudal Japan, the present
day, the near future, and the far
future. Each chapter has its own main
character, unique gameplay mechanics,
and distinct visual style within the HD
2D graphics engine, beautiful 3D
environments with 2D pixel sprites. For
example, the ninja chapter lets you
choose stealth or combat approaches,
while the prehistoric chapter has no
dialogue and communicates through
pictures. The battle system is turnbased
on a grid where positioning matters.
Some moves hit in straight lines, others
in areas, and you can see enemies next
moves and range on a timeline.

Final Fantasy 1 to6 pixel remaster
collection brings the first six games in
the legendary series to Switch with
beautiful updated sprites, remastered
music, and quality of life improvements.
Each game tells a standalone story. From
the Warriors of Light restoring crystals
in Final Fantasy 1 to the steampunk
rebellion against an evil empire in
Final Fantasy 6, the battle systems
evolve across the games, starting with
basic turn-based combat in Final Fantasy
1 through 3, introducing the active time
battle system in Final Fantasy 4, where
character turns happen in real time and
culminating with Final Fantasy 6's more
complex character specific abilities.
What makes this collection special is
seeing how the series evolved. From job
systems that let you change character
classes to the esper system that lets
any character learn magic to iconic
summons like Ifrit and Shiva. The
remasters add auto battle, fastforward,
and adjustable encounter rates that make
the older games much more accessible.

Triangle Strategy delivers a mature
political story in a tactical RPG where
your choices truly matter. Set in the
continent of Norelia, you play as
Saranoa Wolfford, heir to a noble house
caught in the conflict between three
nations fighting over limited resources.
What makes this game special is its
conviction system. Throughout the story,
you'll make major decisions that are
voted on by your party members. You can
try to persuade them to your viewpoint,
but ultimately their convictions,
utility, liberty, and morality determine
their votes. These choices dramatically
change the story with multiple branches
and endings. Battles take place on
isometric grid-based maps where
positioning is crucial, attacking from
higher ground or behind enemies gives
advantages, while elemental attacks can
interact with the environment, like
electrifying water to damage enemies
standing in it. Between battles, you'll
explore locations, gather information,
and talk to characters to learn
different perspectives on the
[Music]
conflict. Mere Automata brings one of
gaming's most mind-bending stories to
Switch in a port that runs surprisingly
well. Set thousands of years in the
future, you play as combat androids 2B
and 9S who fight machine life forms on
behalf of humans who have fled to the
moon. What makes this game special is
how it blends different gameplay styles.
It's primarily a fast-paced action RPG
with light and heavy attacks, dodging,
and special abilities, but it regularly
switches to 2D platforming, bullet hell
shooting, and text adventure segments.
The plug-in chip system lets you
customize your character by installing
chips for different effects like health
regeneration or attack boosts, but with
limited space forcing tough choices. You
can even remove your operating system
chip if you want, though this has
consequences. The combat feels amazing
with fluid movements, air combos, and
switching between weapons mid attack.
Fire Emblem: Three Houses brilliantly
combines tactical battles with social
sim elements as you play a professor at
an officer's academy. At the start, you
choose one of three houses to teach. The
noble blue lions, the commoner friendly
golden deer, or the mysterious black
eagles. and your choice completely
changes the story you'll experience. The
game is split between two phases. During
weekdays, you teach students, improve
their skills, and build relationships
through activities like sharing meals,
choir practice, and tea parties. On
weekends, you can explore the monastery,
take on missions, or hold seminars.
Then, battles happen on grid-based maps
where perade is optional, but add stakes
to your decisions. What makes this game
special is how your teaching affects
battles. You decide how each student
develops by setting their weekly
lessons, potentially creating anything
from heavily armored mages to bow
wielding Pegasus knights. After a time
skip halfway through, the game
dramatically shifts as former friends
become enemies in a continentwide war.
You never had a chance.
I can.
Super Mario RPG is a complete remake of
the 1996 SNES Classic that brings the
original Mario role- playinging game to
Switch with beautiful 3D graphics. The
story follows Mario as he teams up with
Bowser, Princess Peach, and new
characters Malow and Gino to repair the
Star Road and defeat the weapon obsessed
villain Smithy. What makes this game
special is its innovative timed hit
battle system. It's turnbased, but

platforming challenges, and quirky mini
games like mine cart rides and barrel
throwing. The remake preserves the
original's charm and humor while adding
quality of life features like save
points before boss battles and visual
indicators for timed hits.

The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through
Daybreak, also known as Trails into
Revery, is the epic conclusion to
multiple story arcs in the beloved
Trails series. The game features three
separate protagonists with their own
parties and storylines. Rian Schwarzer
from Cold Steel, Lloyd Bannings from the
Crossbell Games, and a mysterious masked
figure called C with his own agenda.

crossroads system that lets you freely
switch between these three stories at
any time, seeing the same events from
different perspectives. The turn-based
combat builds on previous games with the
addition of the United Front system,
where characters can team up for
powerful combination attacks based on
their relationships. The True Rey
Corridor Dungeon lets you create dream
teams of characters from across
different arcs who never met in the main
story. While newcomers can still enjoy
the gameplay, this title works best for
those who've played previous Trails
games as it connects storylines from
multiple series while setting up future
adventures. show you a little beginning.

Octopath Traveler 2 improves on
everything that made the first game
special with its beautiful HD 2D art
style that mixes pixel characters with
stunning 3D environments. The game
follows eight different characters, each
with their own complete story. From a
warrior seeking revenge to a scholar
studying ancient ruins, you can start
with any character and recruit the
others in any order you want. What makes
this game special is the path action
system. Each character has unique
abilities they can use in towns, like
the thief stealing items, the merchant
buying rare gear, or the dancer charming
NPCs for information. The turn-based
combat revolves around discovering enemy
weaknesses and using boost points that
build up each turn to power up attacks.
The sequel adds a dayight cycle where
characters have different path actions
depending on the time and a new latent
power system that gives each character a
special ability when their gauge fills.
Here I
come. Allow me.
What's our plan of attack?
Persona 5 Royal brings one of the most
stylish JRPGs ever made to Switch with
all DLC included. You play as a high
school student who discovers the ability
to enter the metaverse. A world created
by people's distorted desires. By day,
you live a normal student life, going to
class, working part-time jobs, hanging
out with friends, and studying for
exams. By night, you and your friends
become the phantom thieves, entering
palaces, dungeons based on someone's
twisted desires to steal their heart and
make them confess their crimes. What
makes this game special is the social
link system. Building relationships with
friends and allies not only reveals
their personal stories, but also gives
you gameplay advantages like new
abilities and stronger personas,
creatures you summon in battle. The
turnbased combat focuses on hitting
enemy weaknesses to get extra turns and
performing devastating allout attacks.

memories. You join Blade, an

comfort food to perfection with its
polished traditional gameplay and
charming story. You play as the
luminary, a chosen hero marked by a
mysterious symbol who must gather allies
and save the world from a rising evil.
What makes this game special is how it
takes familiar JRPG elements, turn-based
battles, equipment upgrades, skill
trees, and executes them flawlessly with
modern quality of life features. The
combat system is simple to learn, but
has depth through the PEP system where
characters enter powered up states
during battle, enabling special combo

it. Xenolade Chronicles 3 takes our top
spot by masterfully combining the best
elements of previous games with a more
emotionally mature story. Set in the
world of Ionios, you follow Noah and
Mio, soldiers from opposite sides of an
eternal war where people live only 10
years, fighting constantly to fill their
life clocks by defeating enemies. When
six soldiers from opposing nations
encounter a mysterious figure, they join
forces and discover shocking truths
about their world. What makes this game
special is its battle system. It's real
time with auto attacks, but you position
characters and activate art special
moves when they charge. The class system
lets any character learn any role.
Attacker, defender, healer. Borrowing
skills from heroes you meet. The Orura

a powerful Mecca form with its own
abilities. The massive open world is

discover without the overwhelming
collectibles of previous games.
