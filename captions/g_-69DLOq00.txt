It's a huge week of new indie games once
again with a number of grim dark titles,
demos to try, thirdp person and 2D
action adventure titles, and a lot more.
So, let's begin with Drop Duchy, a
puzzle strategy rogue light where you
have to build and defend a kingdom using
falling blocks instead of clearing
lines. Each block you place becomes part
of your realm, influencing resource
production and military strength, mixing
city building management with almost RTS
style combat with the core Tetrislike
action remaining intact. There is a deck
building element with over 110 unique
cards, three factions to play as which
are completely unique and has rogike
procedural generation for replayability
and looks cleverly made. Trench Tales is
an intense third-person shooter which
blends horror and action in a setting
somewhere between World War I and two.
You are on a secret mission and have to
uncover the truth as to why you were
summoned to this desolate realm, hinting
that you might be a traveler from out of
time rather than a soldier in the war.
You will get access to an array of
period appropriate weaponry like old
school rifles, submachine guns, and
grenades with firearms being
customizable to suit your play style.
Speaking of which, you will also get
access to special powers such as slowing
down time, rapid healing, seeing through
walls, and unleashing burst energy. So,
somewhat of a supernatural element as
well with a fantastically crafted grim
environment. This video is brought to
you by Nightmare Busters Rebirth, a
reimagined 2D runand gun action game
originally conceived for the Super
Nintendo in 1994, later released in
2013, and is back with a new version,
having been meticulously overhauled and
blends classic arcade gameplay with
modern enhancements. You play as Flynn
or Floyd, twin leprechaun brothers and
season nightmare hunters as they embark
on a perilous journey to stop the
diabolical tyrants plan to corrupt
children's dreams, having fun-l
lookinging action with local co-op
support for two players as well. Battle
through six diverse and vividly animated
environments, each teaming with
relentless waves of enemies and
formidable bosses that test your
reflexes and strategy. You will get
access to a variety of magical attacks
and weapon upgrades during up the game
play with gorgeous traditional handdrawn
arts and animations. And we'll also be
making physical cartridges for the SNES
as well. If interested, their
Kickstarter will launch soon, so follow
the campaign via the link in the
description below. A stunning openw
world 3D platformer adventure game is
Spirit of the North 2 in which you play
as a lone fox accompanied by a wise
raven on a quest to restore the lost
guardians, cleanse the land from
corruption, and to return home. You make
your way through different biomes from
dense woodlands, snowy peaks, and
ancient crypts, each presenting unique
challenges and secrets to uncover. Our
dynamic duo will have a number of
traversal abilities like a dash or a
glide which you can use to explore mixed
in with puzzlebased encounters as you
take on these powerful corrupted
guardians but does not include
traditional combat per se. Find runes to
enhance your skills and gain new
abilities with cosmetic customization
options for the fox and raven as well.
This is the follow-up to the original
Spirits of the North from 2020, which
has over
4,300 Steam reviews and is good. So, I'm
excited for this. But do note that no
prior knowledge is required to enjoy the
sequel. Hordes of Hunger is a dark
fantasy thirdp person action rog light
inspired by vampire survivors in which
you face off against endless waves of
grotesque enemies. Each run offers a
chance to craft unique builds from
diverse weapons and abilities used in
intense combat with the different types
of enemies such as boots or howlers
requiring different strategies. The 3D
environment means that tactics like
utilizing choke points and high ground
will be crucial for survival. And as you
progress, you rescue survivors and NPCs,
uncovering fragments of the haunting
narrative mixed in with intense
postponing action, and you have a high
potential title. Love indie games? Sign

of what's hot along with some news and
of course weekly game giveaways. So if
interested, link is in the description
below. In the quiet ruins of a forgotten
world, Dlock Town invites you to rebuild
life from the ground up. This
sidescrolling farming adventure blends
cozy routines with unexpected
challenges. You start with simple
planting pots, nurturing crops amid
unpredictable weather like acid rain and
heat waves. As your skills grow, so does
your farm, expanding into automated
systems, and crafting tools to thrive in
this harsh environment. Exploration
leads you through treacherous wetlands
and abandoned ruins where secrets and
resources await. Along with farming, you
engage in platforming and combat using
drones to fight off mysterious creatures
with there also being a town with quirky
residents each with their own stories
who also offer quests and companionship
enriching your journey combining
elements of RPG simulation and adventure
and looks pretty cute.
Other games begins with Among Us 3D. On
paper, one of the more popular games of
the week since it taps on the Among Us
theme, the social deduction title that
has become one of the most successful
indie games of all time. This transforms
the familiar gameplay into a firstperson
experience where the core remains the
same where crew mates have to navigate
the corridors and complete tasks while
the imposters have to play along and
find the right time to strike. with the
same emergency meeting system being in
place as well. This is also a
remade/fused version of Among Us VR with
this game having VR support but can also
be played on a regular monitor
supporting four to 10 players crossplay
with features like proximity voice chat.
New objectives, including a whack-a-ole
style miniame, have been added along
with the introduction of star dust, an
in-game currency used for cosmetic
customization, as well as a new tag
mode, which introduces the infected
role, adding more variety. But I have a
feeling that this will not be as popular
as the original threequarters view
version. But it is still great that
there is this option. Chinese developers
tend to use the Chinese cultivation
theme, a mishmash of Chinese mythology,
folklore, and ancient Chinese history
with Ascension being the next game to do
so. But unlike other Chinese titles like
Blackmith Wukong or Amazing Cultivation
Simulator, this is a 4X strategy title
instead, which is extra interesting. You
play as a young disciple, the last hope
of a fallen sect, having to rebuild your
organization, explore uncharted lands,
establish a new home, manage resources,
expand your influence, and battle
formidable creatures and rival clans.
Diplomacy and warfare will be critical,
but it's very interesting that we have a
Chinese title in the 4X genre. In the
smoky heart of Pukui, a city teetering
on the edge of unrest, the last speak
easy stands defiant. Behind its bar, you
mix more than drinks. You stir secrets
in best served cold. This is a visual
novel adventure game where you step into
the shoes of a bartender detective. Each
cocktail you craft isn't just a drink.
It's the key to unlocking hidden truths.
As jazz melodies play, patrons from all
walks of life confide in you, revealing
tales that intertwine with a series of
chilling murders. Your choices matter.
Charm, intimidate, or deceive, to
extract information, where every
interaction could be a crew or a trap.
The game challenges you to solve five
intricate cases, each more complex than
the last. All set against the backdrop
of labor strikes and looming war, which
results in a tense atmosphere. Taking
the Valhalla or coffee talk formula and
putting their own spin on things.
There's something about massive trains
as a setting which is very interesting.
From snowpiercer to carbonary of the
iron fortress with another such title of
interest being break siege which puts
you in command of such a locomotive
having to power it up and get strong
enough to break through Imperial forces.
Most interestingly, while it is a
rook-like deck builder, combat is in
real time, so you have to think on your
feet, whose most direct comparison would
be run go, but with a different theme.
So, if you love trains or just curious
about realtime card combat, do check
this out. A very ambitious looking 3D
action adventure RPG is bygone Dreams.
Set within a surreal dream world where
you play as Wah, a spiritual entity on a
quest to save the dream realm of Loom
and its matron deity from a devouring
nightmare, releasing the prophecy free
prologue demo this week. This draws upon
Slavic mythology and medieval Bosnian
folklore with a ton of work going into
the game, including an orchestral
soundtrack with over 50 unique tracks as
well as 2 hours of fully voiced
cutscenes. Combat is fast-paced and
intense, mixing melee, ranged, and
elemental magic to overcome enemies and
powerful boss encounters. Further
customization exists in the form of the
abilities you select and multiple
difficulty settings as well as optional
challenges like time trials and no
damage boss challenges with exploration
and puzzle solving as well. The prophecy
version comprises of the first two
levels with two to three hours of
gameplay. to try this out to get a feel
for the game. Even more so than other
indie games, we are taking a step back
in time with Captain Blood this week. A
title that was in development for 10
years and then got abandoned, but from
the ashes rises this pirate themed
action adventure game in the 17th
century Caribbean. Live a pirates's life
filled with peril and plunder as you
participate in intense sword fights,
explosive ship battles, and go on a
quest for treasure. This has all your
expected pirate weapons from cutlesses,
pistols, and musketss to be used in
fleshy combos and finishes on land and
on ships. As you defeat foes, you earn
points to unlock new fighting techniques
and acquire gold for weapon upgrades.
According to Wikipedia, this title was
announced in 2003 and it shows in terms
of graphics and gameplay even in 2025
with this having more than a passing
resemblance to Prince of Persia:
Descends of Time, at least in terms of
art style. So, what is old is new again
and does look pretty nostalgic. In Deck
of Haunts, you embody a vengeful mansion
abandoned in the 1920s, now alive with
malice. By day, design your lair with
traps and eerie rooms with the main goal
being to protect your hut room, which is
the source of your power. Nightfall
brings intruders from regular humans to
drain to more concerning visitors like
law enforcement, priests, or even the
stonemasons. Use a deck of 35 types of
cards to summon phantoms, shift
hallways, and unleash terrors where bone
chilling screams to creaking floors
intensifies fears, pushing your visitors
towards madness. Once their sanity
breaks, extract their essence to expand
your mansion, unlocking new rooms and
powers. And while it's not October,
looks to be an excellent spooky title
worth picking up and perhaps revisiting
when the time is right. Speaking of
horror titles, one about the very real
threats of war is Deck Line, which
places you in a dire situation. Out of
ammunition, surrounded and abandoned by
command. In this bleak setting, you and
your squad engage in one final game of
Durac, a traditional Russian card game
to distract from the inevitable. The
game captures the raw essence of modern
combat reflecting the gritty atmosphere
of 1990s Eastern Europe. Its dynamic
randomized gameplay mechanics ensure
unlimited replay-ability forcing you to
constantly reshape your play style. With
a story mode featuring multiple endings
and an infinite competitive mode with
global leaderboards, this looks to be
quite the intriguing entry. In the
shadowy realm of the afterlife, Dice
with Death invites you to a high stakes
game where your fate hinges on the role
of the dice. This rog light deck builder
has you collecting unique dice and
relics, creating combos to deal damage
as you attempt to cheat death. There is
a push your luck element as you decide
on when to bank your points or to roll
again, having ropike randomization in
the dice and relics that you get, but
also has multiple character classes to
play as with some good pixel art as
well. Set in the rugged wild west where
dinosaurs never went extinct, Dino Path
Trail challenges you to survive in this
world which requires sharp instincts and
swift actions. Interestingly, this is a
survival rogike title instead of action
rog light where you do need to be
concerned with hunger, thirst, and
temperature on top of your health. Each
biome, be it scorching deserts, eerie
swamps, or icy peaks, presents unique
threats and hidden opportunities as you
gather resources, but fight when
necessary. Crafting becomes essential as
you scavenge for resources to build and
upgrade your mobile base camp with
intense twin stick shooter action rog
light style combat making you use
firearms and throwables to fend off
predators and outlaws. As your notoriety
grows, so does the challenge with
enemies becoming more relentless. But if
you do fall, death isn't the end. Each
demise unlocks new crafting recipes,
encouraging you to adapt and strategize
for future runs. So if you love dinosaur
games like me, this should be worth a
look. If you want to unleash your inner
rainboat within the convenience of
Steam, then Jew guessesser Steam Edition
will be the title to pick up where this
trivia/detective title drops you into a
random part of the world and you need to
guess where you are. Carefully study
signs, landscapes, buildings, car
license plates, and more to guess your
exact spot on Earth having a competitive
aspect as you are pitted against another
player. Or why not play this in team
duels as well? Each match challenges you
differently, pushing you from the
beginner ranks towards the excitement of
championship level games with every
guest suspense builds. So, will your
careful observation reward you or will a
tiny detail lead you astray? Geography
has never been this fun. Another demo to
try is Grandvier Zero Front, a thirdp
person Mac action rog light that places
you in the cockpit of a customizable
mech fighting against the invading
Millennium Company. Scavenge the
battlefield for parts to upgrade your
grand arms, legs, and weapons, tailoring
your machine to suit your combat style.
Between missions, manage resources
carefully, from taking loans to buy
ammunition or assisting the locals for
support as you plan your route to
extraction. This free release is a
standalone title, which is the prelude
to the Millennium Horizon campaign
planned for the main game where I love
my Max as well, so of course this is of
note. Gun Switch is a top-own arena
shooter where swarms of demonic aliens
surround you on all sides and you have
to fire your way out of this mess. Set
within the depths of a space prison
named Cberus. You command a squad of
androids named pawns as they work
together synergistically to defeat the
swamps of enemies. Utilize an arsenal of
upgradeable weapons capable of
unleashing thousands of bullets in mere
seconds with a realtime weapon
modification system which allows you to
adapt swiftly, switching loadouts to
counter evolving enemy tactics. Each
member of your Android squad serves as
an extra life, enabling seamless
character transitions, also having
shared or split screen co-op, so you can
play with friends. Of course, this looks
very vampire survivors inspired, but
nowhere on the Steam page do I see any
mention of Rook Light, so perhaps this
is a straight arena shooter more along
the lines of Crimson Men. Hands down,
Magic Studies is the prettiest title of
the week, where you step into a tranquil
realm where productivity meets
enchantment. This unique blend of cozy
background application and productivity
tool allows you to personalize your
study space as you sit like the
character in handdrawn environments
ranging from a serene forest to mystical
ancient cities. Adjust the ambiance to
match your mood, day, night, or rainy
settings while enjoying ambient sounds
and created lowfi or fantasy music.
Enhance your focus with built-in tools
like a to-do list and a pomodoro timer,
collecting elementals along the way as
well, and looks perfect for study
sessions, creative writing, or planning
adventures. Developer Rey World Studios
have been making a very specific type of
strategy game all these years. Do check
out their back catalog to get an idea of
what I mean. with Knights of the
Crusades being their latest entry. Sets
of course during the first crusade where
you command a fledgling holy order
shaping its destiny across Europe. This
real-time strategy game blends city
building and sandbox elements allowing
you to construct settlements, manage
resources, and engage in epic battles on
land and sea with massive armies. Choose
to align with the Templars or forge your
own path, expanding your influence
through diplomacy or conquest. As you
progress, you'll encounter dynamic
events from naval seizures to faction
wars with each decision influencing the
course of history. In the eerie halls of
Boyd Manor, you play as a babysitter in
Midnight Special, navigating a night
twisted by unseen forces. Interestingly,
this is a pointand-click survival horror
game drawing inspiration from '90s
classics and looks like a traditional
Scum Engine title. However, reality
bends at the shadows whisper. So, as you
explore the manners corridors, each
creaking floorboard and flickering light
deepens the sense of dread. puzzles
emerge not just as obstacles but as keys
to understanding the dark secrets of the
house with some horrifically macab pixel
arts as well which is just so
effectively done and is the hidden gem
of the week. We have had a number of
farming sims in a row starting from last
week. The latest of which is Pixel
Shire, a game which has been in
development for a little while and looks
to be a fairly by the numbers one of
these, but with an exploration element.
You begin with nothing but a humble
patch of land, yet soon find yourself
building an entire community from the
ground up. As you plant crops and raise
animals, the land transforms under your
careful guidance. But farming isn't your
only talent. You can also explore
procedurally generated dungeons and
lands, each filled with surprises and
hazards. Unique villages can settle in
your town, each offering their own
talents, friendships, and even secrets
that might unlock new adventures. You
decide where to place every home, road,
or river, making your village truly
yours, and participate in activities
like fishing, mining, and brewing with
each skill, unlocking another piece of
the world's puzzle, and looks similar to
Little Wood in the town building aspect,
and should be neat. No, this is not a
new Pizza Tower or DLC, but rather Rift
of the Necrodancer will be releasing
four new DLC tracks featuring music from
the indie platformer hit from 2023,
where each track offers a unique
challenge with varying difficulties and
a remix mode that shuffles the beat map
for a fresh experience every
playthrough. These will include a fully
animated papino spaghetti and a
background visualizer adorned with pizza
toppings adding a cheesy charm to your
rhythmic battles. So grab a slice of the
fun where it's interesting to see the
strategy around this game looking like a
guitar herolike model but for indie
games. We also have the release of Rift
Rift. Say that fast five times. A
charming tower defense title that has
demoed well. Step into a vibrant world
where strategy and adaptability are key
to defending your base against
relentless waves of monsters. There are
preset spots on the map to place your
towers, choosing from 14 unique tower
types, each with six powerful upgrades
to counter 25 distinct monsters across
15 diverse worlds. Enemies have
different behavior as well, targeting
your extractor or attacking every tower
in sight. So, you need to anticipate and
strategize around this. As you progress,
you unlock companions who assist in
battle, adding more variety to your
strategy. But as a whole, it is
relatively forgiving, allowing you to
schedule builds, refund misplaced
towers, and retry failed waves without
penalty, encouraging experimentation and
learning, and will be for fans of the
genre. Now, hear me out on this one
since Savara looks like a generic action
rog light, yes, but it has a stamina
system. So, a roglike soulslike, but
also an almost monster hunterlike
element where you gather resources from
defeated enemies and use it to craft new
equipment. Also having a boons system
that looks suspiciously close to Hades.
So, it's mixing and mashing ideas and
could be cool. Our protagonist is taking
part in the grand festivities honoring a
warrior god in the form of trials
designed to challenge the bravest
fighters across dimensions. As you
engage in combat, each weapon you wield,
be it thrusting, slashing, one-handed or
two-handed, offers unique advantages and
disadvantages, allowing for hundreds of
possible combinations to suit your play
style. Defeating formidable monsters
grants resources to enhance your arsenal
at the blacksmith and to make offerings
to divine statues, unlocking over 90
blessings that alter your abilities and
looks kind of fun. I love the art style
of spreadsheet, a puzzle game centered
around spreadsheets, which doesn't sound
like fun, but it's so weird and unique.
Set in a 1990s inspired office, your
knack for spreadsheets will become your
ticket to corporate ascension. As the
new office prodigy, you're tasked with
solving absurd challenges. From
balancing dubious budgets to covering
your boss's antics using formulas and
manipulating cells to achieve this, it's
a nostalgic nod to Windows 311, complete
with MIDI music and a clippy like
assistant named Copy, adding a layer of
charm to the game. Beyond spreadsheets,
you engage in quirky office mini games
like cleaning up after wild parties or
fixing malfunctioning printers, all
while navigating the satirical corporate
culture of the '90s on the journey to
become the ultimate bro. I'm always a
bit skeptical when it comes to publisher
playway and the myriad of titles that
they publish, most of which appear to be
firsterson simulator titles copypasted
with a different theme. But survival
machine is something different and does
have hype. This is a thirdp person
action crafting survival title where you
awaken aboard a colossal moving
fortress, your only refuge in a world
overrun by the undead. Build and expand
your mobile base while navigating
through everchanging biomes teaming with
resources and dangers. By day, you
scavenge for materials, craft tools, and
fortify your machine. And by night, you
brace for relentless zombie assaults
that tests your defenses and strategy
being funnily enough Fortnite Save the
World, but with a mobile base, where
co-op with friends looks like the ideal
way to play this and could be huge.
Here's another entry in the Toho project
named Toho Spell Carnival, where instead
of bullet hell shoots him up, this is a
bullet hell strategy RPG instead, which
definitely has me curious. Taking place
on grid-based battlefields, you recruit
and place a diverse cast of characters,
each bringing unique abilities and spell
cards to your team as their placement
counters the intricate projectile
patterns of your enemies. Between
battles, a shrine serves as your hub for
character interactions, side events, and
mission planning, looking like something
different in this space. I love my tower
defense games, so it's a good week for
me. With another title that I have my
eye on being Tower Dominion, a rog light
title with what appears to be quite the
amount of replayability. You are in
command of the last bastion of humanity
against a relentless alien invasion,
having to not only place towers, but
also sculpt the battlefield itself,
creating choke points and strategic
elevations to outmaneuver your foes.
Each tower and building is a scarce
resource, requiring careful selection
and placement to maximize their unique
strengths and upgrades. With 30 distinct
heroes across various factions, each
bringing unique abilities and
strategies, your approach to defense
evolves with every playthrough. After
each wave, you must adapt by choosing
from a set of upgrades and rewards,
reinforcing your strategy against the
everchanging enemy tactics with a
fantastic art style as well. This one's
for indie game developers. The free
indie game marketing resources are
ready, so sign up via the link in the
description below to get it in your
mailbox. Here's a very interesting
hybrid RTS citybuer named Darfall where
you play as a hero tasked with
safeguarding your settlement in the dark
fantasy realm of Agon. It uniquely
blends realtime strategy RPG and
survival elements where like a couple of
other games mentioned in this video by
day you focus on gathering resources,
constructing defenses and enhancing your
hero's ability. And as night falls,
waves of the undead and other malevolent
forces assault your city, so you need to
defend. It has a diverse roster of
heroes, each with distinct abilities and
play styles with story campaign, a
survival mode, and even a scenario
editor for creating custom maps and
missions, which provides extensive
replayability where if you played a
bunch of Warcraft 3 like me, I'm sure
this will be of interest. In Yes Your
Grace 2: Snowfall, you return to the
troubled kingdom of Devon, where each
decision you make as monarch carries
weighty consequences. This cinematic
kingdom management RPG has you balancing
limited resources, addressing the needs
of petitioners and navigating the
complexities of ruling a realm on the
brink. New features includes the ability
to pass laws, manage a marketplace, and
hire agents with unique skills and
personalities. The game also emphasizes
family dynamics as caring for your loved
ones becomes crucial amidst political
turmoil. Set against a backdrop inspired
by Slavic folklore, this introduces over
200 new quest objectives, enhanced
visuals, and deeper strategic elements,
ensuring that every choice shapes the
narrative and the kingdom's future. From
the people that worked on Lost in Random
comes The Midnight Block, a firstp
person horror adventure game with an
excellent claimation art style. You play
as the burnt one, a fragile figure in a
world where light is both your guide and
your only defense. You come across pot
boy, a lanternheaded creature who
becomes your companion, providing a
flame that illuminates your path and
distracts the grotesque monsters lurking
in the shadows that just want to
extinguish that very light. You are
making your way through the twisted
trail known as the Midnight Walk,
solving puzzles, outsmarting monsters,
and perhaps engaging in a little bit of
stealth with a narrative unfolding
across five interwoven tales, each set
in haunting loc. The monster designs are
pretty freaky and well done and hunted
by the claimation and will be of
interest to horror game fans. Real Gods
of Hystera is a survival crafting action
adventure RPG in which you awaken as a
dreamer, a character which is bound to a
monstrous sentient train known as a real
god, which is your only sanctuary in a
world twisted by the great old ones.
Your real god isn't just transportation.
It's a living fortress that hungers for
flesh, demanding sacrifices to fuel its
journey. As you traverse procedurally
generated hellscapes, you gather
resources, craft weapons, and build
custom carriages to expand your mobile
base. Combat is visceral, blending
melee, firearms, and dark magic,
allowing you to capture or destroy the
Eldrich horrors and cultists that stand
in your way. Between battles, you return
to your real god to purge madness.
unlock godke keeper abilities and
prepare for the next onslaught having
co-op support for up to five players and
looks high potential one of my most
anticipated games makes it to launch so
I'm more than happy to share the news
since you can go back in time to find me
talking about this game but it was then
still known as project elicis and after
further development a Kickstarter
signing with a publisher and a couple of
delays creature keeper will finally be
playable
an action adventure monster tamer with
real-time combat checking all of the
boxes that I look for in games. So
fingers crossed this will be excellent.
Watch this video for more action
adventure games.
