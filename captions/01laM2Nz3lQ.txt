Octopath aesthetic. It's so pretty.

Sorry. Oh, no hope. Oh my god. Just take
all that hope away from me right now.
No rescue. Oh, great. That sounds so
lovely.
Help. No one's going to hear you,
sweetie. I'm so sorry to break it to
you. Help me, Dante. It's not looking
good. You are Koname Dante, a special
agent with a
sophisticated called IBA embedded in his
left eye. Your mission that'd be very
distracting. Imagine having a person
only in your left eye. That sounds
mysterious escape and solve mindbending
puzzles in an explorable
environment. Everything you learn will
bring you one step closer to the truth.
July 25th. Okay. Consume darkness where
you're greeted by a yellow orb known as
Puck.
Um, Pac-Man spirit by examining your
surroundings. You can phase shift and
combine with Puck to explore areas you
couldn't reach before. Bro, just call
him Pac-Man. What are we doing with the
nickname? Lightly the creatures
inhabiting this world.
Who are we kidding? Facing there's like
this show.
Okay, Pac-Man. Didn't know you could do
that.
Maybe it's Pac-Man's cousin or
something.
Oh, demon Pac-Man. Experience a dark
twist on the iconic Pac-Man when Shadow
Labyrinth launches on Nintendo Switch
July 18th. Yeah. So, like, wasn't there
a show that like had Pac-Man in it? And
it kind of looked more like that than
actual Pac-Man, if anything.
Oh, what is this?
remasters of the Patapon team are
drumming onto Nintendo Switch as one
bundle
the Patapons and give different commands
to the Patapon army. Okay, that's kind
of
crazy advances them a PSP or VA game. I
feel like these were like exclusives.
Patapon has them.
Wow. Wow. Okay.
Even the audio of it, like it just
sounds nostalgic. July 11th. Okay,
that's cute. I appreciate that.
Oh. Oh, we're getting serious. Welcome
to Zepper Town. Okay. No, we're not. A
cozy place nestled in a windswept
valley. What is this? Where am I? This
is where your new life begins. Oh, okay.
Wow, that's very forward. Oh, Story of
Seasons. Grand Bazaar. This is like the
original Harvest Moon. Please take a
look at this.
Okay. Let's go.
Let's
go. Kirby.
No. It's like really like Twilight
Princess Kirby. Oh. Oh, what am I doing?
Making jokes. Oh my
god, guys. It's happening. This is not a
drill. Our queen is
here. The suit looks
good. The purple highlights are sick.
The unknown planet Vos.
Here, Samus finds a verted jungle with a
colossal tree at its center.
Okay. Avatar.
In order to survive and escape this
planet that she was unexpectedly
transported to, Samus must scan stone
figures and other relics to carve a path
[Music]
forward. She's not alone, though.
Abhorant alien creatures living in the
jungle are waiting to strike.
Let's
go. Oh my god.
Oh. Oh my god. Is this in the first
area? Take it
easy. Okay. Just got here, please.
Explores the planet. Samus is granted
mysterious and ancient powers. Let's go.
Psychic abilities.
Psychic. Oh, we're going to gaze into
the future. Allow Santa to operate
mechanisms and open doors.
Ooh. They also allow her to control the
trajectory of her beings with the power
of her
mind. Yo.
But why were these powers bestowed upon
Samus?
Yo, this is so cool. What that?
That's me. Yep, that's me.
[Music]
Thank you.
A
man, this is so cool. Will be her fate
after being summoned to Virros.
The threads intertwining beyond space
and time are beginning to weave, guys, a
new tale. It's going to be worth the
wait. This is so
exciting, guys. Just
I placed my faith in you, guys.
Yes.
[Music]
What's
that? This like another suit or Oh. Oh,
okay. New look. Okay. Who's this? Wow.
Okay, cool. Look, it's like a sports car
Varia suit. Like, let's go. Oh, it's
true. There was no release date still,
huh?
I have a feeling we'll get that in the
Nintendo Switch 2 Direct next week.
Wait, what is this? This looks like a
town in Pokémon. It's very much not
Pokémon. Oh my god. Imagine if like
Pokémon looked like this. Like imagine
that they like decide to get nostalgic
all of a sudden. There was like a Game
Boy Advance looking new Pokemon game,
bro.
Up and
learn to go from witch training. That's
okay. I'm excited for the new one.
What's it called again? The pizza, the
legend of the arcade games await. Okay,
I like that. Set off on a fantastical
mission in this handdrawn platforming
adventure. You'll explore an expansive
archipelago where nightmares and wonder
collide. The art style of this so
beautiful. It's like practically like a
Miyazaki, but it's a game. Rift of the
Necrodancer. Press the corresponding
buttons in each lane to fight monsters
in rhythm. Why is this name familiar?
It's going with epic boss fight. Was
this like a collaboration?
I feel like I've never seen like the
actual series though. This looks so
good. And be on the lookout for more
DLC.
Rift of the Necrodancer launches on
Nintendo Switch later today. Oh, today.
Okay, let's see what's in store.
Tamagotchi. I recognize those
silhouettes anywhere. Hey guys, welcome
to Tamagotchi Plaza, a brand new entry
in the Tamagotchi connection series. Is
that how you pronounce that? I thought
stores. My whole life I thought it was
Tamagotchi design glasses at the shop.
Gochi. Okay, it's the goat. That's okay.
I think the narrator is a big Tamagotchi
fan. He's like, "Yeah." So,
Tamagotchi business.
Yes. The Legends of the Z.
Dude, I'm ready. I'm so excited for this
game. Seriously, day one I will be here
playing Z to the A.
Welcome to Pokemon Legends ZA, a new
title in the Pokemon series.
You'll be
totarita though. Respect. Respect. The
setting is People hate on her way too
much. It doesn't make sense. Appeared in
Lumio City. Yes, we're back, baby. To
make it easier for people and Pokémon to
coexist, a company named Quaardico, Inc.
is carrying out an urban redevelopment
plan here. And hopefully isn't secretly
evil or something. And people of Lumio
City. You're like, that's the paw. It's
waiting to happen. Is it just me? I
don't know. Hopefully not. Hopefully
everything will be fine.
Scattered all over town are wild zones.
You can catch Pokemon here,
but they might be hostile. If you sense
trouble, get to safety.
Run away. Pokémon that live outside wild
zones, too. Oh, some of them can even be
found on rooftops. Oh, that'd be me. I'd
just be hanging out on the rooftop.
Pokemon live easygoing lives in Lumio
City. Nice. But this is the butt I was
waiting for.
The city's aura
transforms. Highly skilled trainers are
invited to participate in a
tournament. The ZA Royale. Okay.
Trainers await in battle zones.
Oh, watch out. Don't leave home when the
sun sets. I'll challenge you to battle.
Oh way. Okay, that's actually so cool.
So, it's like there's like a time of day
when you go roaming around and can fight
other trainers. Okay, I kind of really
like that idea. Move at the right moment
is key. So, you have the choice. It's
not like, you know, in a lot of the
games, like the older ones, like you
walk around and then like someone be
like, I see you. We need to fight now.
And you're like, oh no, I was just
trying to go over there. You know what I
mean? So, this is nice. You'll start at
rank Z and work your way up to rank A.
Oh, I see the Z to the
A. Bro, even the phones are fighting.
It's hard out here. Oh, and the night
time's going to look so good with the
glowing city.
Pokemon Legends. This is a good idea,
guys. Launches on Nintendo Switch later
this year. Can't
wait. Let's go.
Hello there.
Hi. The game you're about to
see doesn't have a big epic story,
but what it does have is lots of funny
little rhythm games.
Why is this Roblox? Like the ooh sound,
you know?
Just press the button to jump through
the ring. That's me. Okay, I kind of
love
it. I'm just a little guy.
Oh. Oh. Oh, sounds easy.
But the timing is super tricky. I mean,
yeah, it's a tricky angle, honestly.
Like, maybe you could try it in time to
a rhythm.
[Music]
Okay. What is
this?
[Music]
Oh, is this actually rhythm heaven?
Let's practice. You might even be able
to play this with your eyes closed.
What happened to the Ooh, we lost the
ooh sound effect. Oh,
[Music]
rhythm heaven groove.
I Is it am I ridiculous that any duck I
see reminds me of duck hunt? that we
have news about the use of digital games
on your system.
Please take a look. What do you mean?
Okay. Just some information. With game
cards, you can put a game featuring
Mario in this Nintendo Switch system.
Yes. And a Legend of Zelda game in this
one. I mean, inserting the games you
have on hand into any system you want.
Yes. Yes. But what if digital games
could be as flexible and convenient as
game cards? What? Well, here's what we
came up
with. Introducing the virtual game
card. In the future, virtual game cards
can be used for digital
games. When purchasing the digital
version of a game, it will be loaded
onto your system as a virtual game card,
allowing you to play that title. Your
digital games will be lined up as
virtual game cards on a dedicated
management screen. Here you can load and
eject your virtual game cards and manage
which games you can play on your system.
I don't I'm not really following to be
completely honest. You can eject a
virtual game card from one and load it
onto the second. With virtual game
cards, you can freely load and arrange
which games you play on up to two
systems. Okay. Two systems. Okay.
Interesting. Local communication with
your second system is required, but only
the first time.
Can you change the two consoles? You can
also link out virtual game cards to your
Nintendo account. Family group members.
Connect your family group member system
via local wireless when you want to lend
a game. Choose the title you're
lending and who you're lending it
[Music]
to, and you're done. You can only lend
one game at a time to a particular
person. Games can be lent out for two
weeks, after which they will
automatically return to you. Okay,
Blockbuster. We're bringing Blockbuster
back, guys. Digital games even easier to
use. Virtual game card.
Okay. I'm just curious if you're like
really locked on two consoles. You know
what I feature lets you swap games cuz
if you have three different like let's
say you have a light OLED and regular
Switch like could you transfer between
the three of them a system update in
late April because you you you it said
you can choose a second one but can you
switch the second one you know what I
mean you have to return your game within
two weeks or you're going to get charged
late fees watch out everybody's golf
series is driving on Nintendo Switch
Such like we nostalgic kind of music.
Just right and take your shot. Nice
shot.
Perform back. Oh spins. Imagine. Oh, I
wish I could do that in real life so
bad. Yo,
in the single player. How do I do it?
Teach me the way. This is so cute. It's
like so like nostalgic energy. Like like
there's something about the whole vibe
of it.
[Applause]
What is this? Oh, okay. Captain America.
Unite some of Marvel's greatest
superheroes in the fight against evil.
This art style is 15, including the
likes of the spectacular Spider-Man and
the ferocious Wolverine to take on the
challenge. From close quarters
combatants to aerial aces, you can mix
and match a variety of heroes for an
amazing array of
possibilities. and swap between your
team of two at any time. Take advantage
of your team strengths to overwhelm your
foes. Sorry. Up to four players can
assemble for local or online co-op play.
I I'm shocked to my core right now.
Excuse me. The fate of the Marvel
Universe begins when Marvel Cosmic
Invasion launches on the Nintendo Switch
system this holiday. So cool. What the
heck? It's giving like Shredders
revenge. Marvel, please take a look. And
it looked
beautiful. Let's keep it going more. Oh
my god.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Wait.
Wait. What? Bro, what is this? Is this
like a Tamadachi life? I swear. No way.
No way. No way. No way. No. I'm losing
my mind. Don't. Is this really
happening? Is this for real? Oh my god.
I have goosebumps. Why do I have
goosebumps in some life? No way. Is this
actually happening right
