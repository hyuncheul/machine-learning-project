The Nintendo Switch 2 is on the horizon,
and anticipation is skyhigh, not just
for the new games, but for what it means
to hackers and homebrew enthusiasts. The
original Switch became infamous in
hacking circles for how quickly it fell
to exploits, leading to a thriving
homebrew scene and rampant piracy early
in its life. Now, the big question is,
will history repeat with the Switch 2,
or will Nintendo lock this system down
tight? In this overview, we'll dive into
everything we know about the Switch 2's
hardware and OS. its expected security
features, the homebrew community's early
analysis, and how Nintendo might counter
the inevitable cat and mouse game of
exploits and piracy. Hey everyone, my
name is you and this is Better Gaming.
Locking it down, Switch 2 security
versus the original Nintendo learned
hard lessons from the original Switch
security failings. The 2017 Switch was
famously cracked wide open within its
first year on the market, thanks largely
to a flaw in the Nvidia's Tigra X1 chips
food ROM. This was the exploit code
named Fusy Jali. Essentially a hardware
bug that allowed hackers to run unsigned
code via USB recovery mode and it was
unpatchable via software. Only a new
hardware revision could fix it. For
context, that hack revealed in early
2018 gave permanent jailbreak ability to
millions of Switch units and kicked off
a homebrew gold rush. Nintendo scrambled
to release a revised Switch internally
called Marico in 2019 to finally close
the hole. So, with that history in mind,
expect the Switch 2 to be far more
secure from day one. Both Nintendo and
Nvidia surely focused on tightening
every obvious crack. Here are the key
security improvements and differences we
anticipate. No more easy boot ROM bucks.
It's virtually certain that the new
Nvidia sock in Switch 2 has an ironclad
boot process. Nintendo won't want a
repeat of Fus Jali. The Tigra X1's
bootloader mistake was a one ina million
oversight. Odds are Nvidia's newer chip,
possibly based on the orange family, has
undergone insane security review. In the
later Marico Switch units, for example,
the boot ROM was updated to glitch
attacks by initializing memory with an
infinite loop instruction, so any errand
jumps would just hang. A strategy that
Switch hackers says M praised as super
good. The switch to boot ROM will likely
include similar or even more advanced
protections to prevent glitching or
injection at startup. In short, no more
paperclip tricks to get into recovery,
even if you can enter a recovery mode.
It probably won't accept unsigned
payloads. Changes to RCM recovery access
on the original switch entering the
vulnerable RCM. The recovery mode was as
simple as shorting a pin on the Joy-Con
rail with a jig, hence the famous paper
clip hack. Put your micro SD into your
Switch. Take the right Joycon out and
slide the RCM jig inside. Hold the
volume up button and click once on power
on. Connect your Switch with your PC,
then click on inject with Tigra RCM.
Congrats, your Switch is jailbroken.
With the Switch 2 design showing
magnetic JoyCons, attachments, and
different connectors, that specific
hardware entry point may be gone
entirely. JoyCons now use a physical
plug or wireless connection that won't
expose the equivalent of that pin
typically used for RCM. The old short
pin 10 to ground method is likely
extinct on Switch 2. Even if a recovery
mode exists, it might require a
different button combo that isn't as
easily hijacked. And without a buck like
TGAS recovery might be locked on signed
code only stronger OS kernel and
firmware security. The Switch operating
system horizon was actually quite
secure. Most of the major exploits early
on were in the bootloadader or Nvidia's
libraries not the Nintendo OS itself.
Hacker Sers AM who helped create the
atmosphere custom firmware even stated
he believes the Switch secure monitor
micro kernel had zero security bugs.
That's a testament to Nintendo software
security prowess. For Switch 2, we
expect Nintendo to double down, likely
using an updated OS with modern
mitigations like hypervisor or
virtualization to isolate processes.
Rumors of Horizon OS 2.0 suggest a
design where even if a game or old
Switch title running in backwards combat
mode is compromised, it can't easily
break out into the systems layer. The OS
will also enforce code signing and
integrity checks at every stage.
Basically, the firmware will be at least
as hardened as the later Switch
versions, which to this day have had no
publicly known software jailbreak
without a mode chip, encrypted and
authenticated everything. Expect all
content on the Switch 2, from the
firmware to game cartridges to save data
to be encrypted and tied to the
hardware. The original Switch already
did this in an extent. It uses encrypted
storage and per game encryption keys.
The Switch 2 will likely use an advanced
security co-processor. Nvidia's Tigra
line includes a security engine for
cryptographic operations. This means
things like the NAND internal storage
being encrypted so you can't just clone
a disc image to another switch and
bootloadader storage is verified by
digital signatures. The goal is to leave
no easy avenue for hackers, no loose
file systems to pro at, no debug
interfaces left open, and certainly no
forgotten beast mode debug keys looking
at you 3DS and Wii days. Hardware
exploits will be tough. The agreement in
the homebrew community is that if when
Switch 2 gets hacked, it won't be as
simple as a software exploit. Save money
is on a mode chip. That implies needing
a hardware attack like glitching the CPU
or messing with voltages timings to
bypass security, similar to how hackers
eventually hacked patched switch units
with MO chips that perform fault
injection. The Switch 2's design might
include counter measures against this.
For example, chips could be packed in
epoxy or have sensors to detect
tempering. Even if glitch hack is
possible, it requires significant skill
and hardware. Far from the days of
sliding a jig and running a program,
nothing is unhackable in theory. But
Nintendo will aim to make their barrier
to entry extremely high. The Switch 2 is
expected to launch more like the
PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles
with robust security that could take
hackers years to fully crack, if ever.
Nintendo and Nvidia have had nearly
eight years since designing Tigra X1 to
improve their approach. All known
vulnerabilities from the Switch era will
be patched or mitigated in the new
hardware. This doesn't mean the Switch 2
will be sealed forever. History shows
dedicated hackers will eventually find a
way, but day one exploits or freebies
like Fusy Jelly are highly unlikely. The
cat and mouse game will enter a new more
difficult phase for the modding
community, hacker and homebrew
community.
But despite the expected security
upgrades, the homebrew community is
already a buzz with speculations and
plans for the Switch 2. These are the
folks who live for their challenge of
cracking consoles, and the Switch 2 is
the shiny new target on the horizon.
Here's what prominent voices and
community members are saying. Nothing is
unhackable, much less unmodable. It
depends on the willpower of those who
are capable. This quote from a veteran
member on GBA sums up their sentiment.
Hackers are confidently that eventually
an exploit will be found for the Switch,
too. It's more a question of when and
how. There's an almost traditional
belief in the console hacking scene that
given enough time and talent, every
system fails. So, enthusiasm remaining
high even if patience will be needed.
Likely path: mode chips or
glitches. Many in the community predict
that hardware mode chip solution will be
the first viable route into the Switch
2, if not the only route, at least early
on. This mirrors what happened with the
later model switches, Marico and OLED
models where hacker couldn't soft them
easily and instead resorted to glitching
hardware mods like the half mode chip.
On forums, people are already discussing
possibly glitch attacks, vectors for
switch 2, for instance, exploiting the
faster NVME based SD card interface or
other subsystems. One speculative idea
is that if the Switch 2 supports micro
SD Express PCIe interface, maybe a
crafted device could manipulate that to
execute code. It's all theory crafting
at this stage, but it shows the
community is thinking hardware. In
general, the expectations is if you want
homerew on switch 2, you might
eventually be soldering a chip or using
some hardware hack, not just running an
app. Respected hackers views Cyrus M,
one of the lead developers of
atmosphere, custom firmware and a key
figure in switch hacking, has expressed
both admiration for Nintendo security
and doubt that easy flaws will exist in
the new hardware. As mentioned, he
believed the original Switch secure
monitor had no vulnerabilities to begin
with, and he didn't expect a software
exploit for the patched switches. It
will surprise me if we manage to hack
Mario, he once said, and rewitched the
switch hacking Discord community. There
has been chatter that Cyrus isn't
planning a day one pursuit of switch to
hacking. Partly because it might be
fruitless until a flaw is discovered and
also perhaps due to burnout from
carrying the Switch scene for years.
This means the baton might pass to a new
generation of hackers or groups when it
comes to Switch 2. Still, you can bet
Cyrus M and veteran hackers will be
analyzing the system under the hood,
poking at the OS, looking for any
mistakes Nintendo made this time, and
sharing insights, even if they hold back
any exploits until it's safe to release.
Community
coordination. Back in the Switch version
one days, multiple teams re-switched,
fail overflow, Team Executor, etc. were
all finding bugs and sometimes stepping
on each other toes. For Switch 2, the
landscapes is a bit different. Team
Executor, the more piracy focused Mochip
team, was dismantled by law
enforcements. More on that later, and
researched members are less formally
organized. Now, there are smaller groups
and lone wolves on forums already
starting ground work. Don't be surprised
if an underground private exploit is
found but kept secret for a long while.
With modern consoles, hackers sometimes
sit on vulnerabilities to avoid them
being patched too quickly, as happened
with the PlayStation 5, where hackers
quietly enjoyed kernel exploits for
years before disclosure. The Switch 2
might see a similar approach. If someone
finds a soft exploit, they might only
release it publicly once Nintendo has a
patch for a new hardware revision so
that early adopters can have a permanent
hack. Interest in emulation and
homebrew. The homebrew crowd is very
excited at the prospect of a more
powerful switch purely from a homebrew
software perspective. Imagine custom
emulators and media players on a Switch
to that's as strong as a PlayStation 4.
retro emulation, 4K video playbacks,
maybe even running PC indie games via
Linux. However, community members temper
that excitement with realism. Without a
hack, none of that is possible. There is
also the topic of Switch 2 emulation on
PC. Ironically, if the Switch 2 is
intact, people can't dump the system
files necessary for emulators to support
it. So, the PC emulation scene Yuzu Rio
Jinx is indirectly dependent on hackers
extracting keys, firmwares from a switch
to at some point. It's a weird dynamic
where both pirates and preservationists
are waiting for the first shoe to drop.
In other words, the first vulnerability
to really start tinkering with the
platform. In essence, the hacking
community's mindset is challenge
accepted, Nintendo. They know the Switch
2 will be harder to crack, but that only
makes it more intriguing. The tone is a
mix of respect for Nintendo's expected
security. They will probably do a good
job locking it down, and determination
will find a way in eventually, though.
As one GBA attemp user put it, much like
in 2017, I said it then and I will say
it now. Nothing is truly unhackable. It
just might not be publicly shared. The
cat and mouse continues quietly for now
until the console is in hand and tools
can be unleashed. The Switch One versus
Switch 2, a tale of two jailbreaks. It's
worth looking at how quickly the
original Switch was jailbroken and what
allowed it versus what's likely
different this time around. The Nintendo
Switch launched in March 2017.
Remarkably, by Mind 2018, hackers had
achieved full arbitrary code execution
on it. In fact, multiple groups found
exploits around the same time, and that
was just funny. The critical one was the
Tigra X1 boot bug fusali disclosed by
Kate Tenkin from re-switched and also
utilized by fail overflow. They called
it Schoff L2. This exploit was made
publicly in April 2018. because it was a
hardware flaw. Every Switch manufactured
up to that point was vulnerable forever.
Hackers didn't even need to find a
software hole in the Switch OS. The keys
to the kingdom were essentially handed
to them via Nvidia's mistake. This feels
almost unreal to compare. Previous
consoles like the PlayStation 3 took 3
to four years to fully crack and some
Xbox One never had a public full exploit
in their prime. The Switch was analy. As
a result, by summer 2018, the community
had custom firmware atmosphere in
development, homebrew launching, and
yes, piracy in the form of
NSP/XCI files. Nintendo was not ready
for that timeline. Nintendo's response
to Nintendo's credit, they acted as
swiftly as hardware company can. In June
2018, they quietly started shipping
updated Switch units with eye patch
fuses to block that specific USB RCM
vulnerability, the so-called Fusy Jelly
patch units. Though those were still
bypassable by other means for a while.
The big move was the Marico revision
2019 which used a new Tigra X1 Plus chip
with the boot bug fixed in Silicon.
Along with that, newer firmware titaned
OS security. From that point on, no soft
hacks existed for new switches. It then
took until 2020 to 2021 for hackers to
devolve glitching mode chips to crack
Marica units, meaning the window of
unpatchable hack was roughly mid 2018 to
mid 2020. After which anyone who wanted
to jailbreak a new bot switch had to
physically mod it. So Nintendo did close
the barn door eventually, but the horse
had long bolted. The Switch 2 will
launch in the position that the original
Switch only reached after 3 years and a
hardware update. that is, it will likely
have no known easy exploits and possibly
require hardware mods from the start.
So, we might see a reverse scenario.
Instead of a soft hack first, then hard
mods later, the Switch 2 could see hard
mods if someone decaps the chip or uses
advanced glitching before any software
exploits is ever found. It could be a
situation more akin to the Xbox 360 era
which requires mode chips or DVD drive
hacks early on or the PlayStation 5
which as of 2025 only has some limited
software exploits on old firmware and
nothing widespread. If the Switch 2
security is closer to modern Sony
Microsoft consoles, we might not see a
public jailbreak for years. And if one
does emerge, Nintendo can patch it via
firmware if it's softwarebased since
there's presumably no unpatchable boot
bug this time. It's always possible that
the Switch 2's fancy new features
introduces an unexpected vulnerability.
For example, some have speculated about
the new backwards compatibility layer.
If Switch 2 indeed runs older Switch
games in a sandbox, maybe an exploit in
an old game, something like an old
WebKit exploit or a game specific bug
could be used to break out the sandbox,
similar to how the Wii mode on Wii U was
exploited. Nintendo's likely aware of
this and will secure the sandbox, but we
won't know until people poke at it.
Also, new hardware interfaces, say the
dual USBC or the faster SD interface
could have exploitable firmware. Hackers
will surely inspect the Switch 2 system
for any overlooked debug modes or
manufacturer back doors. While the
expected scenario is a clean, secure
lounge, the hacking scene will probing
everything, hoping for a lucky break. If
by some chances the Switch 2 has a
vulnerability on the level of Yuzi Jali,
it would be Christmas come early for the
homebrew crowd and a nightmare repeat
for Nintendo. But betting on that would
be
unwise. I I can't stop laughing. Oh my
god. Timeline
expectations. With the original Switch
within weeks of release hacked found
entry points, there was a WebKit browser
exploit for 3.00 firmware by summer
2017, though it was userland only. Fall
2017, they had kernel exploits on all
the firmwares. By spring 2018, the
Budron Bach made all that irrelevant by
opening everything. or switch to a
realistic optimistic scenario for
hackers might be no substantial progress
publicly for at least several months.
Perhaps by 6 to 12 months in someone
might announce a basic userland exploit
or hint they got code running in some
capacity. A full jailbreak custom
firmware running could easily take 1 to
two years if not more. Again, assuming
no trivial bug, it's possibly the Switch
2 won't be truly cracked until mid to
late in its life cycle, which was
actually the norm for older consoles. In
other words, the PlayStation 2 took a
few years, 3DS took a couple of years
for a convenient software hack, etc. The
Switch One was an outlier in how fast
and wide open it was. To put it another
way, Switch One hacking was a sprint.
Switch to hacking will be a marathon.
For those eager to run emulators on the
Switch 2 or rip their games, you might
be waiting a while. And that's exactly
what Nintendo wants. Nintendo's
antipiriracy plans for Switch 2. It's no
secret that Nintendo has been one of the
most aggressive companies in the world
when it comes to fighting piracy with
the Switch to expect Nintendo to bring
an even bigger arsenal of both
technology and legal muscle to deter
hacking and illegal game sharing. Here's
how Nintendo is likely to combat piracy
on the Switch, too. Softwarebased
counter
measures. The Switch's online
infrastructure already has what Cyrus M
called extremely strong antipiriracy
measure. Notably, Nintendo can detect
pirated games when a console goes online
by checking for valid tickets, licenses,
and unique game card certificates.
Nintendo actually perfectly prevents
online piracy here. Cyrus M wrote
explaining that for digital games, the
console verifies that the game's ticket,
a sort of encrypted license, matches the
console's unique ID and the user's
account. If anything doesn't match, bam,
instab in the physical game case, each
cartridge has a unique certificate. And
if two consoles try to use the same
certificate online, Nintendo can detect
that and ban offenders, you can be sure
the Switch 2 will continue this
approach. Even legitimate game, digital
or physical, will be cryptographically
tied to your system or account. If you
try to play a pirated copy online,
Nintendo servers will know. This doesn't
stop offline piracy, but it's heavily
discourages it because going online is
basically suicide for a hacked console.
Many Switch hackers from the first
generation kept their modded units
completely offline to avoid Nintendo's
banhammer or just block the servers from
Nintendo. Nintendo has even gone a step
further by partnering with a third party
DRM solution. In 2022, it was announced
that Denu, a controversial anti-temper
DRM used on PC games, is now authorized
middleware on the Switch. Specifically,
a product called Nintendo Switch
emulator protection became available for
developers to use, aiming to prevent
Switch games from being easily emulated
on PC. This means some Switch and likely
Switch 2 games might come with extra DRM
that runs checks to ensure the game
isn't being run on unofficial hardware
or in modified state. If companies adopt
this, even if you dump a Switch to game,
it might refuse to run on an emulator or
hacked unit without significant reverse
engineering. It's unclear how many games
will actually use the Nuvo on Switch 2.
The Nuvo can impact performance, which
is critical on a console, but the very
fact Nintendo allowed it shows they're
exploring every angle to corp piracy and
even the emulation of their new system.
Robust firmware update and banning
policy. Like the Switch and 3DS before
it, the Switch 2 will likely require
regular firmware updates that not only
add features, but patch any security
holes. Nintendo will vigorously push
updates and may even require a system to
be on the latest firmware to access
online services as they do now. If an
exploit is found and made public,
Nintendo will aim to patch it ASAP and
might even use telemetry to see if
consoles are exploiting it. Expect
instant console bans for things like
connecting to Nintendo network with
unauthorized software or modified game
data. The original Switch saw waves of
bans for people with custom firmware who
dared to go online, especially if they
cheated in games or accessed things they
shouldn't. The Switch 2's ban policy
will be just as strict, if not stricter,
since Nintendo wants to nip piracy into
but secure hardware supply
chain. Nintendo has also taken steps to
secure the hardware itself from
tempering at the factory level. We saw
this with the Switch Light and OLED
models. they came with different chips
and even tiny changes like removing
debug pins, etc. For Switch 2, Nintendo
might include measures like silicon
unique IDs that ensure each conso's keys
can be used on another, making cloning
hard, or even onchip mechanisms that
detect glitch attempts. Some secure
processors can detect abnormal voltage
spikes or timings and lock up if an
attack is sensed. While details are
under wraps, the idea is Nintendo will
try to make sure that mass production
leaks or hardware troans are minimized.
They don't want to repeat of someone
leaking the boot code or keys like what
happened with the Nvidia leak that
reveals the NVN API of the new hardware.
So you can be sure every step from
manufacturing to retail will have
security in mind, legal enforcement and
deterrence. Beyond the tech, Nintendo's
legal team, sometimes dubbed the
Nintendo Ninjas, will continue to play
hard ball. We've seen them take down
drum sites, sue individual distributing
hacks, and even put hackers in jail. A
famous example is Gary Bozer, no
relation to Mario's Bozer, ironically,
of Team Executor, who was part of
selling Switch mode chips, he was
arrested, sentenced to 40 months in
prison and hit with an astonishing 14.5
million in fines. With Switch 2, if any
group tries to sell Mochips or piracy
enabling devices, Nintendo will come
after them aggressively. So, the era of
openly selling something like SX Pro for
Switch 2 is likely over. Any such
operations would be deeply underground.
Basically, piracy on Switch to will
carry serious risk, not just of bans,
but potentially legal consequences if
you're involved in distributing hacks or
illicit
copies. Online service integration.
There's speculation that Nintendo will
further integrate the Switch 2 with
online services in a way that encourage
legitimate use. For example, they might
expand Nintendo's works online to
include more cloud-based features that
are hard to replicate on a hacked
system. Perhaps cloud saves that verify
game legitimacy or a requirement to sign
in for certain big games. Though an
always online requirement for games
would be very un Nintendo, so that's
unlikely for single player content.
Still, the idea is to make being online
legend attractive and being offline and
pirating isolating. If Switch 2 launches
alongside a robust online account
system, which they already hinted, your
Nintendo account carries over to Switch
2, then your purchases, friends, and
cloud saves all tie into that. Losing
access due to a ban becomes a big
deterrent because you would lose all
your eShop purchases and multiplayer
access. Nintendo basically says, "Go
ahead, heck for homerew if you want, but
you will be playing alone with whatever
you can get working, and you will never
connect to our services again."
antipiriracy and cartridges. There could
also unseen improvements in the physical
media security. Switch cartridges game
cards had some built-in security unique
certificates as mentioned and encrypted
per title. It's possible the new game
cards for Switch 2 have improved
encryption or authentication that hasn't
been broken yet. Maybe they'll use a new
encryption algorithm or larger key sizes
now that the hardware is newer. This
would make dumping and decrypting games
harder until keys are found. If backward
compatibility is supported via one slot,
the new cards might physically look
similar but have different protocols.
Some rumors suggest higher transfer
speeds. If Nintendo uses something like
an updated key management, we know
Switch One keys were eventually
extracted. It might take a while for
hackers to dump the new keys needed to
decrypt Switch 2 game data. To wrap up,
Nintendo's approach with Switch 2 is
likely a multi-layered defense, secure
hardware design, strong software online
checks, and relentless legal pressure.
The goal is to delay the widespread
piracy that hurt the Switch software
sales. Nintendo hates that some people
just download hundreds of games on
modded Switches. If they can delay a
public hack for even two to three years,
that's a huge win in terms of preventing
piracy during the crucial early sales
period of the console. And if a hack
never fully materializes, like how the
Xbox Series consoles remain essentially
unhacked as of 2025, Nintendo would be
overjoyed, though the homebrew fans
would be disappointed. Nintendo hasn't
even toed to investors how they plan to
migrate users to the new system using
Nintendo accounts partly as an
antipiriracy user retention measure. The
Switch to present a tough choice. Enjoy
the new hardware and games with a
Nintendo's wallet garden or hold out
hope for a crack and risk it all to run
unsight code. Nintendo's clearly hoping
most people choose the former and
they're stacking the deck to make sure
piracy on the new console is as
inconvenient and unrewarding as
possible. It's entering a scene very
different from the wild west days of the
original Switch launch. Nintendo is
bringing it a game insecurity to protect
this new console from its fate of its
predecessor. On the other side, the
conso's hacking community is rallying
its best and brightest excited by the
challenge and the possibilities that a
more powerful Switch offers. It's the
classic cat and mouse scenario. As
Nintendo builds a higher wall, the
hackers sharpen their tools to climb it.
For at least the initial months or even
years of the Switch 2's life, expect a
relative quiet on the hacking front. I
got code running in standby mode, one
might say, to a flurry of speculation.
Meanwhile, Nintendo will be monitoring
every system update and server lock like
hawks for any suspicious activity. It's
a highstakes tech arms race. In the end,
who wins? If history is any guide,
homebrew will find a way. But Nintendo's
goal is to ensure that by the time hacks
emerge, the console will have already
sold tens of millions of units and a
huge library of games, minimizing the
impact of piracy on their bottom line.
For sure enthusiasts, it means we might
have to exercise something not often
associated with modern tech. Patience.
Enjoy the Switch 2 for what it offers
officially and keep an ear to the ground
for the breakthrough. The moment someone
yells, "Hack achieved," you can bet I
will send shock waves through the
community. Until then, it's kind of
exciting, isn't it? The mystery, the
suspense, the gradual unrevealing of a
new system secrets, it's likely a grand
puzzle for the brightness minds in this
scene. Whether you're a hardcore
homebrew coder or just an intrigued
observer, the Switch 2's launch and the
subsequent hacking attempts will be a
drama to follow, one thing for sure, the
Switch 2 will not make it easy. The days
of simple exploits are likely over, at
least for this generation. So, don't go
bending your paper clips just yet. You
might be in for a long wait, but as the
saying goes, console security is a
marathon, not a sprint. And the race is
about to begin. Grab some popcorn or a
screwdriver, depending on your
inclinations. And let's see how this
next chapter in this eternal Nintendo
versus Hacker Saga plays out. Don't you
ever forget to smile. I hope I'll see
you in the next video. My name is you.
Peace.
up. Up.
