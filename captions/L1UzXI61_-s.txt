With game cards, you can put a game

Nintendo Switch console and a Legend of
Zelda game in this one. Freely inserting

want. But what if digital games could be
as flexible and convenient as game
cards? Well, here's what we came up
with. Introducing the virtual game
card. In the future, virtual game cards
can be used for digital games.
[Music]

game, it will be loaded onto your
console as a virtual game card, allowing
you to play that
title. Your digital games will be lined
up as virtual game cards on a dedicated
management
screen. Here you can load and eject your
virtual game cards and manage which
games you can play on your
[Music]
console. If you have two Nintendo Switch
consoles, you can eject a virtual game
card from one and load it onto the
second.
Now you can play this game on the second
console wherever and whenever you want,
just as if you had inserted a physical
game
card. With virtual game cards, you can
freely load and arrange which games you
play on up to two
consoles. Local communication with your
second console is required, but only the
first time.
[Music]
You can also lend out virtual game cards
to your Nintendo account family group
members. Connect to your family group
members console via local wireless when
you want to lend a game. Choose the
title you're
lending and who you're lending it
to. And you're done. They can now play
on their own console.
You can only lend one game at a time to
a particular person. Games can be lent
out for 2 weeks after which they will
automatically return to
you, making digital games even easier to
use. Virtual game
