Hey Nintendo fans, welcome to my
channel. Today I'm counting down the top
25 best games you can play on Nintendo
Switch right now. I'll keep things
simple and explain what makes these
games special without spoiling the fun.
Let's jump right in. Aie and the Will of
the Wisps is a beautiful adventure game
where you play as Aie, a small glowing
spirit creature. After being separated
from your owl friend Coup during a
storm, you must explore a huge forest to
find her. The game lets you run, jump,
and climb through colorful environments
filled with both friendly creatures and
dangerous monsters. As you play, you get
new abilities like sticking to walls,
dashing through the air, and shooting
light arrows at enemies. The game has
lots of puzzles to solve and hidden
areas to find. What makes this game
special is how smooth it feels to move
around. Jumping between walls, swinging
on ropes, and gliding through the air
feels amazing. The music changes with
what's happening on screen, making
exciting moments even more exciting and
sad moments even more touching. While
the game can be challenging, it never
feels unfair. And the story about
friendship and helping others will stick
with you long after you finish playing.
Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a
relaxing game where you create your own
island paradise. You start with a tent
on an empty island and slowly build it
into a beautiful community filled with
animal neighbors. The game follows real
time. If it's morning in real life, it's
morning in the game, too. Each day
brings new things to do, like catching
bugs, fishing, digging up fossils, or
decorating your house. What makes this
game special is that there's no rush or
pressure. You play at your own pace and
decide what's important to you. Want to
focus on making the perfect home? Go for
it. Rather collect every bug and fish
for the museum? You can do that, too.
The game changes with the seasons,
bringing different events, creatures to
catch, and items to collect. You can
also visit your friends islands or
invite them to yours, sharing items and
ideas. Animal Crossing became super
popular during 2020 when people were
stuck at home, giving everyone a calm
place to hang out with friends virtually
and create something beautiful together.
Super Mario 3D World Plus Bowser's Fury
gives you two great Mario games in one
package. In 3D World, Mario and friends
must rescue fairylike creatures called
Sprixies from Bowser. You run and jump
through colorful 3D levels, collecting
power-ups like the cats suit that lets
you climb walls and scratch enemies.
What makes this game fun is that you can
play with up to three friends, helping
each other or competing to get the most
points. Bowser's Fury is completely
different. It's an openw world adventure
where Mario teams up with Bowser Jr. to
help stop a giant outofcrol Bowser. You
explore Lake Lapcat, a world filled with
cat- themed islands, collecting cat
shines to calm Bowser down. Every few
minutes, giant Bowser appears, making
the sky dark and shooting fire at you.
You'll need to either hide or find a
special power up to grow giant yourself
and fight back. Both games have that
perfect Mario feel where jumping and
running just feels right.

Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is a
remake of a beloved GameCube game where
Mario is flat like paper in a 3D world.
The story follows Mario searching for
Princess Peach in a mysterious town
called Rogueport, where an ancient door
is said to hide a great treasure. As you
play, you'll meet many funny characters,
solve puzzles, and fight in turn-based
battles that happen on a stage with an
audience watching. What makes this game
special is how it mixes adventure with
humor. The writing is really funny with
characters often making jokes about
being in a video game. During battles,
you can make the audience cheer for you
by performing well, giving you more
power. Mario can also use special
abilities by folding himself into
different shapes, like a paper airplane
or a boat, to reach new areas.
Throughout your journey, you'll team up
with unique partners who each have
special skills to help in battles and
puzzle
[Music]
solving. Pokemon Legends Arus takes the
Pokemon series in a new direction by
going back in time to when people were
still afraid of Pokémon. You play as a
trainer thrown back in time to the Hewi
region, which later becomes the Cinno
region from other games, where your job
is to create the world's first Pokedex
by catching and studying Pokémon. What
makes this game different from other
Pokémon games is how you catch Pokémon.
Instead of always battling first, you
can sneak around in open areas and throw
Pokeballs directly at wild Pokémon. You
can hide in tall grass, craft items like
smoke bombs to distract Pokémon, or use
berries to lure them closer. Battles are
faster and more action-packed with
Pokemon able to use moves in different
styles that might hit harder or move
quicker. The game has five large open
areas to explore, each with different
Pokémon and secrets to find. There are
also special alpha Pokémon that are
bigger and stronger than normal ones and
angry noble Pokémon you need to calm
down as part of the story.
[Music]
Super Mario Wonder brings new excitement
to 2D Mario games with the Wonderflower,
a special item that completely changes
how levels work. When someone touches a
Wonderflower, crazy things happen. Pipes
might grow legs and walk away. Mario
could turn into a spike ball or balloon,
or the entire level might flip upside
down. You never know what will happen
next, which makes every level feel
surprising and fun. The game takes place
in the Flower Kingdom, where Mario and
friends must stop Bowser after he merges
with a powerful Wonderflower. You can
play as 12 different characters,
including Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy,
Toad, and even Yoshi. Each character has
slightly different abilities. For
example, Yoshi can flutter jump to stay
in the air longer. The new elephant
powerup lets you smash blocks and spray
water with your trunk, while the drill
powerup lets you dig through the ground
and ceiling. The game also introduces
badges that give you special abilities
like wall jumping or starting levels
with
[Music]
powerups. Ha.
[Music]
Dragon Quest 11S is a huge adventure
game where you play as the luminary, a
hero chosen by Destiny to save the world
from a powerful dark lord. When your
hometown is destroyed, you set out to
gather allies and discover your true
purpose. What makes this game great is
how it takes classic role- playinging
game ideas and makes them feel fresh and
fun. Battles are turnbased, which means
you choose commands for your characters,
like attack, use magic, or heal from a
menu, then watch them play out. The game
lets you switch between modern 3D
graphics and a special 2D mode that
looks like older games, which is perfect
for fans who like the classic style. As
you travel across the colorful world,
you'll visit towns with unique problems
to solve. Fight monsters in fields and
dungeons, and collect materials to craft
better equipment. Each character in your
party has their own story and special
abilities in battle. The Switch version
includes extra story content, a fully
orchestrated soundtrack, and the ability
to speed up
[Music]
battles. Fight, fight, and fight some
more.
[Music]
Luigi's Mansion 3 puts Mario's scared
brother Luigi on a ghost hunting
adventure to save his friends. After
Luigi, Mario, Peach, and the Toads are
invited to a luxury hotel, they discover
it's actually a trap set by ghosts who
capture everyone except Luigi. Armed
with the Poltergus G00 vacuum cleaner,
Luigi must explore the hotel's themed
floors to rescue his friends. What makes
this game fun is how each floor of the
hotel feels completely different. One
floor might be a medieval castle,
another a natural history museum with
dinosaurs, and another a disco dance
floor. Luigi can flash ghosts with his
strobulb light to stun them, then vacuum
them up after a short tug-of-war battle.
The game introduces Gooey, a gooey clone
of Luigi, who can squeeze through bars
and pipes to reach new areas. You can
switch between Luigi and Guigi at any
time. And a second player can control
Guigi for co-op play. The Poltergust has
new moves like the slam attack to smash
ghosts against the floor and the suction
shot to pull objects with a plunger.
[Music]
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the
biggest fighting game crossover ever,
bringing together over 80 characters
from different video game worlds to
battle it out. The game features
everyone from Mario, Link, and Pikachu
to characters from other companies like
Sonic, Mega Man, and even Final
Fantasy's Cloud. What makes Smash
Brothers different from other fighting
games is how easy it is to pick up and
play. Instead of memorizing complicated
button combinations, you mostly use the
same buttons for different characters
with the moves changing based on which
direction you press. The goal isn't to
drain a health bar, but to knock
opponents off the stage. The more damage
a fighter takes, shown as a percentage,
the farther they fly when hit. The game
offers tons of ways to play. You can
battle on over 100 stages, each with
items and hazards that can be turned on
or off. You can play with up to eight
players locally, fight against the
computer, or go online against players
worldwide. Donkey Kong Country: Tropical
Freeze. Donkey Kong and his family must
take back their island home after it's
frozen over by the Snowad Vikings, a
group of Arctic animals. What makes this
game special is how good it feels to
control. Donkey Kong has weight to his
movements that makes jumping and rolling
feel powerful and satisfying. The levels
are beautifully designed with each world
having a different theme like a tropical
island, savannah, underwater caves, or
fruit factory. Every level introduces
new ideas that keep the game feeling
fresh from start to finish. You can play
as Donkey Kong alone or team up with a
partner character. Diddy Kong with his
jetpack, Dixie Kong with her helicopter
hair, or Cranky Kong with his pogo stick
cane. Each partner gives you different
abilities to help navigate the
challenging platforming sections. The
game features amazing boss fights
against the Viking leaders, secret
puzzle pieces, and Kong letters to find,
and bonus levels that test your skills
in new ways.
[Music]
Astral Chain puts you in the shoes of a
police officer in a futuristic city
where mysterious monsters called Chimeas
are attacking. What makes this game
super cool is that you control two
characters at once, yourself and a
captured monster called a legion that's
connected to you by a chain. You can
send your legion to attack enemies while
you fight from another side or stretch
the chain between you to trip enemies.
The game mixes fast action fighting with
detective work where you investigate
crime scenes, talk to witnesses, and
solve puzzles. There are five different
legions you can use, each with special
abilities like a sword legion for
cutting things or an arrow legion for
shooting distant objects. Between
missions, you can explore the neon lit
city, help citizens with problems, and
customize your character and legions.
The controls might take some getting
used to since you're controlling two
characters, but once you get the hang of
it, the combat feels amazing.
[Music]
Pikmin 4 is a strategy adventure game
where you play as a space rescuer who
crash lands on a strange planet. To
survive and complete your mission, you
need help from cute little plant
creatures called Pikmin. Each type of
Pikmin has different abilities. Red ones
are fireproof. Blue ones can swim.
Yellow ones can conduct electricity and
more. You point where you want your
Pikmin to go, and they'll carry out
tasks like fighting enemies, breaking
down walls, building bridges, or
carrying items back to your base. The
big new addition in this game is Ochi, a
doglike companion who can carry Pikmin
on his back, help fight enemies, and
swim across water. During the day, you
explore the planet, solve puzzles, and
gather resources, but you need to return
to your ship before nightfalls when
dangerous creatures come out. There's
also a new night expedition mode where
you can venture out after dark with a
smaller group of Pikmin for high risk,
high reward missions.
[Music]
Kirby and the Forgotten Land takes
Nintendo's pink puffball into a 3D world
for the first time in a main game. After
being sucked through a mysterious
portal, Kirby lands in a world with
abandoned shopping malls, amusement
parks, and cities that nature has
started to reclaim. As always, Kirby's
main power is copying abilities by
swallowing enemies, suck up a swordsman
to get a sword, a fire enemy to breathe
flames, or an ice creature to freeze
things. What's new is the mouthful mode
where Kirby stretches his body around
large objects like cars, vending
machines or light bulbs to use them in
creative ways. For example, car mouth
lets you zoom around and smash through
walls, while cone mouth lets you slam
into the ground to break cracked floors.
The game has two difficulty modes. Wild
mode for players wanting a challenge and
spring breeze mode that's easier for
younger players or those new to games.
Between levels, you'll build up Wadd D,
unlocking many games, shops, and powerup
upgrades as you rescue more Wadd D's
from each stage.

Suicaden 1 and 2 HD remaster brings two
beloved role- playinging games from the
PlayStation era to Switch with improved
graphics and quality of life updates.
These games tell epic stories about war,
friendship, and destiny. With the first
game following the son of a great
general who joins a rebellion against a
corrupt empire, while the second follows
a young man caught in a conflict between
two nations. What makes the Suicaden
series special is the 108 stars of
destiny system. In each game, you can
recruit up to 108 different characters
to join your cause. Some join through
the main story, but many require you to
complete side quests or meet special
conditions. Your headquarters grows
larger and more lively as you recruit
more people, with some characters
opening shops, mini games, or other
helpful services. The battle system is
turnbased, meaning you select commands
for your six-party members and then
watch them play out. There are also
exciting large-scale war battles where
you command units of soldiers and
one-on-one duels that play like rock
paper scissors with strategy
[Music]
elements. Metroid Prime Remastered
brings one of the greatest games ever
made to Switch with beautiful updated
graphics and modern controls. You play
as bounty hunter Samus Aaron, exploring
the mysterious planet Talon 4 after a
space pirate ship crashes there. Unlike
most Metroid games that are 2D
sidescrollers, Prime is played in firstp
person view. You see through Samus'
visor as you explore, solve puzzles, and
battle alien creatures. The game focuses
on exploration and discovery rather than
just shooting everything. You'll need to
scan objects and enemies to learn about
them and find clues to progress. As you
explore, you unlock new abilities for
Samus' power suit, like the morph ball
that lets you roll through small
tunnels, the grapple beam for swinging
across gaps, and various weapon upgrades
for defeating enemies and breaking
barriers. The world is divided into
different areas with unique
environments, lava filled caves, snowy
mountains, ancient ruins, and even a
crashed spaceship.
Xenolade Chronicles 3 is a massive role-
playinging game set in a world where two
nations, Kev and Agnes, are locked in
endless war. You control Noah and Mio,
soldiers from opposing sides who
discover the truth about their world and
join forces. What sets this game apart
is its unique battle system. Fights
happen in real time where your
characters automatically attack, but you
choose special moves called arts that
charge up over time. You can switch
between different classes like sword
fighter, healer, or defender to change
your role in battle. The game standout
feature is Ura Boros, where two
characters can fuse together into a
powerful form with devastating
abilities. Another cool system is Chain
Attacks, where you pause the action to
line up a series of powerful moves for
massive damage. The world is huge and
beautiful with giant open areas to
explore filled with monsters, side
quests, and hidden treasures. As you
journey, you'll build relationships
between your six main characters,
learning about their hopes and fears
through heart-to-heart conversations.

Monster Hunter Rise lets you become a
hunter in a world where people live
alongside dangerous monsters. When your
village faces the threat of a monster
rampage, you must hunt increasingly
powerful creatures to protect your home.
The game features 14 different weapon
types, each with completely different
play styles. The great sword is slow but
powerful. The dual blades are fast with
quick combos. The hunting horn lets you
buff teammates with music and many more.
Hunts follow a simple loop. Prepare by
crafting items and eating meals for
bonuses. Track down the monster. Fight
it until you can capture or defeat it.
Then use parts from the monster to craft
better weapons and armor to take on even
tougher beasts. What makes Rise special
compared to earlier Monster Hunter games
is the wire bug, a grappling hook-like
insect that lets you zip through the
air, run up walls, and perform powerful
special moves called Silk Bend attacks.
The game also introduces palamutes, dog
companions you can ride to move quickly
across the map or fight alongside you.
I'll let you down.
Good.
Here comes the
Hades is an action game where you play
as Zagreos, the son of Hades, trying to
escape from the underworld to reach
Mount Olympus. Each time you try to
escape, you'll fight through randomly
arranged rooms filled with different
enemies and challenges. When you die,
and you will die a lot, you return to
the House of Hades, where you can
upgrade abilities, talk to characters,
and learn more about the story before
trying again. And what makes Hades
special is how it turns dying into part
of the fun. Each time you return home,
the story progresses. Characters react
to how you died, and you grow stronger
for your next attempt. Combat is
fast-paced and fluid with your main
weapon, a special attack, and a dash
move that makes you briefly invincible.
During each escape attempt, the Greek
gods like Zeus, Athena, and Poseidon
offer you boons, powerful upgrades that
change how your attacks work, like
making your sword shoot lightning or
turning your dash into a damaging wave.
With six different weapons that each
play differently, and thousands of
possible boon combinations, no two runs
feel exactly the same.
A palm of
power. They must have lots of these upon
Olympus. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the
ultimate version of Nintendo's beloved
racing game. packed with more content
than any Mario Kart before it. You race
as characters from the Mario universe
and with DLC characters from other games
like Link from Zelda and Isabelle from
Animal Crossing on wild and colorful
tracks. The basic controls are simple.
Accelerate, break, drift around corners
to get speed boosts, and use items like
shells and banana peels to help yourself
or hinder opponents. What makes Mario
Kart 8 special is its anti-gravity
feature that lets tracks twist upside
down and along walls, completely
changing how courses are designed. The
game includes 48 tracks in the base
game, plus 48 more through the Booster
Course Pass DLC, bringing the total to a
massive 96 courses from throughout Mario
Kart history. There are also 42 playable
characters and tons of vehicle
customization options with different
carts, bikes, wheels, and gliders that
affect your speed, acceleration, and
[Music]
handling. Hollow Knight. You play as a
small bug knight exploring the ancient
ruined kingdom of Hallow Nest, a vast
underground world where a mysterious
infection has driven many of its bug
inhabitants mad. The game is a Metroid
vania, meaning you explore
interconnected areas, find new abilities
that let you reach previously
inaccessible places and become stronger
as you progress. Your main tools are
your nail, a sword-like weapon for
attacking enemies, and your spells that
use soul energy collected from hitting
enemies. The combat feels precise and
satisfying. You can slash, dash through
the air, and jump over enemies while
managing your limited health. As you
explore, you'll find charms that you can
equip to customize your abilities, like
making your nails stronger, healing
faster, or adding new effects to your
dash. The world of Hallow Nest is huge
with many distinct areas like the green
green path, the dark deepness, the rainy
city of tears, and many more, each with
unique enemies and challenges.

Fire Emblem: Three Houses is a strategy
game where you play as a teacher at a
military school with three different
houses of students. You'll choose one
house to lead and your choice changes
the whole story. The game has two main
parts. During the week, you teach your
students and build relationships by
having meals together, answering their
questions, and helping them with
problems. Then on mission days, you
fight in turn-based battles where you
move your characters on a grid like a
chess board. Each student can use
different weapons and magic, and they
can be trained to learn new skills or
change to different classes like archer,
knight, or mage. The story involves
political conflicts, mysterious enemies,
and secrets about the world's history.
What makes this game special is how you
grow attached to your students as they
develop from teenagers into skilled
warriors.

Xenolade Chronicles X Definitive Edition
lands on the Nintendo Switch with a
massive upgrade to its already ambitious
sci-fi world. Set on the sprawling alien
planet Meera, players join Blade, a task
force exploring this hostile new
frontier after Earth's destruction. You
take control of a fully customizable
protagonist as you traverse diverse
biomes, battle towering creatures, and
uncover secrets across a truly massive
open world. The Switch version adds
welcome quality of life features like
easier time control and streamlined
party management, while the new quick
cooldown mechanic spices up the game's
real-time combat system. Of course, the
highlight is still the skills,
transforming mechs that you can pilot,
fly, and fight in, making you feel like
a one-person army with online squad
tasks and global nemesis battles.
There's plenty of room for teamwork,
too. Whether you're terraforming,
exploring, or taking down alien beasts
the size of buildings, this is a
definitive Zeno experience through and
through.
Open fire. Follow me.
Target inside.
Shadows hammer. Nice. Move in and do
some damage. Flame grenade.
Octopath Traveler 1 and 2 are role-
playinging games that look like old
school games but with modern 3D effects.
The style is called HD 2D and mixes
pixel art with beautiful lighting. Each
game lets you choose from eight
different characters with their own
stories, like a merchant who can buy
items from people, a thief who can
steal, or a dancer who can charm others
to follow her. What makes these games
special is how each character has a
special ability they can use in towns.
You might use a hunter to challenge
someone to a duel, a cleric to guide
someone to safety, or a scholar to learn
secrets. Battles are turn-based with a
boost system where you save up points to
make stronger attacks. Finding enemy
weaknesses is key. Hit them with the
right weapon or spell type to break
their shield and stun them. Both games
let you combine character jobs to create
powerful ability combinations, and the
stories eventually connect in surprising
ways. With beautiful music, charming
towns to explore, and eight intertwining
adventures in each game, the Octopath
Traveler series offers classic RPG fun
with modern improvements. Out of my way.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

how people think about Zelda games. In
both games, you play as Link, who wakes

trouble. Breath of the Wild lets you
explore a huge version of Hyrule with
mountains, forests, deserts, and snowy
regions you can visit in any order.
Tears of the Kingdom add sky islands
above and a huge cave system below
ground. What makes these games special
is the freedom they give you. You can go

puzzles in different ways, and approach
situations however you want. Both games
have a physics system that creates fun
possibilities. In Breath of the Wild,
you can use fire to create wind that

scenery, these Zelda games create a
sense of adventure like no other.

other things. The game takes you to many

this game special is how it rewards
exploration. Each kingdom is filled with
power moons to collect over 800 total.
And they're hidden everywhere, from
obvious places to incredibly clever
hiding spots. Mario has never controlled
better with jumps, flips, dives, and
rolls that feel amazing to perform. The

players can challenge themselves with
truly difficult platforming sections.
With beautiful graphics, catchy music,
including the showstopping jump up
superstar and song, and the perfect mix
of new ideas and classic Mario feeling,

Nintendo Switch game.
