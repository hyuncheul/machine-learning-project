well here we are again today we want to
build a super special security tower
let's do it security tower sounds like a
lot of fun here's the plan mikey and i
will each make our own security tower
then we'll have our towers face off in a
strategy showdown wow awesome i'll go
build mine now
great just so you know mikey we're
building ours separately let's each make
our own security tower let's go i'll
build mine further away all right
somewhere around here okay let's build
mine's gonna rock there we have it let's
begin
good i wonder how it'll turn out
this looks like a perfect location for
me to build my tower i think i'll build
it with iron blocks i thought i saw
mikey building his with dirt my iron
blocks will be a lot better
i'll use a command oh i built my tower
so fast i can't even see the top
whoa mikey's really trying
now then let's see
hmm
i'll put the entrance somewhere over on
this side
there we go okay whoever gets to the top
of the security tower wins
this door is a good start but i want to
add even more security to the entrance
i'll make this a fake door it's a
classic dummy trap if you try to get in
through this door you immediately fall
into the lava
you might not be able to tell it's fake
at first if you're running in with some
momentum you'll definitely fall into the
lava pool
okay since i created a fake entrance i
should probably create a real entrance
too
for this next part i need four
ingredients sticky pistons redstone
torches redstone dust and redstone
repeaters now that i have all of those
i'll make a super easy secret entrance
i'll open it like this
now then
let's see
i'm gonna make something like this
oh yeah that's perfect
now we'll place some iron blocks around
here
terrific
don't forget to cover the top
here this looks like a good spot to put
redstone torches
nice
now i'll place the repeater here with a
two second delay
the last thing i need to do is connect
it all with some redstone dust and then
my secret entrance will be complete
wait a sec something's not right here
[Music]
okay it's done
now it's time to shift my focus to where
i set up the redstone torch this section
right over here
i'll install a button on this wall i
know i'll use a birch button so it's
harder for intruders to notice once
that's finished the only way to activate
the hidden door will be through this
button
all right the fake security entrance is
complete wow check out mikey's tower now
i'll explain how my entrance works first
when you open the fake door you fall
into lava as for the real door as soon
as you hit this hidden button the secret
entrance opens up and you can enter
through here
[Music]
i'll clean this area up a bit
there that's better
[Music]
i have to hide this circuit
and cover this up
okay all done yes
remember when you arrive at the top of
the other person's tower you win the
security tower competition i guess that
means the only way to make it fair is if
i install a ladder extending upwards in
my tower this will be the only way for
mikey to climb up
[Music]
i'll climb up the ladder while i build
it
[Music]
it has to be pretty high
that looks good
i think that works now then let's see
i'll make the second floor here this is
stage two
[Music]
okay it's finished now what should i add
to the second floor oh i know this can
be the place for a zombie security
system
where should i set it up somewhere
around here
i'll put the zombie generator here
let's see
[Music]
i think this will work
i'll place a treasure chest here
huh this looks like a good spot for a
button
now i just need a sign i have to write
something that'll make mikey want to
push the button no matter what
don't push
it's human nature to want to push
buttons you're not supposed to
now that i'm sure he'll push it it's
time to set up a little zombie surprise
for him when he does
yeah that looks right something like
this for the redstone torches
[Music]
that's perfect
[Music]
right here
that should work
now it's time to make a circuit like
this i'll also make good use of these
repeaters
there we go now that i've connected
everything i'm finally able to complete
my redstone circuit
next i have to set up the dispensers
all right i'm going to put as many
zombie spawn eggs as i can in here
now i'll sprinkle a bit of redstone dust
on top and that should complete the trap
if you press the button the signal will
course through the circuit and release a
whole bunch of angry zombies from the
dispensers
okay
all done my zombie surprise device is
finally complete next i'll cover up the
redstone circuit
[Music]
just press the button once and the
zombies will gush out endlessly i think
this trap will be super powerful
what next i probably should leave some
equipment for mikey inside this treasure
chest it'll be a nice little treat i'll
leave him something really awesome
that'll actually be useful
i think i'll throw in an iron sword an
iron helmet an iron chest plate iron
leggings and finally some iron boots
while we're at it why not give him some
golden apples
i think five golden apples should be a
big enough reward for him there my
second security system is complete stage
two is ready to go so i'll start working
on stage three
for this one i'll try an athletic
challenge he'll need to climb a spiral
staircase in order to clear the stage
spiral staircase parkour i should set it
up like this
i'll have the stairs go around the walls
here perfect
he'll go up like this
[Music]
the stairs will keep going up
[Music]
spiral staircase parkour
this might be too hard i'll try it
that's not bad
as long as you time it right
oh
that's tough i'll make it a bit easier
for mikey
[Music]
that works
hmm
[Music]
all right then
i'll start making a section for the
third floor
[Music]
i want it to look a little something
like this
okay
[Music]
i'm filling the floor in first
[Music]
there
when he clears the staircase he'll
arrive at this section of the third
floor i have an idea for when that
happens i'm gonna give mikey a choice
he'll have to choose between a wrong
answer and a right answer first i'll
split the room into two halves by
putting a wall through the middle
i'll divide this space with obsidian
that looks perfect you'll understand why
i'm doing this a little bit later on
let's see what should i be doing next i
need to present mikey with some options
to choose from
first i'll bring out some diamond door
second i'll make sure i have a couple of
blocks of coal
now then
[Music]
i'll get the diamond and the coal ready
like this
[Music]
there we go
that should work for now i'm gonna have
mikey dig through just one of these two
walls that's the choice he gets to make
it'll be his decision whichever one he
digs out that's the hole he goes through
what's next maybe i'll leave him an iron
pickaxe
[Music]
okay diamond or coal i want one of these
choices to be a win for him i think i'll
have it be the coal
that means i'm gonna have to make the
diamond choice the lose one behind the
diamond wall i'll have a massive pitfall
here's the thing it won't just be any
ordinary pitfall it'll be a super
dangerous one
i better not slip and step on this if i
do i'll have to redo the entire thing
from the beginning i'll go extra slow
i'll put pressure plates on top that way
if anyone steps on them they'll fall
down the tower along with all the tnt
okay great the first trap is ready
what should i do if mikey selects the
cold blocks since it's the wind section
i think i'll lower at one level just
like this
[Music]
one level right
here that's good there we go
what should i do next let's see i'll
install nine dispensers against the wall
around the entire room yeah that looks
pretty good
now i'll fill this section with water
okay the tnt launching device is almost
complete if you ride it it'll blast you
all the way to the top of the tower i'll
need to set it up so that it creates a
blast powerful enough to launch you all
the way up i should load up the
dispensers with some tnt i'll just
replace the empty ones
there we go what comes next
i'll lay out the redstone dust
good now for the button
perfect i have to make sure mikey
doesn't die here i'll give him a bunch
of enchanted golden apples
[Music]
here you go 13 should do
that should be good time to refocus on
the tnt launching device
[Music]
let's experiment and see how high up the
tower you can go
what 119.
okay i'm going to set the landing spot
at around 119 blocks just to be safe
i'll make it 112.
[Music]
nice
i'll make one of the landing spots
halfway up
okay
[Music]
that works i'll place some slime here to
act as a cushion
[Music]
this won't get us all the way to the top
so i'll make a water current elevator
here
okay
this glass will reach the ceiling
good good good good good
[Music]
there
[Music]
one more
[Music]
yes
this is perfect now i just need two
ingredients a water bucket and a little
bit of soul sand
[Music]
all right time to build this elevator
sweet
the entrance can go right at the bottom
here
will this let me get to the top
[Music]
whoa awesome why did it stop there
[Music]
all right i made it up the elevator is
complete let's check on this section on
the third floor
i want to see if i can still reach the
top with this launcher
i should widen this
[Music]
there
[Music]
that should do the trick after you
arrive at this stage the water elevator
will take you to the top floor wow it's
so fast
that's because of the soul sand
yes
now then for the roof i want mikey to
face a final boss
i know i'll make the final boss a wither
skeleton let's see
i think i'll give the boss a name to
keep it simple i'll call him boss
[Music]
great
how many wither skeletons should i
create
maybe two or three
i think i'll just have one
there's only a single final boss one
wither skeleton when mikey defeats him
he wins after that he'll be able to
collect the treasure as his final reward
[Music]
this will be a good spot to have the
chest right behind this gate
[Music]
that's perfect for the treasure i should
probably keep it simple how about
diamonds
yeah diamonds lots of them
the treasure's ready
where's the wither skeleton oh there it
is if mikey defeats this final boss he
wins he'll be able to claim the treasure
when he gets it he'll go straight down
wait a sec the wither skeleton's
following me that's not good i'm gonna
defeat him quickly
here's a new one
[Music]
i guess i should change where the
treasure is
i want to make something else over here
first things first something like this
[Music]
there an entrance when he's ready he can
go through these gates here
next i'll use some glass panes
like this
around here
this entire area
great now i'll install a button here
once the boss is defeated i want to make
the descent to the bottom really simple
just push this button and drop down
there we go
here i need to make something so you
don't take any damage when you hit the
ground
there well mine's done so i'm gonna go
take a look and see if mikey's finished
too uh is your tower done
i've been done for a while whoa i'm
feeling good about mine my security
tower is really difficult jj let's start
with mine okay i'll head into mikey's
security tower and try to get through it
let's go right away you'll find that my
security tower is tricky to get inside
good luck
i see can you find the entrance
is the entrance difficult to find
totally difficult i don't you'll find it
let's see
do you give up i told you it's difficult
it doesn't even look like there's a door
because there is none
there's no entrance right
this looks suspicious mikey what
found it huh here how'd you find it i
mean if you're sure that's it you can't
even fit through there huh how small is
it oh
what's wrong tiny you found it but you
can't get in
that's not true mikey i know how to get
in
here huh why like this
yeah i knew it ah you figured it out you
installed a trapped chest in the wall if
you open it up you can get in like this
oh
all you have to do is crouch i can get
in by crawling forward just like this
you're pretty smart for figuring that
out
i got inside good i expected that
this is your security tower yep i think
you can climb it oh vines huh do i climb
with the vines huh how'd you know i
thought you'd have more trouble finding
them oh well
they were pretty easy to find they're
the only green object in the room okay
i'm gonna climb the vines climbing them
is pretty interesting oh i made it to
the second floor
i expected you might make it this far
this is where the real challenge starts
and i see the real challenge huh what's
this for this
choose one go ahead choose what choose
one of the chests one of them is a win
and one of them is definitely not a win
you just have to pick one of the two
i see i have to choose between these
treasure chests that's right hmm so one
has rotten flesh and one has diamonds
huh yep that's right jj
i know there's a trick to this huh one
thing's clear about the diamond chest
i'm pretty sure it's a trap what um well
are you sure if you don't choose the
diamonds that means you pick the rotten
flesh i would definitely pick the
diamonds if i were you
hmm
but it's your decision jj the diamonds
are super suspicious i pick the rotten
flesh three two one open
whoa
i got some pretty good items from this
oh
a diamond sword and golden apples thanks
mikey
you're welcome i also got some slime
blocks what for yeah i wonder so this
diamond one isn't the winner try it all
right i'm pretty curious here i go three
two one open what there isn't anything
inside what about the diamonds
[Music]
so this wasn't the winner that's
dangerous well done
somehow i was able to see through
mikey's trap now we'll go to the next
stage what is it it gets tough from here
what are you gonna do i'll grab on to
those vines over there then i'll be able
to climb up but will i be able to reach
them exactly how will you get over there
i figured it out how remember those
slime blocks i got from the rotten flesh
treasure chest i'll place them over here
then hit this button oh
[Music]
you figured it out
very clever i really had to think about
it though this was pretty tricky thank
you oh parkour if i make one wrong step
i could be in big trouble i better be
extra careful can you make it to the top
just wondering is there a way i could
have reached it by now don't let your
guy down can you clear this
so hi
hold on a sec there are husks up here
are they bosses that's right the bosses
can you beat them there's treasure i'm
not doing anything and they're just
falling
really that's impossible you've got to
be kidding me one husk walked right off
the edge strange uh-oh one sec can i run
faster than a husk
i'll move like this
i'll knock them off oh i didn't even
need to thanks to this diamond sword i
win no fair i beat them you're good jj
you cleared my entire security tower if
you don't mind mikey there's a treasure
chest waiting for me i think i should
open it ready open
whoa
diamonds cool i got some diamonds and i
was able to get through mikey's security
tower this was really fun and there were
some tricky parts too really yep i want
to try yours jj let's check it out sure
next i'll have mikey try to get through
my security tower let's go
[Music]
this is the tower that i built i wonder
what you put at the top yeah let's go
give it a try all right looks fun
unlike mine your entrance is really
obvious are you sure that's not a
mistake it's fine mikey but be careful
this is still a security tower
[Music]
it has a lot of security it's a security
tower with a simple entrance so i can
just walk in no problem hmm okay then
here it goes great
open
wait a minute huh that's dangerous what
impressive i'm surprised that you
noticed it this means that there must be
another entrance then
you caught on pretty quick didn't you
well mikey go look for the other
entrance huh
water
what's this
huh what are you thinking it's gone
there is no entrance i circled around
the whole tower
[Music]
go take another look
[Music]
look carefully at the side i'm standing
on hmm
oh
i saw it from afar there's a button
should i press it sure go ahead three
two one i didn't door what the hell
you have to enter right away
[Music]
wow i'll be honest i didn't expect you
to get past this lava trap mikey it was
close you got into my tower safe and
sound great
keep going i wonder what's on the second
floor i'll check it out please continue
up the ladder mikey
what could possibly be waiting up there
i can't wait to find out
[Music]
[Applause]
this is the second floor check out the
chest wait there's treasure in here i
don't see anything too suspicious i'll
still be careful though sure three two
one whoa
are you sure that i can just take this
huh
what
whoa
this is so cool this equipment and these
golden apples are a gift from me to you
thank you i'm so happy what's next climb
these stairs
i'm curious hmm
this button says don't push
interesting you'd better not push it
then since it says so now i'm sure i'll
be fine against whatever comes at me i'm
strong i'll push it push it if you want
to your choice i think it'll be good
three two one wait nothing happened oh
no what's this a zombie i can defeat it
it's okay i'm strong i'm strong
yes i'm super duper strong mikey mikey
yes yeah
easy are you okay wait a sec there's so
many of them
[Music]
oh like he's eating a golden apple
unfortunately the zombies will continue
gushing out forever wait hold on there's
too many mikey
what smart moves crazy you didn't push
the don't push button you should
probably escape you're right but i have
to be careful oh i fell it's no use i'm
no good at parkour
hang on relax you can do this i can't
you're in trouble
don't run too much
don't tell me you're gonna
come on
relax
help me relax mikey
hang in there mikey
whoa
hurry and climb these stairs the zombies
are still spawning and they're starting
to fall off the ledge come on
you're right but don't let your guard
down
this is actually kind of fun
oh great job thank you mikey you've
cleared stage two and arrived at stage
three i made it through it was fun the
real challenge is still to come diamonds
yep cool yeah huh what for open the
chest first
oh
huh
there are golden apples in here yep
thanks and an iron pickaxe so i have to
choose one or the other right
wow you can only choose one mikey hmm
diamond or cool

yep besides diamonds are prettier than
coal true all right mikey went for the
diamond yeah i'm gonna cash
oh no he saw through my trap take a
diamond thank you
i'm surprised how fast you broke through
mikey nice yeah thanks whoa leave it to
me that was close impressive so it's
this one yeah you're right it's the cool
one i didn't expect you to figure this
one out mikey you did awesome yay i'm
doing good that's true in that case
what's this this is an emergency escape
device correct do i push this to go up
you might want to eat a golden apple
first okay i'll do that
okay three two one i'm excited
whoa
wow mikey that was pretty good you made
it up on your first try
this is pretty fun
[Music]
okay mikey you're so close to the top

gonna ride the elevator too
i thought i was finished but there's
something here
what now that's the boss careful not to
fall off the edge good luck
nice you took down the wither skeleton
that's terrific so did i clear it you

security tower
you did a lot better than i expected now
i have a little reward for you this one
three two one

all of them to you mikey thank you this
has been so much fun congratulations you
made it to the top i guess we both made
it to the top of each other security
towers let's go back to the ground i
made a device that will get us down
there really easily
how does it work you just stand here and
press the button sure i'll try go three
two one
oh you disappeared
i'll go down too incredible
whoa
there you have it today we both built
security towers and then had a security
tower showdown in the end we were both
able to clear all levels of each other's
security towers that means it was a draw
