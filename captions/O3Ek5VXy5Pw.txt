it's a great
day it's just a great day it's a great
freaking day we made it this far what's
going on guys and girls at Z switch
Force yeah Zach from switch Force about
to be Zach from switch Force because
it's the switch again it's switch to
double the fun double the graphics
double the chaos double the chaos double
the DK double the Mario Kart Double the
Metroid Prime double the what else could
be there no leaks all magic it is
Nintendo switch today we've made it this
far where were you on this day you're
here that's so amazing appreciate it so
much I could barely fall asleep last
night so bad so bad it's um it's 4:58
a.m. on the Pacific
coast and so here's the issue I fell
asleep at like 2: a.m. so I got you know
myself a solid 2 hours and 40 minutes of
sleep that's okay this day could not be
any better and like I think it really
hit me as I was laying there how
freaking crazy this this day is how
freaking incredible it is how great it
is that we made it this far how great it
is that switch Force like literally
lived throughout the entire switch
generation and I'm just so freaking
Overjoyed I think this day is amazing
and I think there's nothing that can
derail the hype uh I think today's show
is going to be absolutely phenomenal
we'll talk about predictions we can take
your predictions I don't have a bingo
card but I can basically give you my
bingo card um I think a lot of things
that people are talking about are not
going to happen and a lot of things that
people aren't talking about are going to
happen that's kind of where I'm at with
things um but I'm super super excited
Simon I really appreciate it it is super
early yeah it is 4:59 a.m. for me I know
7:59 a.m. for a lot of you maybe it's
even like 9:59 no what is it for y'all
in the UK uh
you're eight hours ahead of me I believe
so it should be
like 1 p.m
is will the pre-orders drop today I
don't
know is this live or is this
pre-recorded what do you think
Christopher we are live now
all right the biggest thing about the
day that I'm excited
for is DK I don't know I've got
myself very much believing that DK is
coming
today I don't know if that's right I
don't know if that's
wrong
but hey um
I'm really believing in the power of DK
right
now what happened to this post here let
me do this
again we are
now
live I mean hey if you're going to get
up at 5:00 a.m. for something you're
going get up at 4:40 a.m. it's it's this
is the perfect thing right like you
could not get any luckier than to be
here on the day that the Nintendo switch
2 direct uh is is taking place like
could you be any any luckier you you get
to be live at this time I know there's a
lot bad in the world I know there's a
lot scary and terrible at the same time
you got to live through the generation
where Nintendo made a console that goes
portable and also connects to your TV
you get to be alive during the time
where Nintendo makes its first 4K
console you get to be alive during any
time where Nintendo freaking rocks and
rolls this is about as crazy as it's
ever going to
get I think this is in many ways you
know a horrible era and in many
ways freaking crazy GameCube NSO Mario
Kart 9 like everything is
happening we are now live
with uh my cat is still sleeping my cat
is on cat time he was
like and I was like I know dude but we
got we got business to take care of all
right we got business to take care of
and we got 58 minutes till Mass Insanity
uh I've got a poppy doc pop soda I've
got a glass of Phoenix water and I've
got the lucky DK mug the lucky DK mug
filled with
some hot orange tea uh there's not a lot
of tea which is great
because that means no
leaks there's just oh I also have this
uh protein Shamrock Farms lactose free
protein drink I don't know what I'm
going to want to drink I think this is
going to be crazy and I think it is
going to be
I was going to make a video yesterday I
talked about it on good morning Mario I
was like oh doomsday worst case scenario
best case
scenario I think it's like inevitably
best case scenario I could it was hard
for me I was like what is the worst case
scenario the worst case scenario is that
we get the switch 2 and we get Mario
Kart 9 I mean like what is absolutely
the worst case scenario if you can
barely hear
me probably try
uh probably try turning up your volume
uh oh game Riot got something going on
maybe that's pretty
sweet we are at
home 2 a.m. in Honolulu hey you're
living the Hawaii
life uh worst case scenario is all
farming Sims no there's just no chance
so like that's that's what I like
to me it's like okay worst casee
scenario that I can think of can't
happen there's no no way for a worst
case scenario to really happen
it's it's just not yeah I mean preor
April 9th seems like the most likely
thing
um oh your invite was lost in the post
mine too mine has been lost for a long
long
time dude a new 3D DK will cure so
much so
much um here I can turn myself up I
guess I mean I can talk right into the
mic I I don't want to be like
peeking my sound is a bit low okay I
mean I I'll try turning it up I
mean we
can do that
a pilot wings no like see that's the
thing I was watching
um like the the early switch one
presentation I just think Nintendo's at
a different place I think Nintendo won't
do and can't do a lot of what they
did back then like I'm not saying it's
like a it was like a bad thing I'm not
saying they did terrible stuff back then
but I'm just saying like there's no way
that they would do what they did like
the the the perfect example is onew
switch I don't think there's any way
Nintendo releases a onew switch for
switch 2 based on where they're at like
I'm talking about who runs the company
I'm talking about how they feel about
their position in the
industry I'm talking about what where
they're operating from I'm talking about
based on what games they've released
over the last eight freaking years can
you believe it's been eight years where
were you eight years ago
where were you
2017 when when we did this for switch
one so for switch one this was in
January and for switch one I was there
it was like a live you know event I was
there um I I don't think I had this
hoodie this is like my lucky Nintendo
hoodie when I need there to be a good
direct but I don't think I had this then
I really kind of hate that it's says
Levis but I love everything else about
the hoodie you were in middle school
watching Ghost Robo seven years ago
Middle School it's pretty great middle
ah Middle
School I mean people are saying
pre-order
for uh April 9th I kind of believe that
oh let me just get out my three big
things
um like these are just my three big
predictions that I haven't Hur anywhere
else uh
one 3D
DK two nend dogs three
$430 you don't see the Levis logo
appreciate it
man Xbox game pass coming uh I mean I
haven't heard anything specific about 4K
but I fully think 4K is coming
um unless
people are all crazy it really does seem
like this will be a docked 4K console
not portably of
course yeah it's been a long time huh SE
seven eight years it is a long
time why Nintendo dogs I just think
they're going to bring that IP back I
think it's odd that it skipped the whole
switch
generation and I think
that uh I think that they will have a
casual game but I don't think it'll be
as casual as one two switch going back
and seeing some of that man it's like I
don't know I don't know how they put
that game
out how did they put out a game where
you melt the
cow the Quick Draw shoot each other game
I don't think that works
nowadays see the reason I think 430 is
because then a $70 game bundle makes
it500
00 and because I feel like 430 is a
Nintendo
price um I don't like anything that
we've seen lately on
switch I don't think you're going to get
so I I don't think there's going to be
Zelda what's up super tener thank you so
much appreciate it yeah I do think 4K
doc doesn't important especially to try
to get all like the the third party
games I mean to
me like we all are kind of like oh yeah
Nintendo's going to have these cool
third party games they're going to have
ELD in the ring they're going to have
Final Fantasy but I'm telling you
like getting that actually and thinking
about getting it are going to be very
different like if today we do see Call
of Duty or cyberp Punk or elen ring or
Assassin's Creed Shadows or Monster
Wilds like these games that are very big
and are very much associ iated with the
other consoles the other platform
holders man oh man it will really change
the game and maybe that sounds crazy but
the issue
is Nintendo has not done that so getting
it done actually getting it done is
going to be a big deal and 4K docked and
portable is going to be a very big deal
um I I really don't think there's going
to be anything Zelda
today maybe this guy instead 50 minutes
by the way 50 minutes until all chaos
Breaks
Loose you thought last week's direct was
cool no you didn't I don't think anybody
really loved last week's direct but
that's okay the issue is it was just
like a fill in a must do had to get it
done um this the channel name does not
change I think we can still be
switchforce because it's the switch 2 if
it was like you know the attach or
whatever
eh but they're keeping it switch to so
we can keep
it time is going slow dude time is
moving so fast I feel like we just got
that trailer a little bit
ago look I I think it's all about new
games I I I think ports are going to be
side taed for later think about the
switch one direct the switch one
presentation right
it wasn't like they started showing you
the ports of Mario 3D World and Captain
Toad treasure Tracker and all that they
were like boom Mario Odyssey boom arms
what's the arms going to be today what's
the one that's like kind of crazy what's
the one that's kind
of quirky but maybe has a chance to hit
big my pick right now groi is 3D
DK I know 3D Mario is what everybody
thinks and I'm not saying that they
don't show 3D Mario but I think
I think it's going to be DK I I think DK
is going to be the big push this year it
makes sense like if there's a DK
game it comes out
now if there is
like it makes much more sense for
Nintendo to line up DK with the DK Park
launching and 3D Mario with the Mario
movie so the Mario movie is supposed to
drop next spring so I think probably 3D
Mario drops next spring and this just
like dawned on me a few days ago but 3D
Mario coming in like March matches up
TimeWise from a June launch to a March
Mario as when Nintendo launched in a
March switch and a November
Mario silk song today I think is like a
guarantee I mean I suppose there's a
chance we just get a little peak of it
but I think it's getting dated today I
don't know I think I think if Nintendo
is going to ever talk about it it's
today GameCube seems like it is actually
happening I think GameCube on switch 2
NSO is going to be a cool deal getting
those games that you've wanted
forever but you don't have to really pay
for them I think is a great trade right
we didn't get Wind Waker or Twilight
Princess or metric Prime 2 during this
switch one era we
didn't
but we get them on
NSO and NSO value has been going
up let's let's be real the only thing we
care about today is themes come on let's
be real the only thing that matters is
do we get our themes today where are our
themes please bring me themes the switch
has like the saddest home screen
ever can we can we agree with that can
we agree that like the switch is great
but the home screen with either dark or
light background is very
sad come on man we need some themes we
need some themes and we need some
uh we need some not super expensive
themes and I want like I want themes
that have some motion to it appreciate
it man thank you you're
welcome it's been a long time I I feel
like the last 18 months of Nintendo has
been like a grueling grind like it's
been prison mic up in
here geez o pets it has been slow but
this day has been like man I've been
I've been telling my mom about this day
for years we've been talking about this
day for
years goodness gracious like it has
taken forever to get here but now we're
here and it's kind of crazy it kind of
feels
crazy that we're going to see it all
today we're going to see price we're
going to see release date we're going to
see games we're going to see the C
button we're going to see the mouse
functionality and we're going to see it
all in 45
minutes
not three
months hey what are we really hating on
the
themes how are you going to hate on the
themes themes are a beautiful thing
obviously the most important thing is
the
games want that drain the battery I
don't care take all my battery
themes themes being bought with points
would be probably
good thanks Mr sloth it's going to be a
crazy day for a sloth like
you uh the Nintendo Today app yeah I
don't know maybe they're going to give
you a free C button
wallpaper I don't know what the C button
is going to be I mean I think it's got
something to do with multiplayer in any
way like right that could be voice chat
that could be freaking a community Hub
that could
be sharing screen I don't we'll we'll
freaking find
out I don't I don't think okay so
like I'm curious how crazy Nintendo
wants to go because again they're in a
different position and I think that's
important when the switch one came out
it was like I don't know will people
care and and luckily they did now it's
like people care people really care
they've got a lot writing on this so I
think maybe they do go a
bit maybe they go a bit deeper and by
that I mean like maybe they do tease
something for
2026 maybe they tease something that's
just
undated we'll have to wait and see could
they tease Animal Crossing could they
tease Smash Brothers could they tease
Zelda I suppose I think it's unlikely oh
yeah we're going to see the Pro
Controller the freaking Pro Controller
does that Pro Controller split like the
joy-con does the Pro Controller well the
Pro Controller we know is going to have
that headphone jack we saw that leaked
uh from the well it's not really leaked
it's like just posted from the FCC
listing the new Pro Controller the Pro
Controller is so sick man let's see I
got one right here on my desk always a
Pro Controller laying around and always
face down cuz my cat loves to chew the
Nubs oh yes the Pro Controller Is So Pro
also no drift on your
joy-con that's pretty great that's
pretty crazy I
mean Animal Crossing like see I think
the thing that people are going to have
to get out of the way I I hope I believe
is that
Nintendo is not going to be crazy Port
heavy this time so when we're talking
about like oh wanting these games from a
few years ago wanting these games from
seven eight years ago I don't think
we're getting them
anymore which to me is a great thing I
think getting a ton of new games is
going to be fantastic what would
disappoint me about today's direct if it
was
cancelled I think this direct is one
that has multiple freakout moments like
I'm just most excited I was thinking
about when I was laying in bed last
night unable to sleep I was like
what are they going to
do right because think about the switch
one start okay breath of the wild was
pretty crazy it was like this Zelda
game where it was more open world where
you approached it how you wanted to open
it and approach
it and then they have this arms game
where you're fighting with arms which is
crazy and kind of
unpredictable they had
Mario Odyssey which I guess was kind of
just like the next 3D Mario but we had
seen breath of the wild for many months
leading up to the switch one reveal even
right we'd seen it for Wii U we've
literally seen 7 Seconds of Mario Kart 9
from like a very pull out perspective
and all we know is DK got a little crazy
that's all we know about Mario Kart 9
right so we're going to see all this
stuff for the first time what are these
games going to look like what are going
to be the innovations that
Captivate Us that draw Us in that make
us excited that make you smile that make
somebody scream like what are they going
to show today that does that game
right's asking if I think Nintendo
worries about GTA 6 I mean I don't think
they're releasing anywhere near it I
think do they worry about it like do
they get
it pro I
mean what are the odds of GTA 6 on
switch
2 honestly I hope that they're high I I
I mean can there just be a like I don't
again like my big thing with this
console is I don't want to be sitting
here saying well we'll get the last
version you know they're getting Call of
Duty 2026 and we're getting Call of Duty
infinite Warfare right they're getting
monster Jer wilds and we're getting
Monster hner
World so I don't know specifically with
GTA 6 but I think this console is a huge
success if we get to that point right
[Music]
you're excited for the Goofy and
unpredictable games yeah like what can
Nintendo do that's like you can't
predict nobody could have predicted arms
or one two switch
right heck back in the day nobody could
have predicted Splatoon I remember when
Splatoon was announced I was like what
the actual heck Nintendo made a shooter
and you're just splatting paint
everywhere and then I played it at E3
and it was freaking great and look what
they've evolved Splatoon into look what
spun is built into look what they've
made that franchise and that
character pretty crazy they could do
that again like obviously yes today's
show will rely a lot on Nintendo's
trusted IP and beloved characters but I
think there's a chance to do something
brand new I think there's a chance to do
yeah like a funky game showing up Mouse
functionality exactly JS exactly
something like that but not like one two
switch because in hindsight what the
heck were they doing
we are 38 minutes away from this chaos
y'all can give me your big predictions
in the comments like I told you my three
that are just kind of more for me are 3D
DK nintend Dogs and $430 I I'll be glad
to be wrong about 430 and it's actually
400 I will not be happy if I'm wrong
about DK at this point like I've hyped
myself into wanting DK more than 3D
Mario so
because what does a 3D DK look
like well we know that it he's got the
crazy
eyebrows I think there's a significant
third party portion today so I think
silong has a chance but I also think
Halo has a chance cyber Punk has a
chance Elder ring has a
chance I've heard nothing about storage
but it's got to be decently big yeah the
game have to be substantially bigger
right I like I'll give it a shot but I
really hope it's not switch
Sports I really hope that there's not
anything switch sports like sports
related we've done switch Sports we did
wi
Sports we don't need another sports game
we don't like that's what I'm saying
like Define this console with new ideas
Define this console with yeah Mario Kart
n that's a great
opener the power of the DK mug is just
too strong it is this mug comes into my
life and everything becomes DK will we
see Phil Spencer probably not
but
like I really want
Halo to come to switch just for like the
the power that that moment has but I
think it's so important that Nintendo
brings
out new games like we better see a shot
of Assassin's Creed Shadows 2 Assassin's
Creed Shadows running on switch 2 we
better see a shot of Monster Hunter
Wilds do the games matter the games
absolutely matter I'm not buying a
console without without the games to me
like system sellers are one of the
saddest things that have gone
missing like when you were going to buy
Xbox series X or PS5 what was the system
seller Demon Souls remake come on
now scuba matics thank you so much
Metroid fans have been patiently waiting
I think absolutely you get Metroid PR 4
today I think
absolutely Metroid Prime 4 should factor
in heavily I think it's going to be a
launch
title do we see Red Dead Redemption
2 like yes that would be cool but I part
of me hopes
no part of me hopes that it's only like
relevant new 2025 third party games like
Elden ring is the one that I will give
an exception for because it's Elden ring
and I think that's just I don't know I
think that's just a big thing Nintendo
did you know Dark Souls remastered on
switch I I think Elden the ring is a big
thing Nintendo likes their band
dnos I think the focus of this is the
games Mike actually I think the F the
hardware Focus was that
trailer that they posted back in
January I think today I mean I think
there's going to be yeah 7 to 10 minutes
about the the hardware but I think today
is mostly games we got nothing on games
nothing they're trying to advertise me
smoothies on my phone nectar juice bar
5:25
a.m. that does sound pretty good right a
smoothie you know what else is cool
today they're also revealing the new set
for Star Wars
unlimited y'all probably don't care but
I'm super pumped for that the game has
become my my life that's an 11 a reveal
for me so in six more hours favorite
switch one moment thanks Max cozy uh my
favorite switch one moment besides the
reveal that's probably the greatest
freakout moment
[Music]
um I would say probably my favorite
switch one moment is me Jake and Gabe
all getting together in person for the
launch like we did switch Force for the
first six months
remote but then we all got to the same
place for the launch which was just
really fun we had you know our shirts
made we all got our consoles in the same
night it was really
fun what's up Edith glad to have you
here glad to have you here
Steph where are the pre-orders going up
we don't know yet I mean I'm sure it's
going to be The Usual Suspects right
Walmart Target Best Buy
Amazon the the latest news is that the
pre-orders are April 9th so we'll wait
and see I mean we'll see if the the
pre-orders go out today I think that's
very likely but I think it's also very
likely that they're April 9th that seems
to be the word on the
street um hoping for a new Animal
Crossing title I think eventually
there'll be a new Animal Crossing I
don't think it's today though like
Nintendo's got a slow rle this I think
they've got a bunch of big games but I
think they go heavy on Mario I think
they go heavy on
Metroid like the other thing is they
have a Mario Kart game being shown
today like let's think about the
magnitude of that
Mario Kart
8 came out what 13 years
ago
2012 Mario Kart 8 sold 60 million copies
on the
switch and we're getting a new Mario
Kart 2014 okay it's not as old 11 years
though Mike what's up Destiny was crazy
dude that was such a different time I
was traveling constantly in the destiny
I remember I played Destiny
So Random aside I played
Destiny at the top floor of this super
tall building in Los
Angeles and it seemed like the greatest
thing
ever then it came out I mean I know a
lot of people love Destiny and
eventually evolved to be a cool game
Destiny 2 and whatever but I'm telling
you like the destiny one that I played
on the top floor of that
building that Destiny was going to be
insane and then it it just wasn't
but 30 minutes till Mario
Kart 32
minutes I think that's like a big deal
it's kind of being overlooked because
it's like oh yeah Mario Kart they showed
it
off Mario freaking Kart a new Mario Kart
dang man that's pretty crazy you're
going to see the next Mario Kart after
60 million units that's a lot of
pressure imagine you show up to work
right whatever you're working on I don't
know whether you're a teacher an
engineer whether you work at the
freaking burger and Fry
Shack imagine if they were like hey 60
million people bought what you did
last now do it better it's a lot of
pressure it's a lot of pressure but what
I really love is that Nintendo has been
super creative and in the face of
pressure I feel like they've taken risks
like I feel like tears of the Kingdom
tried to be even crazier than breath of
the wild I feel like Mario Wonder tried
to be way
crazier than what Mario did before and
something that's very hard I think for
companies especially gaming
companies they're like money is so
important success is so important the
industry isn't always up down all around
we got to do what works and I feel like
Nintendo hate him or love him whatever
you know your cup of tea is in terms of
game preference
they try new stuff they try to to follow
the the beat of Their Own Drum they try
to walk their own path and I think
that's so
crazy welcome from Canada welcome from
all over this is a global Nintendo
Community C is for Community C is
for craft C is for cookie a cookie
button
C is
for close the
switch it starts in 30 minutes exactly
my friends 30 minutes until we are
freaking there which is crazy CU I
started streaming 32 minutes ago so more
than more than half times passed before

an audio check Let's uh let's do a
little audio check here

won't put my foot in my mouth I'm from
Phoenix so let's see I was from when the
switch won I was
from
La the Wii U I was
from ironically LA but different
different
times the
Wii I was
from
Indiana the GameCube I was from
Michigan the N64 I was from
Michigan the Super
Nintendo I was
[Music]
from Wisconsin or no Illinois I was from
Illinois North Carolina baby I love the
energy
got some indianas there dude you're
going to the switch to experience you
lucky
duck I think I've move I've moved like
18 times in my life or something like
that it's been pretty
crazy pretty
crazy where in Michigan uh I lived in
Rochester
Hills Manila that's freaking
awesome Missouri all right California we
got people all over this is great I feel
like the I feel like the switch
audience just a great group of people
y'all are so great I'm very excited for
today to just be the start of a new
generation I mean literally in
figuratively right like it's a fresh
start it's a fresh start for Nintendo
it's a fresh start for I feel like it's
a fresh start for the channel I feel
like it's a fresh start for the gaming
industry I feel like this I mean between
this and GTA 6
money is to be made this
year I think it's been a strong start so
far I think another good thing is going
to be
like last week you were like oh Nintendo
is rhythm having an tomadachi life which
no shade to those
games but today is going to
be Nintendo is a way different right I
feel like Nintendo has been in Coast
mode mode for 18 months I feel like
Nintendo has been
in Kickback and relax mode for 18 months
and I feel like today they're like we're
putting the pedal to the metal I think
the Nintendo you see today is a very
aggressive excited passionate Forward
Thinking Nintendo and the Nintendo that
we've gotten used to for the last 18
months is more of a like kind of a weird
Nintendo MSU man let's go hopefully
that's for Michigan
State couldn't get their shots to fall
against Auburn but yeah I think I think
Nintendo today is
like we are ready to roll 80 miles an
hour Scotty I appreciate it thank you

2031 oh Cody you got nothing to worry
about hopefully this D will be better

23
minutes that's awesome so the different
people that are talking about places in
Michigan I know all of those I remember
all those very fondly I lived in
Michigan from 7 age s to uh
14 so I would say that's like the most
formative years of my
life so that feels like my
home I was also born in Michigan but we
moved shortly
after a new Luigi's Mansion I think it
be I
mean it's been how long when did Luigi's
Mansion come out 2019

Generations are so crazy okay cuz I've
been I started YouTube during the Wii
era what the heck why did I move so many
times I mean my dad's job and then I
moved a lot because YouTube I could kind
of live anywhere so I was just like
testing it
out like my family was never the like
put down Our Roots family and there's
good and bad to that oh I'm definitely
Lions fan biggest lions fan here if this

GameCube on NSO today I think they have
to announce it right if they're talking
about why NSO is better on switch 2
GameCube games GameCube games like to me
GameCube games that's where they can
bring in the nostalgic flare we don't
need remakes we don't need ports give us
the GameCube games on NSO let us access
those all and we be ready to go oh it's
black dark smoke what is up Rock City
New York in the building it we can

the countdown's over man what are you
going to do now thanks for being here
popping in saying hi today is going to
be a crazy day so freaking excited we
are 19 minutes away oh my
gosh I remember freaking out when the
switch was announced that's probably the
biggest freakout I had on on like
camera all the love from Michigan and
Detroit let's go it's raining it's
raining probably the the sweat of Dan
Campbell
yeah I cannot stay up there's no I mean
all all nighter I'm very excited for
this direct but I need to sleep I don't
want to get sick I don't want to be over
tired I don't want to be
cranky I want to be ready to go got your
wallets ready hopefully you all got your
breakfast ready I don't know about PR
day I do think every switch to first
party game is going to be 70 bucks
digital Dazzle thank you appreciate you
dazzling us with your presence and I'm
glad I can Dazzle you with this channel
um yeah I think switch force is going to
grow today so we'll talk about that
later do I think the the C button stands
for
control knowing Nintendo it's going to
be something really weird like chat is
too obvious connect is too OB I mean
connect connect is still my pick but
knowing Nintendo it's going to be
something like
Cornucopia Potter guys you're here let's
go let's go you have an hour good this
thing is an hour well not starting now
but you know what I mean C is for
Community I mean that seems like a great
pick but I feel like with Nintendo
it's going to be something else what do
we think the price is going to be
everybody just thinks 400 right does
anybody think it's going to be more than
400 I do I'll be glad to be wrong about
this one but I think it's more than
$400 and then release date June 5th June
12th May
15th it better not be a screen cap
button I've seen multiple people people
say that now no way switch Nexus thank
you okay so we do have some people
saying 450 we do have some people saying
more than 400 okay so you I think that's
reasonable I think you're putting
yourself in a good spot to me if it's
400 huge win we're feeling
great but I've always said expect 450
anything above is ick anything below is
good if it's 500 I will kind of be
shocked if if this system is 500 bucks
without a game right like 500 with Mario
Kart shirt but if it's 500 without a
game I will be shocked that's $570 to
play something on your switch 2 holy
crap I want this thing as quickly as
possible so I would love for it to be in
May but but
June am I crazy it would be June
5th yeah June 5th or June 12th it's a
Thursday all right let's get uh locked
and loaded here let's get
small look at that beautiful white
screen Nintendo Direct Nintendo switch 2
remember how many times remember how
many times these freaking Nintendos have
told us there will be no mention of the
the successor of the Nintendo switch
remember how many times they've said
that come on guys how how crazy was that
y'all to keep telling us you're not
going to get anything cool
today you're not going to get what you
want today they told us that for like a
year over and over again there'll be no
mention of the successor to the Nintendo
switch come on man how about today how
times have changed all there will be is
a mention of the successor to the
Nintendo switch console everything that
we say is going to be the successor to
the Nintendo switch console everything
oh I just lit up your dark room boom
yeah we got this big white screen
we ready to rock and roll oh baby it's
so
close less than 15 minutes it's the
switch to direct do you guys understand
yes you do but do you understand yes you
do but you know what I'm saying like
we're here this is freaking crazy the
next six seven eight years of Nintendo
are being dictated by
today show up and show out or sit down
Nintendo like I expect big things from
them
I absolutely love Nintendo but I also
absolutely expect big things if they
like underd deliver which I think
there's 0% chance they do but if they
underd deliver I would be
devastated I will
100% expect amazingness there's got to
be big first-party games there's got to
be big third party games there's got to
be a beautiful console a release date a
price they've got to show us why the
online is improved they've got to show
us everything they need to really up the
ante this needs to be a better direct
than anything we got in the switch ERA
this has to be a better direct than
anything we
got in the last eight
years like this should be the best
presentation since the switch one
reveals
stream and that was pretty darn good we
got to see a beautiful look at breath of
wild we got to see Mario Odyssey we got
to see commitments from third parties
that we did not think were going to be
on there because the Wii U was so bad we
got to see arms we got to see Splatoon 2
we got to see one two switch which at
the time we were like oh dude I cannot
believe that
they released onew
[Music]

Nintendo

get ready they have dude you could see
Halo on your Nintendo console today you
could see Halo and master chief on your
Nintendo console today and we're getting
a new Mario Kart

win

dude DK needs to be here I know we're
going to see Mario Kart I know we're
going to see Metroid but I wantan to
thanks John you have a great day too
appreciate you stopping in like I want
to see DK racing his cart and then they
like Freeze Frame and DK steps off the
cart and walks into his game imagine if
every trailer linked to the next trailer
someone should do this Nintendo do
this like cinematically link all your
trailers so it's like one shot wouldn't
that be the greatest Nintendo Direct
ever like DK pulls up in his cart gets
off and walks into his own game and
then I don't know like Samus is like
perched watching DK I'm not saying like
they're actually in the game right but
like just for the Cinematic of the show
the trailers are all
linked dude absolutely switch 2 is going
to be 4K odds of a remake today I hope
zero I don't want any remakes not today
save the remakes for some other time
not today we don't need the remix we
need juicy mouthwatering 4K we need Doom

if you were together in the same room
play together or compete in online
multiplayer Gam
I mean yes people will just use Discord
your person
faor and I love how they're not spoiling
any your own for a retro game
competition or hold a sports competition
between
families all together anytime so is for
chat game chat wow they really just went
with the most obvious
thing what did you think in developing
game chat our goal was for you to enjoy
playing online with others more closely
including family and friends almost as
if you're all playing together in the
same
place the camera you saw in the trailer
is the Nintendo switch 2
camera which will be available on the
same day as switch 2 definitely not
buying
that a Nintendo switch online membership
will be required to use game
chat however since we'd like as many
people as possible to experience game
chat it will be available without a
membership for a limited time oh okay
that's nice we hope you'll try it
out additionally game chat supports the
Nintendo switch parental controls app
and different settings can be adjusted
for example whether parental permission
is always required when a child wants to
use game chat to play with their
friends we'd like to introduce another
new experience you can share with family
and friends
on Nintendo switch even if you just have
one game you can pass a joy-con
controller to a friend and play together
but on Nintendo switch 2 you can play
together locally on multiple systems
using just one game yes with game share
let go even games that require multiple
screens can be played if one person owns
a compatible game with game share you
can temporarily share compatible games
with others who also have Nintendo
switch 2 or a Nintendo switch system yep
that's awesome you can share a game with
up to three other systems at time that's
awesome oh they did the scre supports
online play with other switch 2 systems
and you can use it with friends via game
chat which we showed earlier game share
game share can only be used with
compatible games this feature is planned
for several titles starting with a free
update for Clubhouse games 51 worldwide
Classics on Nintendo
switch game share support is also
planned for select games exclusive to
Nintendo switch 2 so we hope you'll look
forward is useful up
next we'd like to show you the Nintendo
switch 2 system itself yeah and show us
the UI please take a
look same

screen here's how that compares to

much as you just saw Nintendo switch 2
isn't simply an improved Nintendo
switch we redesigned the system from the
ground up and packed in lots of new
gameplay features USB and to help
players better understand the switch 2

them what are the magnet this sign reads
where are the magnets oh where are I was
going to say what what is the joyon 2
controllers attach to the system with
magnets yes and those magnets are inside
the
system the SL and Sr buttons on the
joycon 2 are made of metal the suit is
SW so that's how they attach to the
system a magnetic circuit is formed
between them so they won't easily
science
class through examining signs like these
you can discover all sorts of secrets
about Nintendo switch 2 what is this
another example the joycon 2 controllers
have Mouse controls and when combined
with the gyroscopes you can even do
something like
this you can adjust the position of the
golf club and aim for the Cup by
rotating the joyon 2 oh that was a
horrible
shot by combining the mouse controls and
gyroscopes things like this are possible
so there's like little mini games there
are secrets to discover even as you're
playing Mini games and Tech demos okay I
mean this is like one to some of the
secrets range from the unique features
of the system to Tiny details you might
