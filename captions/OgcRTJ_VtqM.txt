In finally. Hi. Missed you. With this
feature, you'll be able to communicate
with friends and family while playing a
game. Should we follow you? Yeah.
Okay. For an adventure.
While using the game chat feature, your
voice is recognized by a microphone to
the system. Oh, okay. But you're still
behind me, right? Oh, that's cool. You
don't need a headset. It can pick up
your speaking voice clearly, even from a
distance. Look at this. Jump on here.
All right. Let's keep going. It's
coming. Let's make a left right here.
Let's make a When it's noisy around you,
your voice will still come through
clearly. Chat with ease. What do you
have? The Nvidia RTX. Okay, nice. It
does look beautiful. It's okay. And you
can use this feature in handheld mode,
too, letting you easily chat with the
Nvidia tech. That's what I'm saying. If
you open the chat menu and turn on game
screen sharing. Great job. Good job.
There we go. It's just Discord. Also
share your game screen. Did you see
someone just like go on top of that
dinosaur? Really? They could do that.
They can do it, you guys. I just did it.
I want to do it. Now, could you make it
proximity chat? Oh, he trying to eat me.
He's trying to eat me. Okay, I got it. I

Yay. Okay.
You can chat to your heart's content. I

We're safe. We're safe. Kirby, look.
You're a star. That's so cute. So cute.
You can adjust the size of your game
screen. Good. I was going to say if you
couldn't adjust it, that'd be dumb. I'm
lost. Like, where' you go?
Yeah, the frames do be crying when you
uh or expand another friend's game
screen. Your friend needs to [ __ ] be
docked in above that wall. Use the
[ __ ] dongle, you [ __ ] Your
quality looks like [ __ ] This is where I
have to do a little wall ride
so everyone can watch them play. Chad,
that's not a Switch thing. That's or the
console thing. That is a internet thing
cuz you're trying to share [ __ ]
screen on a handheld. Let's take a
picture here. And if you have [ __ ]
Wi-Fi,
oh yo, that's sick. I like your pose,
Meeks. On the right Joycon 2 controller,
there's an additional button. With the C
button, you can pull up a chat menu.
Oh, dang. A really cool. Wait, actually,
guys, uh I got a call coming right now,
so uh I'll be right back. Yeah. Oh,

This is Nvidia. Oh, this is 100% Nvidia.
This is good. You can appear on screen.
Zoom is dead. We're all doing zooms
through switch now.
Here's how it looks with just the camera
feed.
There you go. Wow. Can you wait for me?
Please look forward to games. I actually
love that camera feed like this. I
actually love that. Yeah. Chad, don't do
this with strangers. Wait, wait, wait.
This is huge for collabs. I go a little
more this way.
Using game chat, even when you're apart,
you can play games and hang out as if
you were together in the same room. I
love that. I love that. Play together or
compete in online multiplayer games.
Wow, personal favorites.
[Music]
Decide your own rules for a retro game
competition.
or hold a sports competition between
families. Yeah, I got it, Simba. Agreed.
All together, anytime,
anywhere. Game chat. I love
that. Now, make it easier to invite my
friends. What did you think? In
developing Game Chat, our goal was for
you to enjoy playing online with others
more closely, including family. It's a
good feature. Almost as if you're all
playing together in the same place.
Honestly, a feature that a lot of other
consoles have had, but you know. Hey,
Rema, thank you for the camera you saw
in the trailer is the Nintendo Switch 2
camera
which will be available. I'm sorry. Did
anyone see that the graphic itself was
having frame lighting issues? Did anyone
see that? Was that just me? A Nintendo
Switch online membership required to use
Game Switch, please. However, since we'd
like as many people as possible to
experience Game Chat, it will be
available for a limited time. It's not
even It's not even a game. Right.
Additionally, game chat supports the
Nintendo Switch controls and different
settings. Huge for that camera thing.
Parental permissions always child wants
to play with their friends. Parents,
if your kid has a Switch introduce
another new experience that family and
friends, you better you better enable
that thing.
On Nintendo Switch, even if you just
have one game, you can pass a Joy-Con
controller to a friend and play it
together. But on Nintendo Switch 2, you
can play together locally on multiple
systems using just one game. That's
awesome. With Game Share. [ __ ] yeah.
Fire. As shown here, games that require
multiple if one person owns a compatible
game. Really
share compatible games with others also
have Nintendo Switch or a Nintendo
Switch system. You can share a game with
up to three other systems at a time.
Game share also supports online play
with other Switch 2 systems and you can
use it with friends via game chat which
we showed earlier. What game share can
only be used with compatibility online?
This feature is planned for several
titles starting with a free update for
clubs 51 worldwide classics on Nintendo
Switch. What game? Share support is also
planned for select games, bro. They took
a page out of uh you'll look forward the
studio behind it takes two and split
fiction.
We'd like to show you the Nintendo
Switch 2 system itself. Bet. Show it to
me. Please take a look. Oh god. Here we
go.

bigger built-in screen. I can tell it's
not OLED. How that compares to Nintendo
Switch. I can tell it's not remains the
same.

approximately double the pixels compared
to Switch, you can enjoy games in
greater detail. 1080p 1080p. 1080p.

game chat. Classic DSi. It also uses
noise cancelling technology to filter so
your voice will come through clearly.
Ooh, 3D audio. Even if you don't have a
surround, please games can be enjoyed
with more. I can't wait to play Repo on
my Switch as if it were coming from all
around you. Fire. Are you going to have
actual Nintendo headphones? Cuz I will

stand.
You can move it freely like this. Look

ports in addition to the USBC port found
on the bottom of the system. Oh, they

dock it and then Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Okay. Okay. It's handy for connecting a
USBC camera. Like I said, fellas
or charging in tabletop mode. Yes, that
is also super helpful.
Larger. Wo. Nintendo Switch 2 comes with
256 GB of storage. That's great. Eight
times that of Nintendo Switch. That's
great for storing your game downloads
without having to get a [ __ ] uh micro
SD card. That's actually huge. Reading
and writing data is also faster. Oh, did
we not?
What are you talking about? 4K. What are
you talking about? What are you
resolution? What the [ __ ] What do you
mean? What do you mean? What? What are
you talking
about? What the [ __ ] The Nintendo
Switch that keeps your system cool. This

[Music]
As you just saw, Nintendo Switch 2 isn't
simply an improved Nintendo Switch. I'm
going to throw up. We redesigned the
system for this huge and packed in lots
of new gameplay. The Wii U wishes. And
to help players better understand the
Switch 2 hardware, we're currently
developing this game.
Mr. Kawamoto, what the [ __ ] are you
talking about? Hello.
Mario is actually inside the game
itself. Mario Paint. Oh, this is
Nintendo Switch 2 welcome tour. It's
Astrobot exclusive to Nintendo Switch 2.
It's [ __ ] Astrobot.
I'm standing over here.
Okay, everyone, join me inside the game.
Damn, if we would have put that sim like
[ __ ] game. There are a lot of
question mark icons here. Let's examine
them.
Where are the magnets? This sign reads,
"Where are the magnets? New IP. Are we
really calling this a new
IP? Are we really calling this a new IP?
And those magnets are inside the system.
The SL and
SRP are made of metal. Come on. Come on,
guys. How they attach to the system.
A magnetic circuit is formed between
them. They won't easily detect. We've
called out a lot of stuff. What do we
need? What do we need? through examining
Banjo
Remover 10 dogs. It's all happening.
This is it. Another example, the Joy-Con
2 controller.
And when the only 20 minutes, you can do
something like this. It's only been 20
minutes. You can adjust the position of
the golf club and aim for the golf. Why
would you do that? The whole point of
motion controls by combining the mouse
controls. We're getting golf with
friends on Switch, aren't we? Possible.
Okay, secrets to discover even as you're
playing mini games and tech demos.
Some of the secrets range from the
unique features of We got bingo already.
Tiny details you might notice. Yeah,
because I put all the [ __ ] Yeah, holy
crap. We got bingo. Nintendo Switch 2.
Welcome to our paid digital game on the
same day. I can't believe we got bingo
and it's only been 20 minutes. You're
interested. Now, I'd like to share some
more information regarding Nintendo
Switch 2.
Okay. This is the game card for Nintendo
Switch 2 titles. Okay.
It's the same shape as Nintendo Switch
game cards. Okay. But it's red. Red. And
it has much faster data reading speed.
Awesome.
Next up is additional storage. I mean, I
still have mine. Switch 2 will only work
with micro SD Express cards, right? Oh,
Express cards. a different type of SD
card and will make high-speed data
transfers possible.
Oh is mine. Please note that regular
micro SD cards used for Nintendo Switch
will not be compatible. Oh, gotcha.
Okay. Additionally, to transfer data
from Switch to Switch 2, you can log
into your Nintendo account to use the
system transfer feature. Yeah, that is a
bit that that part does suck, but I get
it. I'm assuming it's digital games.
They didn't state if this has a solid
state. Also releasing a new pro
controller. I I like that. It looks a
little different. C button which
launches game chat. And on the back
there are new GR buttons which you can
use to assign existing button control.
No, they didn't.
In addition, an audio jack has been
added. We've introduced a few new
features and after today's presentation,
the official Nintendo Switch 2 website
will go live. There will also be an Ask
the Developer article on the website
where the three of us will talk about
the development of Nintendo Switch 2. We
hope you'll check that out as well.
And now, the Nintendo Switch 2 launch
day.
Nintendo Switch. Nintendo Switch 2
launches on June 5th. What the [ __ ] are

forward to the day when you all get to
experience it. So, please wait just a
bit longer. What do you mean?
No way. That's so What the [ __ ] That's
two months. On Nintendo Switch 2, you
can play three types of games. Okay. The
first type is Nintendo Switch. What do
you mean two months? These games take
advantage of the performance.
Scalpers, please let me have two. The
second type is compatible games that
were released on Nintendo Switch. Thank
god.
Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games are the
third type. Whoa.
Whoa. Some games that were released on
Switch will receive upgraded versions
that offer things like improved visuals,
unique ways to play on Switch 2, and
more.
Now, I'd like to show you the Jamberee
TV. Super Mario Party Jamberee.
Let's go. We're back. Call up Ray. It's
time bringing back the Mario Party.
We're getting updates. Mario Party
Jamberee is getting an upgrade on
Nintendo Switch 2.
The upgrade expands on the base game and
adds new features, including mouse
controls. God,
audio recognition. Oh no.
More expressive. The worst type of
games. The gimmicks and gameplay that
uses a camera accessory. Oh [ __ ] All of
which can be accessed on Switch too. Uh,
you know what? Maybe right. Maybe we
should hold back and updated modes.
First up is Mario Party mode with a
single camera up to get ready for all
the YouTubers to get doxed. You'll be
able to see each other's faces as you
play so you can experience all their
reactions and emotions in real time. I
wonder if there's a way you can do it
while not having the camera off.
Up next, it's Bowser Live. Jack Black
where the livelier team wins. This is
just Jack Black will bring you on stage
tape on the camera to collect the most
coins.
I mean the technology is crazy actually

Finally take a ride control carnival
coaster with the safety bar lowered and
secured.
You're off.
They brought back the flower. I love
that. Shoot down enemies while you feel
the bumps and rumbles of the coaster. I
love that. It It's kind of like the
actual Nintendo Nintendo World. When you
enter a pipe, a mini game will begin. I
love that. There's a bouldering game.
Two players each control an arm. I
actually love that. One where you shake
a can of spray paint and quickly tag
objects.
Enjoy the thrill of these intuitive mini
games. Dude, I have a headache from
yelling once you reach the station. From
mini games that use a camera, the
built-in mic, Donkey Kong, mouse
controls, and rumble, the biggest party
yet is getting even bigger. Super Mario

That's right. Plus you can get even more
out of your adventures in Hyrule using
Zelda notes.
This new feature can be accessed via the
Nintendo Switch app on smart devices.
Cool. It's a game specific service
that's exclusive to the Switch edition
titles. That's cute. For example, it can
help guide you to various locations like
shrines and you haven't found the map.
Guidance activating.
It's the Tavat map but for [ __ ] uh
Zelda. I like that. Okay, wait. That
actually looks a lot better. Or you can
share your creations using QR codes and
send them to another player to create in
their game. Huge. That's actually fire.
That's actually great.
[Music]
They really said [ __ ] Twitter. They
really did.
We hope these features will make your
adventures even more enjoyable. It's
crazy seeing this in
60. Forgotten Land. Great game. Whoa.

Land, you'll be able to enjoy an
additional story exclusive to the

bingo card as well, by the way. This
story takes place in the Forgotten Land.

Pokemon Legends ZA. Hold on. I have to
do it. I have to do it. I have to do it.
I have to do it. This was a mistake.
This was a mistake. This was a mistake.
Choose from these two modes, both of
which support actually is vastly
different and play style. That actually
is vastly different.
Plus, Pokemon Legends ZA, which is
scheduled to launch later this year,
will not only Wow, it actually runs like
a modern game, but a Nintendo Switch 2
edition. Chad, it looks good. By taking
advantage of the Switch, you can enjoy
your adventure in Lumio City with
enhanced resolution. Run like dick.
The Nintendo Switch 2 edition games you
just saw will be available as both here.
I'm going back saw will be available
physical and digital versions. I got it.

Switch version of a game, you can play
the Nintendo Switch 2 edition by
purchasing. Not all of them have upgrade
packs. Looking forward to these Nintendo
Switch 2 edition games. Interesting.
Next, I'd like to introduce a brand new
game featuring mouse controls with
Joycon 2 controllers. Please take a
look. God, we're so
behind. What is this?
for a second. What? Sorry, not what I
was
expecting. Wait, new
IP. I'll give you that. I really thought

I can still tell the quality difference.
It takes two. You're going to love this
one. Trust me. You get what I of course
you'll be able to play split fiction on
