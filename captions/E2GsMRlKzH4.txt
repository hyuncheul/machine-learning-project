that following stuff that I mentioned to
you guys just now, and one more thing I
do want to mention, if you guys do
notice any like buffering or any sort of
lag during the stream and especially um
how it affects the stream replay as
well, do bear with us. Honestly, I'm not
really I'm still not really not sure if
like if it's my internet or if it's like
the OBS update that's currently out
right now or whatever the case may be.
Whenever ends up happening, if there's a
disconnect or it's like if like the
stream buffers or lags or any drop
frames happen, do do your best to bear
with us. Honestly, this has been a this
has been a problem we've been dealing
with lately. And um I don't know if
it'll happen here, but well, I just want
to let you guys know ahead of time in
case any of that happens. just do stick
around with this cuz the uh the
disconnect only happens in like maybe
around like 15 to 20 seconds actually
like after 15 to 20 seconds then the
stream should come back up once again
just uh you know kind of let you guys
know actually if you're watching this
live it won't really affect the replay
but anyways without further ado I think
I rebbled enough here so let's go and
hop into the voice chat so we can
eventually go ahead and get started with
our gameplay stream and especially our
first ever Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade
pack hype stream uh officially right now
actually. So without further ado, let's
get into the voice chat in 3 2 1. Cooly

anyways, good to see you guys here once
again. And uh we're going to be doing a
different kind of stream actually
because basically what we're going to be
doing, we're going to be playing some
Switch One games. They're going to be
getting upgrade packs on the Nintendo
Switch 2, which is pretty much the games
we're going to be doing. We're going to
be showing up in Mario Party Jamberee.

longer than I expected. Uh very
unexpected as well. But we're all good
to go now. So, uh you know what we'll
do? Uh we're we're going to go back in
the morning party jamberee again. And uh
we're just going to we're going to go in
the morning party jamberee and we're
just going the same people that uh
already played before so we can finish
up the game we already we were just
doing.
So the only people that can join are
team uh team Sam, Sally, and Tails for
this one since they were in the last
one. So just we can try to finish off
that that one round we did before we got
interrupted and whatnot. S
Yeah, basically this be the uh the round
we just did. Uh, we're just going to try
to finish it up. Oh, should we?
Yeah. Yeah, that's what of course that's
what I just said there.
Okay. Let's do this.
All right. Oh, sorry. I'll play. I'll
just send I'll just send invites
actually. Whatever. I'll take the I got
23 seconds, but I need 20. All right. No
passcode. I'll take the uh the box. I
know you won except the people I don't
get to invite. Team Sam. Uh, Dean Sam,
Tails, and Sally. I'm only just going to
invite them for right now. So, my
question is, I I remember getting this
trick done. The the slide shortcut. All
right. What? Why you guys don't even

allowed on Mario Party at all? Not if
I'm noticing. Oh, sorry. I was just um

an invite.
All right, hold on.
Curse is spoiled again. Yeah, make sure
you guys uh make sure you guys pick the
same characters you guys were. So like
team Sam's Roselina, Tails is Toad, and
then S Luigi.
Yeah, I'm cuz I think I saw like uh if
you want to go back in a save file of a
game you already did, you got to play
the same character you already did about
the same people. Hey, Logan, have you
All right, so there's Sally. Send an
invite. Okay, there we
go. Sam, they see Tails and
Sally finish up the warm up. Oh, that is
another that was another close test.
Yeah, maybe I might do another one
possibly. I don't know. But um but yeah,
I'm coming. Okay, so I just want to let
you guys know what ended up happening
was I thought there was going to be a
storm in my area cuz like there's a
small chance of a storm in my area, but
it has been sunshine like this whole
entire time. Like it did not even hit us
at all. So that's why I thought it was I
thought I thought like I thought there
was one earlier but thankfully uh didn't
really get didn't really hit us at all.
So that's why I went AFK and all that
stuff but we are all good to go once
again. All right one we just did. I I
like how it saves your progress
automatically. Yeah, thankfully it does
that.

this. in front of you. Uh when it does
the double buttons, you have to
hit Hey, the main game is frustrating.
But you got to calm down.
Oh, here we go. What the How is How is
Sammy getting it right, but I'm getting
it wrong? Because you're like with the
LR, you're supposed to press at the same
time. Oh, there we go. Why when the when
it does the double?
Yeah. L L R
separately. Plus at the same time T's
has got an advantage cuz I hit circles
like bigger than

A princess having a monkey. This is a
princess having a monkey. How about a
princess and a monkey?
Princess and a monkey. Evil monkey. What
the?
Yeah. Yeah, they have they make us they
make a huge advantage for like the other
player like the player that who got the
gym playing the jimbery
buddy cuz mainly that one it's like
whoever gets it then their circle is a
lot bigger so it'll be a lot easier to
like time
it as you like uh when you're like
trying to press it well it's kind of
hard to explain you but you guys know
what I mean it's kind of difficult to
get a big like a bigger circle and they
can like time it perfectly. Yeah. Oh,
the tower turner. Timmy
Turner. No, that's the wrong thing.
Never mind.
Oh, he was like broadcasting my Star
Trek.
Oh, I thought it was going to come my
way for a dual me game. Yay.

shut the floor before I place it
down. You have to place it down anyway.
I mean, the show the circle is where you

Yeah, that one time. Yeah, that one
time. Uh,
we should do that again sometime. That
was fun. It was I'm not sure when we
might actually go back if we
ever switch. I'm kidding.
I think that might not be a bad idea. I
don't terrifying. I don't give a [ __ ]
why multiple times. No, no, you go away.
Yeah, I think I think Andrew, you were
the only one that got like the draw
upside down one. I think we're a bunch
of high schoolers just fighting in a
game. I've done that multiple times.
Legit. Yeah. Welcome to being a child. I
mean, a teenager. I got to fight them.
Oh, wait. Fight the batties.
Get back. Get back. Get back. Get back.
