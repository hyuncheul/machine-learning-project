Live start so the actual Nintendo switch

minutes give or take it'll start at 6:00
a.m. Pacific 9:00 a.m. eastern I can
barely afford my bills right can barely
afford our bills and then rent goes up
10% like nothing nothing goes up 10%
it's
ridiculous welcome on in everybody let's
see
put up this there we
go but let's see have I played uh I
think it's undertale I I played one
playthrough of it and I did a pacifist
run it was pretty fun it it was okay I'm
just not big into reading tons and tons
of text luckily have no bills yet oh man
enjoy the time before no
bills electric bills been crazy
[Music]
yeah respect Youtubers with the life
yeah so yeah I've got a
trying to think what else I do all kinds
of stuff most people don't realize so uh
yeah a father with three kids 12 12year
old uh 7-year-old and about to turn
5-year-old so that's always
fun um and then on top of that I'm also
in the Air Force Reserves I've got 17
and A2 years in the Air Force Reserves
17 and A2 years working on airplanes
fixing them up all that kind of stuff so
it's it's been a lot and then also uh
doing the YouTube and making
content all of that while being a
full-time accountant doing that as well
but
today we are hoping for the hollow night
silk song news I don't know what the
chances are of actually getting Hollow
night silk song I I don't think that
it's crazy high uh do you kids watch my
videos H not so much every once in a
while they might watch something but not
all the
time um
what else um I think that we're going to
get some really big first party games
obviously right like we we already saw
that there was the Mario Kart
9 which I heard that they might just
jump and call it Mario Kart 10 I don't
know hopefully they it's it should be
Mario Kart
9 but we'll see uh other than Mario Kart
um I think I think we do get at least an
announcement of
I I would imagine we see something Zelda
related uh if you guys haven't
downloaded the Nintendo switch 2 app
they already announced a Zelda
liveaction movie but that doesn't come
out to uh till 2026 so that'll be
interesting as far as the game's
actually more more announcements I think
there's a good chance that we see a uh a
Mario Odyssey game
right I imagine that we'll probably get
a new first party game kind of like how
they released or announced arms at the
original Nintendo
Direct but I don't
know I don't know 3D Mario that's
exactly what I'm saying I I think that
we could get a a 3D
Mario um type type thing I think that's
I'm trying to remember I I I don't
normally pay attention to all the Mario
games uh go the iOS route and call it
Mario Kart X yeah it it very well could
could go like that for for the Mario
Kart game it could jump up to uh Mario
Kart X and welcome welcome to this the
twitch
stream we're we're doing the multi
multistream thing but I can see all the
chat in one spot which is nice I want to
see silk song The Hornet wallpapers
manifesting I've had that Hornet
wallpaper for years and years so I don't
know how much manifesting is doing at
this point but you never
know let's see yeah if we don't get silk
song news oh no no no
don't talk like
that uh let's see the local Diner here
has a robotic thing that takes the trays
and food around and it plays old school
Mario music while it moves around oh
that's fun we went to uh my wife and I
went on a date uh a little while back
and it was to a Korean barbecue spot and
they had that they had the little robot
that would bring over like the things
that they would uh
refill um but it was also one of those
places where you got to cook and like on
a a Habachi type Grill I guess you would
call it where you they bring you the the
the meat that was like raw and then
you'd cook it yourself on the grill in
front of you and then as a grill got
like um kind of disgusting from grilling
too much on it or whatever they would
bring you out a new grill it was really
cool I I really like Korean barbecue if
you guys have never tried it it is
delicious you have to cook the food to
exactly like the way you want it
sha indeed welcome on in
everybody Sil song Shadow silk song will
not Shadow drop I don't believe
it I I think that we we still have a
chance for silk song
today my hopes are less High than they
were
for uh the earlier Nintendo switch 2
thing yo thank you so much for the
follow
twitch side of the house hello hello um
I think we have we have less of a chance
today
but I I know that there's a there's
Nintendo Treehouse live events coming
up and I I have even less of a belief
that it'll happen then because Nintendo
Treehouse lives are just very long there
one of them's 4 hours and the other
one's 3 hours over the next 2 days it is
it it's just going to be backto
back um just really long playthroughs of
games cuz in the past it was like a uh
what do you call it uh it was like Zelda
breath of the wild and they would play
like two or three hours of it like it
those tree hous those tree houses were
like really
long so I don't
know um with that said I don't silk song
is big enough to where they wouldn't
just announce it or do something in the
middle of a a treehouse live Nevada
Smiles it is good to see you welcome in
my
friend welcome
in and Nevada or Nevada natalian good
morning good morning I have not had
enough coffee for
this well good luck with your exams
Natalia I'm just glad that you're here
welcome welcome even if it's only for a
little bit when does it start we will be
starting in 20 minutes is when we we
like I'm part of the the show or
anything like that um the Nintendo
switch 2 direct starts in 20
minutes
so I don't think we need the sacrifice
Moss bag unfortunately I don't think
that that's going to do anything that
was the meme from like 3 years ago and
uh it didn't do anything so I don't
think we have to worry about moss bag oh
my gosh it isn't like 5:40 yes it is it
is 5:40 a.m. Pacific so I went to I
tried to go to bed at like 9:00 p.m.
last night and and ended up like hanging
out in bed until 10:00
so I guess that's better than going to
bed at 10:00 and then hanging out on
your phone till 11:00 you know that's uh
I'm sure I'm not the only one who does
that first Moss bag now we sacrificed
reia yeah I was yeah I was the Lesser
known one on that uh that raid where
they trying to sacrifice
people hope that switch to cost $400 so
what I saw from leaks is that it would
cost
$500 whether not those leaks are true is
a whole another question right I have I
have no idea like or were the leaks true
or not but uh I saw it from a a spawn
wave deal yo new subscriber
welcome see I wish
it doesn't say um yeah we'll turn off
all the alerts and all the music and all
that kind of stuff once the uh once the
direct starts in a little more than 15
minutes let's see is it going to be on
the PS5 uh the Nintendo switch 2 direct
will not be on the PS5 I know that's not
the question you were asking though uh
Hollow night silk song will be on the
PS5 for sure all right Natalia thank you

bit good luck with the exams or even
getting ready on for the

appreciate you being here when the event
begin uh now right at 15 minutes you're
on the vertical yo there we go we got
the vertical we got the wide we're
multistreaming we got the twitch we're
all over the place right
now welcome in everybody what uh so what
are what are the big game predictions
that you all have that's what I want to
hear chat so mine like I said mine were
obviously Mario Kart we already know
that that's going to be a thing we got
stizzle showing up in chat that's a
that's a big
deal Zelda I think we're going to get
something Zelda related I think that
that would be cool Mario Odyssey I think
would be a good one I I think that if we
don't get Arms
2 we get some other new IP that like
we've never seen before so obviously
there's no way to like even guess what
that would be but a brand new IP that
we've never seen
[Laughter]
before silk song is is is a hope and a
prayer but that's about
it uh the shortest shirt how long will
the direct go on for it's rumored to be
an hour or no Nintendo Nintendo
confirmed that one Nintendo confirmed
that it would be an hour um so it's
going to yeah there you go my prediction
sha game
miles
Zoo there we go I can never pronounce I
can never pronounce all all all of your
names all your names are so crazy it's
impossible for me to figure it out
remastered Zelda
game re yeah I wonder if there's going
to be remasters I feel like remasters
would have been announced earlier unless
it's like aquarina of time something
like that Collective
[Music]
hallucination do some
Bingo uh I
[Music]
don't if I had like paper and stuff
right here maybe I'd do a bingo card
real quick
but Goose of war is easy enough that's
right new Donkey Kong would be cool or
or something from uh monolith
software what does monolith software
do no matter what happens it will be a
direct for the age is fizzle you are
right new Donkey Kong would be cool
I really do you think we'll get silk
song I I do I think that there's I think
there's a chance do I am I like certain
like today's the day so song comes out
no
no um I also we also got to talk like
release date um I think that there's
there's a a solid 50/50 chance that the
Nintendo switch 2 we get a what do you
call it
um the there's a good chance that today
is the day that we can pre-order the
Nintendo switch 2 I think that that
could happen cuz there were there I
guess there's one retailer that put up
something about that I think it might
have been Best Buy and then it got taken
down right
away so pre just be ready it might be
today for
[Music]
pre-orders hey Chris from Portland
welcome thank you for the new sub I
appreciate it if not not today
pre-orders might be next week and I know
a lot of people are saying oh Nintendo
switch 2 it could it could be released
May 15th I don't think it's originally I
thought that that could be the case but
if you check out the Nintendo uh d uh
app the new one there are Nintendo
events that are happening all through
all the way through the end of May
there's a Hong Kong uh Nintendo switch
to experience it's happening like mid
May and then there's a twoe break I
think that's on like the 15th or
something like that and then May 31st
there's a soul South Korea uh switch to
experience so it's like there's there's
these experiences that are happening and
I don't think that they're going to
release the game and then have the
experience after the game's released
that doesn't I I I just don't see that
happening how long until it starts we it
starts in 10 minutes we are getting very
close uh I have four live open of
different people to see the reactions
there you go there you go firecracker
who who are the four people is primon on
there too got to take my copium that's
right maybe real silk song was in our
hearts all along do you think silk song
will come full circle with the Treehouse
events no I don't think so the Treehouse
events are too long um
when when Hollow night silk song was on
The Treehouse they were showing a demo
and it was a longer deal
um
and it
wasn't as hyped up as it is now I think
that it's a prime time
thing I would be EXT I the The Treehouse
live doesn't get nearly as many eyeballs
on it because the first one is I I
forget which one which one of them is 4
hours the other one's three hours hello
TS welcome in will we see Elden ring
night rain on this thing ooh I think
that there's a chance that we get Elden
ring night rain to to release on the
Nintendo switch 2 but it might not
be like on uh on release
day
goodbye was it have a good day call the
shade Lord to the radiance let's see
when does the direct start 10 minutes we
go live with a Nintendo Direct
2 in just under 10 minutes you're 100%
doubter you what honestly it you've got
a better chance the the doubter camp has
a has a better chance like
I we we don't
have we're not like certain that Silk
song's coming out but you never know oh
we get uh flashback cut sings to hollow
night to hollow and silk song that would
be
interesting we still don't know if it's
uh new sub hype uh if it's a prequel or
a sequel you know who don't even know
that I'm coming after all the doubters
I'm under your
[Music]
bed Skittle has to go to school dude
that's what I'm saying it's kind of a
kind of a rough time if you're like if
your core audience is like young
Gamers I'm I'm I'm a little old to be a
young
gamer I I just turned 37 ooh o big
number I don't talk about that much but
there you go it's uh it's it's really
early if silk song releases will you be
the uh the first speedrunner I would not
be the first speedrunner I'm not super
fast I'm I know I'm not
great cloaking I'm too old was is most
forgettable boss in the game what do you
think forgettable uh Elder who maybe I
don't
know that's the first one that comes to
mind which means that maybe it's not
forgettable you are great reia ah Hollow
Lord you're too
kind L is 30 yeah see we we got the we
we got the the the older crowd here the
30 and up crowd let's go raise up raise
up lifetime Gamers let's
go can you open Don't Starve music
together no I can't all of the all of
the music that I'm playing right now is
all music that I hired a producer to
make and so it's all uh on the up and up
for copyright
stuff I paid for a
license to be able to uh to get the
music
going be cool if we got a cut scene for
holl night escapes back to the black egg
Temple see that's what I'm talking about
we need answers I don't think that
they're going to make clear-cut answers
in so song like I we're going to have to
piece it together just like we piece
together Hollow
night I think silk on getting a release
trailer uh the day after April fools
would be hilarious copium is strong
right I mean it'd be more funny if they
released it
on April fools but you
know older by one year hey you know what
that's you're still way older than me
whole year geez I'm just kidding
gaming since 87 old AF yeah I was
uh I wasn't gaming quite yet at 87 but
pretty close I was I was right behind
you by a couple
years hey Blues says a really been
watching your video since
2021 and they really helped me getting
11 12% of my first play through and
working on P5 bindings right now keep up
the good work yo P5 bindings was easily
the hard hardest thing that I ever did
in Hollow night I mean I did all the
bindings one at a time but that was
difficult to say the
least imagine real release trailer the
day after April fools
right I turn 22 in two days oh hell
no my
see the day that Silk song comes out is
the day I won't see uh sunlight for 4
days that's exactly it my wife lady
relia knows that once silk song comes
out and I'm going to be gone for a while
relia who won the Lenovo good
question it was I had a feeling that
that might come
up uh tornado plays
13261 I put up the instructions for them
in the comment let me hit refresh see if
they replied yet because Lenova leg and
AMD uh I they have not replied yet so
they got seven days to reply and then I
also put in the pinned uh comment on
there uh a video of me doing the drawing
so it's all on the up and up you can see
it was random and all that kind of good
stuff think the most forgettable boss is
God Tamer no one talks about it yeah
that's true that one was kind of uh not
everyone
did that whole thing
so that would make sense hello from
Indonesia yo welcome in it is good to

shoot that doesn't look the best eat
okay I got in I got in oh no no
[Music]
no yeah it's like it's like a Nintendo
Discord you can chat to your heart's
content even while playing different
games that's kind of cool yeah I know
that one it's so hard right I'm get rid
the alerts oh wow I'm like in the sky
right here I'm a I fell I'm falling I'm
falling I'm falling okay we got it we're
safe we're safe Kirby look you're at a
star that's so cute so
cute you can adjust the size of your
game
screen guys I'm lost like where did you
go or expand another friend's game
screen I mean it's cool but it it looks
kind of laggy it's just like the wall
like if she gets past the
wall a little wall
ride so everyone can watch them play I
don't know I don't know how I feel about
it okay I think we
have it is a it is a cool feature let's
take a picture here are you ready
smile I don't I don't know I wonder if
people use it a bunch on the right Jo I
do like to you're able to talk to each
other button with the c button you can
pull up a chat
menu oh D really wa actually guys uh I
got a call coming right now so uh I'll
be right back yeah okay
sure here you can quickly and easily
mute yourself and more okay there's
Nintendo switch to camera no by
connecting this camera to the
system hey it'll green screen yourself
in you look just like me
H yo the direct two is expected to be
how's everyone doing good you can appear
on screen and video chat while playing a
game wait Nick how was your test
yesterday it was
good here's how it looks with just the
camera
feed see I think having just a camera
feed would make more sense I like that
you can do that look forward to games
use your camera feed like
this
no that's kind of cool for playing with
friends and actually being able to
connect a little bit more I like that
using
Game even when you're aart you can play
games and hang out as if you were
together in the same room play together
or compete in online multiplayer games
the downside is that you need a separate
camera like I'm surprised that the
camera is not built into the switch
to decide your own rules for a retro
game
competition or hold a sports competition
between
families that look like a new game all
together anytime
anywhere game
chat what did you think in developing
game chat they're talking about it like
it's not just a basic video call that
everyone knows others more closely
including family and friends almost as
if you're all playing together in the
same
place it's new for Nintendo Nintendo
likes to take things that are old and
make is the nintend Swit 2
camera which will be available on the
same day as switch
2 nintend swi online membership will be
required to use game
chat however since we'd like as many
people as possible to experience game
chat we let you do family without a
membership for a limited time oh okay we
hope you'll try it out oh okay ends
March 31st 2026 I thought it was 2025
for second nintend Swit parental control
wait a minute that already passed can be
adjusted for example whether parental
permission is always required when a
child wants to use game chat to play
with their friends Ah that's smart that
was one thing I was thinking about as as
a parent to introduce video experience
you can share with family and friends I
don't know why the audio is out of sync
the audio went out on the live stream
for a nendo switch even if you just have
one game you can pass a joy-con
controller to a friend and play together
but on Nintendo switch 2 you can play
together locally on multiple systems
using just one game with game share
as shown here even games that require
multiple screens can be played if one
person
own with game share you can temporarily
share compatible games with others who
also have Nintendo switch 2 or a
Nintendo switch system you can share a
game with up to three other systems at a
time game share also supports online
play with other switch 2 systems and you
can use it with friends via game chat
which we showed
earlier game share can only be used with
compatible games this feature is planned
for several titles starting with a free
update for Clubhouse games 51 worldwide
Classics on Nintendo
switch game share support is also
planned for select games exclusive to
Nintendo switch 2 so we hope you'll look
forward to it you think that they just
put it on like everything okay what's
next effect added we like to show you
the nintend Swit system
itself please take a look
I'm going to at 7.9
in a bigger buil-in screen here's how
that compares to Nintendo switch ooh the
system's thickness Remains the Same
interesting the
same with approximately double the
pixels compared to switch you can enjoy
games in Greater detail on the 1080p
screen okay well I think everyone is
expecting 1080p that that that's fine
1080p is normal
120 the screen supports up to 120 frames
per second allowing for smoother
gameplay in supported
titles see that's that's what Nintendo
switch needed to was their 30 sometimes
FPS screen is more Vivid and supports
HDR providing more contrast between
light and dark areas of the images
okay the allnew joy-con 2 controllers
connect magnetically tell me they fix
magnets keep the controllers firmly
attached to the system detach your
controller easily by pressing the
release button on the back no silk Tong
announcement
yet we're just getting started though
the SL and Sr buttons are bigger for
greater comfort and control when playing
with a joyon 2 held horizontally needed
that for
sure the left and right sticks are now
larger big that's too
big mouse controls everyone everyone
thought each joyon 2 controller can be
used as a mouse play with compatible
games both the left and right joyon 2
support Mouse
controls tell me you fixed the stick
drift by adjusting audio balance between
the ranges sounds from the built-in
speakers are clearer and more natural in
handheld and tabletop modes
okay it has a built-in microphone so you
can voice chat with friends anytime via
game chat that it also uses noise
cancelling technology to filter sounds
so your voice will come through clearly
that's pretty common these days all
right you don't have a surround sound
system games can be enjoyed with more
immersive three-dimensional sound as if
it were coming from all around
you it's like it's everywhere in my head
chat whoa
place your Nintendo switch 2 however you
like with a large sturdy stand I like
how they don't acknowledge that like hey
this is so much better than before
they're just like this is what it is now
in addition to the USBC Port found on
the bottom of the system there's one on
top as well oh that's
nice it's handy for connecting a USBC
camera or charging in tabletop mode
make sure never to lose
this Nintendo switch 2 comes with 256 GB
of internal storage eight times that of
Nintendo switch storing your game
download the games are going to be eight
times bigger as well too right reading
and writing data is also
faster use the Nintendo switch 2 dock to
connect to your TV and enable up 4K
resolution for compatible games yo 4K HR
is also supported in TV
mode
okay the Nintendo swi put fan that keeps
your system cool this helps keep
performance
stable smart they needed
that on Nintendo switch 2 you can play
Nintendo switch 2 games as well as
compatible Nintendo switch games
physical and digital games are
supported release date release
date as you just saw Nintendo switch 2
isn't simply an improved Nintendo is
for we redesigned the system from the
ground up and packed in lots of new
gameplay
features and to help players better
understand the switch to Hardware we're
currently developing why would they fix
the drift right Mr
kaoto hello my current location is
actually inside the game itself no way
in the game this is Nintendo switch 2
Welcome tour exclusive to Nintendo
switch 2
okay I'm standing over here I guess
that's kind of what one two switch was
okay everyone join me inside the
game there are a lot of question mark
icons here let's examine
them this sign reads where are the
magnets it's a game that you can play
that tells you controllers attached to
the system with magnets and those
magnets are inside the
system is that a real game the SL and Sr
buttons on the joint joyon 2 are made of
metal so that's how they attach to the
system a magnetic circuit is formed
between them so they won't easily
detach through examining signs like
these you can discover all sorts of
secrets about Nintendo switch 2 another
example the joycon 2 controllers have
Mouse controls and when combined with
the gyroscopes you can even do something
like this
you can adjust the position of the golf
club and aim for the Cup by rotating the
joy-con
[Music]
2 by combining the mouse controls and
gyroscopes things like this are
possible there are secrets to discover
even as you're playing mini games and
Tech
demos some of the secrets range from the
unique features of the system to Tiny
details you might not notice until
they're pointed out there are plenty
there are
plenty Nintendo switch 2 welcome tour

interested now I'd like to share some
more information regarding Nintendo

safety bar lowered and
secured you're off

enemies while you feel the bumps and
rumbles of the coaster interesting

players each control an arm and one
where you shake a can of spray paint and
quickly tag
objects enjoy the thrill of these
intuitive mini games how quickly can you
reach the
station from Min games that use a camera

uh if I get switch too can I play my
switch games on it yes all my games are
downloads I only have physical copy of
hollow night I think that you'll be able
to play a lot of your games from switch
on switch to I think my life that's a
good question cuz they're selling
upgrade versions for like Zelda breath
of the wild and stuff so I don't
know dude it was new footage all right
we'll go back and check it out I don't
think that was new footage though it
looked like old
footage I mean it was just jumping in
the the bone bottom
area how do you get a physical copy of
hollow night they sell physical copies
um as part of a collector's edition
silk song is definitely not exclusive to
the
switch it it's releasing all platforms
at
launch it's going to be on the Xbox game
pass on release and PlayStation Plus on
release as
well woo if you blinked you would have
missed silk song like it was it was so
fast

all that matters we
got we got mention of silk

it's probably from something else I just
don't know I just can't put my finger on
it as far as what it
is dusk
Bloods interesting it is a new
IP did they announce something about
silk song kind of well they said 2025 so

this so it's going to be a Nintendo
something rather
Kirby Mario uh
Mario what are we looking

it a new Kirby 3D
Adventure Kirby you got to wish harder

it whoa rocket boosters in your
star that's
speed that's fast
boy that's what time stamp with silk
song is when they were showing all the
the little

night so song and it said that it's
releasing in
2025 a shos 20125 all right
Nintendo
game it's getting a brand new game I
hope you're looking forward to Kirby Air
Riders all

last trailer for the day why would we
play anything other than Mario Kart 9
for racing
games sacar a goat right what is
this it's not Pikman
It looks
interesting lot of lot of crystals
things moving around that kind of look
like animals but aren't animals Ingot
aisle
monkey Donkey
Kong
no no it won't be a Donkey Kong
game I was wrong it is a Donkey Kong
game let's go
oh he he's got his new the new version
of Donkey Kong his eyes are different
they're more
cartoony I wish they didn't change that
they they changed it to make them try to
be have more
Expressions because his old eyebrows
made him look angry all the
time that's
[Music]
interesting Donkey Kong can just like
destroy the world
Donkey Kong minor
Edition I don't know if I like the sound
of
that he's also got a new voice way he's
like he he's voiced by Chris Pratt I
think smash
Edition I'm not a big fan of the new
face I I get the ideas for more
Expressions
but ooh banana so they're trying to do
like a 3D Mario version for Donkey Kong
which I don't think they've done since
uh Super Mario or sorry Donkey Kong
64 it's got potential I'm just hung up
on the way his face looks cuz it's like
not my Donkey Kong that's not what I
grew up
with silk song is going to release 20125
that was announced
today I have to do the math uh July
okay that's a brand new 3D platforming
action game starring Donkey Kong called
Donkey Kong
bonanza with Incredible strength smash
through enemies walls the ground round
and just about everything else is you
demolish your way through a massive
underground World more details will be

as the bundle that includes a digital
version of Mario Kart World Mario Kart
World looks like it's actually going to
be really
fun was there anything about silk song
silk song will release in 2025 that's
what we got covered a lot of information
you have to wait just a bit longer for
launch June 5th isn't bad I knew it
wasn't going to release in May that was
my prediction and I got it right
don't worry I will we'll go back to find
the silk song information right
now okay so I think silk song happened
it was after
denture uh
wait yeah was when they
were oh yeah I missed the Cyber Punk
thing cuz that's when everything wasn't
working
okay here we go get
ready nint if you blink you're going to
miss it we're going to look at the
hollow night silk song news that we got
it's coming up like
next coming up real
quick do slow motion we'll do slow
motion we'll we'll do it once through
normal and then we'll do slow motion how
about that
already passed it oh my bad did I
really all right you're right I passed
it it goes by so
fast was that is that
it you can transport yourself to the
City of Dreams at home tell me was it
cyber Punk or was it before ready to
meet Unforgettable characters and
discover engaging stories go
back Ultimate Edition comes to nintend
it was before cyber Punk thank
you I could have swore it was
after come
on I thought it was after we yeah it was
after I could have swore wasn't it after
the recap during the Showcase
after cyber Punk
okay engaging stories when cyber
punk7 is in the game compilation okay
let's just be patient we'll get to the
game compilation and then we'll just
watch through it here we go here's a
game
compilation we're just going to
relax I want it full screen though
there it is CH song oh that is
new watch it again yo so
song okay now let's go a little slower
by a little slower I mean frame by frame
because I'm like so excited okay so
first is do we miss anything let's go to
the beginning
okay chat we've got hollow night silk
song frame by frame breakdown at the
Nintendo switch to direct so obviously
we're at the very beginning of the
game and we got Hornet and she's jumping
she's grappling on to a ledge like we
have seen before with a little oh going
too fast with a little run and a jump oh
my God gosh oh there's an enemy
oh which is one we've seen before near
the the uh not the massive Moss charger
Moss mother is that what we're calling
it I want to see the new stuff there we
go so
here looking up at the top the the top
left so we've got the we've got the new
weapon or or whatever her load out is
but buch of mass okay the yellow thing I
think we've seen that before but the
second symbol that kind of if I had to
guess that looks like some sort of
grappling hook we have not seen that
before I'm pretty
sure I love this area that looks like
snow but it's probably some sort of like
fungus
growth that looks cool I really like
it ah Hollow night silk song 2025 let's
go oh hey don't be looking up there wait
is she it I wasn't sure if she had extra
legs under the dress nope I thought I
saw one thing where she was like doing
this like going backwards thing and she
popped out extra legs I was just
checking for scientific purposes don't
don't worry about it all right so new
area again looks like fungus or
something new enemies we haven't seen
this before and let's see so we've got
the spike traps up at the left we've
seen that
before it's interesting that her ability
to do the uh uh what are they the gossan
string or what whatever it's called it's
actually on
here normally in the past in the old
trailers it didn't show that before so
that was
new silk song may be in the treehouse oh
my gosh you're right now it may be in
the
treehouse so Hornet jumping yep yep and
then she does her ability so it takes up
was that one two
four notches of uh
string and if you look at the top right
oh so it
uses it uses four notches of string and
it uses whatever the special stuff is
around her
uh around her UI I I I don't know
whatever that weapon is uses all of that
at the same time which is
weird um and it does not use up that
white bubble that is below her
masks so it's almost like she's got two
separate things that need to be filled
up she's got to fill up the the spool at
the bottom as well as the thing at the
top left but I think that the top left
thing is just if it's all the way full
when I say all the way full I mean to
that that first
Notch see when it's when it's full see
how it's glowing at the top left and
that Notch is like it it's all the way
to the
notch I'm wondering if that just lets
you know you've got at least one because
it looks like a spool from the top down
that's what I'm looking
at what time was it on see it we're
looking at something that's live so it
says minus 22 minutes 1422 so whatever
that comes out to be all right so oh
nope go back all right let's see so I
think that when you aren't at a full
thing I think it's either all the way on
or all the way off I think that that's
what's going on with this
attack all right and then it takes out
these enemies is there anything else we
see nope and then that's
it wait there's a direct right now the
direct just
ended the direct just
ended analyze the background yeah we can
take a look at the background
I feel like this isn't anything anything
new here I mean this I I I'm pretty sure
we've even seen this exact
spot this looks cool but it looks
underground and it looks like it looks
like it's at least connected to an area
that we've seen
before especially with the uh stag
tights coming from the ceiling I think
tights come from the ceiling I always
forget
but it's hard to say there's really not
too much that it's giving us with uh
with the blurry
background but there are these pillars
and I want to say that we've seen a
background like this
before I just I I'd have to look at some
of the other
trailers there's a little more trailer
footage later is there really
where this looks cool I feel like uh
this right here was a weapon and then
with all of these in the background
these look like uh
like a like some sort of almost like a
throne room or something like that like
this is where a lot of people would be
almost like oh man what am I thinking of
nightmare King Grim style where you've
got a bunch of people sitting there to
like judge you right um like almost like
Parliament or or something like that
where you've got a bunch of bugs are all
there to listen to whoever the speaker
is in the
middle that's kind of what I'm
thinking it looks like court or
something right I don't know exactly
what's going on in the middle cuz that
looks like something where you would put
obviously something very very important
but I'm not exactly sure what that would
be and then and then you just got a
chandelier up at the top but the
Chandelier looks like they're filled
with like those same uh almost like
white bird things the bugs that you see
in towns and stuff but instead of there
being like one or two in a little glass
ball now we've got a lot of them up in
this chandelier so I'm thinking what
whatever this is yeah the Luma FES um
but there's a lot of them so I'm
thinking that there's just that this is
a very important area what whatever it
is
so yeah the auditorium is the name right
there there you go it looks like an
auditorium spikes on the ground but
these spikes on the ground were from
Hornet it looks like it looks like she
threw those and put those on the ground
for the enemy but good
call wait is it so over well we know
that it's
2025 is that my Reddit post no we're
we're looking at the Nintendo Direct
right
now it's more than we ever had so far so
at least we know it's this year
right watching where to get white Palace
yeah let's see chat I'm tripping or did
they add a new picture on the steam page
let me uh let me go check that out
steam
store let's go find IL
song let me turn the volume down on that
sorry uh first let's look
through
these screenshot two screenshot three
four five six no all all that's from
before nothing nothing new there
is it clipped somewhere uh I haven't
clipped it or done anything with it yet
it's it's somewhere in the live
stream so I'm trying to see if we see
that white area somewhere in this
original trailer I I have a feeling we
might not see something exactly like it
I mean nothing exactly like it but just
the same like
background if you haven't seen this I
heard one Theory oh no
that this area right here
ah this area right here look at this see
how it's got these little like uh
notches and it spins this is like the
inside of a giant music box almost
certainly I forget where I heard that uh
that theory but I mean that is has to be
true already announced for 2025 yep uh
what about the XBox trailer from a few
years ago yep we can check that
too so silk song they're definitely
making some sort of song some sort of
music for something right now I'm just
looking through the background to see if
we see that the new area that we just
saw today is there something in
there that is similar to what we've seen
before no so happy for you really ah sh
thanks
George me years have been waiting for
this way too long waiting way too long
for this and I'm very excited I'm glad
we got something I feel like I can
[Music]
breathe New Towns Barnacles in the
background of the last
one big open cave
area it switched to a launch bu for you
yeah for me as a content creator 100%
yeah I'm debating like do I do a
giveaway for the switch to that's
something I'm thinking about doing
did we get a new trailer we did not get
a whole new trailer we got a 2C clip and
it said Hollow night silk song
2025 I don't see anything that looks
like the area that they that we just
saw so this is the area from the
Nintendo switch 2 direct uh this area
looks like something we've seen before
right here this is the the new new
area with the spikes and the background
and
everything so song's coming out on other
consoles too yes it's coming up uh it
they've already announced it's going to
be an Xbox uh Game Pass day one uh and
it's going to be on PlayStation game
pass it's it's everywhere day one it's
everywhere day one looks like land of
storms little bit the land of storms
didn't really have much of a background
I mean it did have a background but I
mean it didn't have these pillars in the
background that I
remember
so anyways that's all very very exciting
silk song 2025 we're getting it it's
happening oh what day is day one uh we
don't know when day one is we know day
one is in 20125 we just don't know
when welcome on in to the twitch side of
the chat hello hello good to see
you uh let's
see they showed silk song I can't
believe it
right uh make a prediction prediction
for silk song I still think silk song is
coming in
June I uh because June 5th is the
Nintendo switch to release date so I
think that we will get a definitive
release date in June at the Xbox
showcase Summer Games Fest Xbox event we
will get a a release
date um so I don't think it's going to
be a day one release on Nintendo switch
2
um
yeah win in the directives is shown
about 45 minutes in right after uh right
after cyberp
Punk take a look at the XBox trailer
okay let me uh let me pull it
up all right XBox
trailer so this is the second trailer
that came out not the initial release
date trailer
where do I see the trailer I'm just
looking on YouTube there wasn't a new
trailer released
today how much do I think it'll
cost $15 to $20 I don't expect it to be
much it's not going to be the price of a
full full game I don't
think so that looks cool I like that
area but I don't think that that's what
we saw today
that also look cool but not quite the
same
area th
that come on we're almost there go back
just a little
bit come on killing me this looks like
it's very close to the other the
auditorium area that we just saw
that looks like the last one looked like
the great morer area yeah it's maybe
here these this pillar looks similar to
the other one but the plant life looks
different and these are different
flowers yeah I think it's different I
think it's a brand new area that we
haven't seen before which is kind of
cool I like that they gave us something
just a tiniest little taste we as a
community needed
something and a a
2025 uh confirmation is really big I'm
excited for
that will I be playing Del lenter that's
just it's not my style of game I don't
know there's something about it probably
not but that's okay uh there's more
footage at the end of the Nintendo
Direct Montage was there really all
right let's see
it I don't think I didn't think that
there was
but okay we got Donkey
Kong yeah there there's nothing else
what what are you talking
about and just says it it's
over like what what do you mean at the
end of the Nintendo Direct Mon oh are
you guys just saying that's that's where

Punk right here so it's at minus 14
minutes from the
end an hour 20 minutes there you go I
just arrived is silk song there there
you go there you go there's silk Song

2025 I think that's news I think that's
important I like it I'm happy with what
we got

not happening anytime soon we did get a
little bit of Zelda news but it came in

we do have Nintendo switch to tree
houses over the next two days so just be
on the lookout for that there you go
