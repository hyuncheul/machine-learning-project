Nobody saw it coming. No one knew how
the disaster began. Till the zombie
hordes hit. Cities fell. Civilization
collapsed in the blink of an eye.
Survivors fled, seeking refuge in the
forgotten corners. Some clung to life
above the clouds. Others purled into
lightless bunkers. Most were lost
beneath the ashes. And yet some are
still fighting to survive.
Move faster. The woods are infested with
zombies.
Hurry. Use a torch to light the
campfire. Those things are closing in.
Good thing zombies fear light. Stay by
daybreak. They'll retreat into the
woods. We need to light up the
surroundings with the fire. Come on
people, we got lots to
[Music]
do. We reached the camp just as the
torch faded. When the campfire lit up, I
knew we had another day to live. Light
truly brings hope.
[Music]
Now we can see a bit further. After
running around all night, everyone's
starving. Let's see if we can Looks like
there's an abandoned kitchen here. Hope
to find something useful.
I hope there's something to eat.
Need a hand? Nah, just take a seat.
It'll be ready in no time.
I'm starving.
Food's
ready. Finally, I'm vanished.
What's that smell?

go hungry with me here. I'll go to the
woods and see if I can catch some prey.

long. Let's fix it up first. See if we
can find some hunting

You guys okay? David. David. He No.
Wait. It's dangerous.
No. Sorry. He's no longer your buddy.
without you. Let's help him find peace.
He wouldn't want to end up like
this. Guys, there might still be danger
around. We got to survive tonight
first. David's gone forever. Where is
the damn hope? How are we supposed to
survive this? By dawn, we laid David to
rest with deep sorrow.
It's my fault for not stopping David
from going hunting. He's getting
old. I still can't. Chin up, folks. We
got to prepare for another night.
Someone needs to take David's place.
Here, we can view the shelter residenc's
situation and make proper arrangements.
Now send someone to take David's place.
Oh boy, it's getting more wood. Don't
let the wind blow out the fire. Our
lives depend on
[Music]
it. Hundreds of zombies poured in.
My wife, Selia, I promised I'd keep
going, and I
will. Bad news, folks. We spotted a
horde of zombies on our way. A horde of
them? With this tiny flame, no one's
going to survive today. I've got the
blueprint. Didn't get a chance to use it
in the lab. Hustle up, guys. We got to
build the watchtowwer before nightfall.

him. Wipe those tears and get ready.
Zombies are coming.
