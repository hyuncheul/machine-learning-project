each other that's kind of nice actually
Pikmin Donkey Kong Country you can

that's kind of oh I was looking a little
chunky for a second there though
wall to your left you're almost there
though it's just like the wall like if
she gets past the wall this is where I
have to do a little wall
ride this could definitely be cool
though everyone can watch them play like
I don't necessarily know if this is a
feature that I will use
regularly but it is genuinely very cool
o okay oh nice let's take a picture here
I'm so curious though how the voice is
going to pick up if you're like blending
something in the background on the right
joyon 2 controller there's an additional
button uh-huh with the c button you can
pull up a chat
menu oh dang really oh actually guys uh

nice you can mute your mic mute yourself

what by connecting this camera to the

bro hey what's up what in the world
y this feels like some out of 3DS every
good and it's all like green screen out
and video while playing a game what you
got the little camera faing at you
bro here's how it looks with just the
camera
behind can you wait for me please look
new Mario use your camera feed like wait
a minute wait a minute that's a new
Mario Party is that jamb oh no that's
jamine never mind that's
I'm tripping I'm tripping I'm tripping
that was J that was J that was jere that
was
jere that was jamb using Game CH even
when you're aart you can play games and
hang out as if you were together in the
same room play together this would have
been good back
in0 brother did not play jamere I love
jamere I talked about how it was one of
my favorite games earlier in the Stream
I love it I just didn't recognize my
brain's not working I've been live for 6
hours Retro Game competition this is so
interesting
the sports competition between
families together it's also interesting
that they're focusing on this that it's
all like switch one stuff game they were
showing all switch one games and they
were showing Mario Kart what did you
think so they didn't want to spoil
anything in developing game chat our
goal was for you to enjoy playing online
with others more closely including
family and friends the camera thing is
almost if they're all playing together
in the same place I don't even know like
if that's an additional thing or if it
just comes with it the camera you saw in
the trailer is the Nintendo switch 2
camera uhuh which will be available on
the same same day but I don't think it's
packed in I don't think it's packed in
yeah that's true it'll be a little bit
like Mario Kart Arc onl MERS will be
required to that's fine we know that's
going to happen anyway that's fine you
needed to play online that's fine since
we'd like as many people as possible to
experience game chat it will be
available without a membership for a
limited time oh so this is kind of going
to be try it
out oh I read that for game chat
supports the Nintendo switch parental
controls app and different settings can
be adjusted for example whether parental
permission is always required when a
child wants to use game
chat that's pretty good that it lasts
next year new experience you can share
with family and friends
okay on Nintendo switch even if you just
have one game you can pass a joy-con
controller to a friend and play together
right but on Nintendo switch 2 you can
play together locally on multiple
systems using just one game that's nice
I like that with game share that's cool
shown here I like a that require
multiple screens can be played if one
person I love that this old games game
share you can tempor adding features to
also have Nintendo switch to or a
Nintendo switch system I thought share
game
with it works with the switch lights
game share also supports online play
with other switch 2 systems and you can
use it with friends via game chat which
we showed earlier oh yeah look game
share can only be used with compatible
games
ised starting with a free update academ
clh
games
Fury game share support is also planned
for select games of Nintendo they
wouldn't do this and then not have it
for switch 2 stuff up
next we'd like to show you the Nintendo
switch 2 system itself okay good show us
the UI take
look make it look nice bigger screen
same thickness let's go at 7.9 dude look
at switch has a bigger built-in screen
here's how that compares to Nintendo
switch the system's thickness Remains
the Same
[Music]
cool with approximately double the
pixels compared to switch you can enjoy
games in Greater detail on the 1080p
screen okay
okay what is it output
in a dock what's an output 120 FPS the
screen supports up to 120 frames per
second for smoother gameplay and
supported titles what the heck are you
even playing in 120 FPS I don't think
I've ever played a game in 120
FPS Vivid LCD HDR screen is more
Vivid
HDR light and dark areas of the
images the allnew joycon 2 controllers
connect magnetically awesome we knew
this magnets keep the controll I love
that you can't yank them out you have to
hold the button down detach your
controll easily by pressing the no
accidentally sliding it out nice nice
nice nice
nice good that's also good I hated the
little buttons on the old Joy comfort
and control when playing with a joy I'm
so happy how much of this is backwards
compatible all the switch one stuff
having in those features the left and
right sticks are now larger nice
bro yes yes yes yes each joy-con 2
controller can be used as a mouse to
play with compatible games both the left
and right joyon 2 support Mouse controls
double mice we're double mousing this
thing up by adjusting the audio balance
between the ranges sounds from the
built-in speakers are clearer and more
natural in handheld and TSE
man it has a built-in microphone voice
voice
head via game so interesting that it
negates the noise also uses noise caning
technology to filter sounds so your
voice I got to test clearly I got to
test
that I'm sure there's going to be a way
that we can test that if the experience
don't have a surround sound system games
can be enjoyed with more immersive
three-dimensional sound as if it were
coming from all around
you you're in the
rain playe OverWatch is going to be op
on switch 2 at Double mice bro when you
get Marvel Rivals double moused up it's
over bro look at the Nintendo switch 2
however you like look at the character
sturdy stand you can move it freely like
this I love the new kick stand that's
great two USB ports great good good in
addition to the
usbf bottom of the system there's one on
top as well nice charging from the top
is going to be super helpful it's handy
I can't get over the camera I never in a
million years would have expected the
camera thing in this never charging in
tabletop
mode nice to be fair that's how I play a
lot of the time I lay in bed and I have
a little charger back there Nintendo
switch 2 comes with 256 GB of internal
storage eight times that of Nintendo s
your game downloads save data and more
good stuff 2 writing data is also faster
good cuz you could obviously still add
more too but that's great good good good
use the Nintendo switch 2 DOC to connect
to your TV and enable up to 4K
resolution compatible games go that's it
that's all I needed HDR I also support
all I needed TV
[Laughter]
mode oh that's all I
[Laughter]
needed the Nintendo switch 2 doc has a
built-in fan that keeps your system cool
that's also interesting there's a fan in
here
okay uh-huh
obiously the only things that are
excluded are like
ring stuff but all the I mean everything
major isend Swit G they just show games
are supported
bro
bro I love the new little show I got to
see the new Pro Controller cuz now that
we know the mouse controls are confirmed
I want to see the double
mice
okay they're they're moving through a
lot of this saw Nintendo switch 2 is
isn't simply an improved Nintendo
switch we redesigned the system the
cooling fan in the dock is also kind of
wild Play features yeah it's only been
18 minutes to help players better the
switch to hardare T of we currently
developing this
game Mr
kaoto hello my current location is
actually inside the game
itself what this is Nintendo swi welcome
tour so this is like their asob nintend
switch the thing that's like built in
with it
maybe I'm standing over here what in the
world everyone join me inside the
game quizzes there little joint is this
let's examine
them the new IP is welcome tour where
are the
magnets okay so this has to be packed in
this is obviously built in system with
magnets and those magnets are inside the
system that's good that they did this
though the SL and Sr buttons on the
joyon 2 are made of metal they're
playing a game to basically teach you
all the different feates new dude I love
the magneet thing is awesome a MAG yeah
the manual is essentially a
game through examining signs like these
you can discover all sorts of secrets
about Nintendo switch 2 get little
quizzes another example the joy-con 2
controllers have Mouse controls and when
combined with the gyroscopes you can
even do something like
this you can adjust the position of the
golf club and aim for the cup basically
the different ways you can try things
yeah this definitely seems like a packin
for sure I think this is probably on
like every system gcop I can't imagine
they would sell this separately cuz it
is like tutorial how to use even as
you're playing mini games and Tech
demos yes there you go see they're
calling them Min the unique features of
the system to Tiny details you might not
notice until they're pointed out there
are plenty there are plenty
Nintendo switch 2 Welcome tour will
launch as a paid digital game on the
same day as Nintendo switch 2 so please
check it out if you're interested oh so
it's not a pack in now I'd like to share
some more information regarding Nintendo
switch 2 okay o I like the red is game
card for Nintendo switch 2 titles oo
okay it's the same shap obviously
makes but it's now I'm shocked they're
making you pay for that dat reading
speeds
next up is additional
storage switch 2 will only work with
micro SD Express cards it's
fine they're a different type of SD card
and will make highspeed data transfers
possible okay you use one please note
that regular micro SD cards used for
Nintendo switch will not be compatible
but Micro SD the ex one that's to
transfer data from switch to switch 2
you can log into your Nintendo account
to use the system transfer feature with
this feature you can transfer save data
digital games andile a lot of that stuff
probably won oh we we also releasing a
Pro Controller weird it doesn't look
like it breaks it has a c button which
launches game chat and on the back there
are new GL and gr buttons which you can
use to assign existing button controls
interesting so it's not going to split
and do them UPS an audio jack has been
added interesting we've introduced a few
new features and after today's
presentation the official Nintendo
switch 2 website will go live there will
also be an ask the develop ask the
developers they got to bring back more

5th before SU game Fest we're very much
looking forward to the day when you all

broadly
speaking on Nintendo switch 2 you can
play three types of games yes yes the
first time is Nintendo switch 2 games
June fifth is great these games take
advantage of the performance and
features of switch 2
uhhuh the second type is compatible
games that were released on Nintendo
switch we know this switch 2 Edition
here we go Nintendo switch 2 Edition
games here we go here we go here we
go some games that were released on
switch will receive upgraded versions
that offer things like improved visual
Here Comes breath of the wild Metroid
and more watch oh now i' to show you the
Nintendo switch 2 Edition
wasn't people were making fun of me it
was it was the jeree switch 2 Edition I
knew it look
new Super Mario Party is getting people
were making fun of me saying
I'm like yes I did it's my favorite
Mario the UPG expands on the game and
adds new features including Mouse
controls okay okay okay okay okay audio
recognition I bet you this will probably
be like a discounted upgrade then if you
already have jamere and gameplay that
uses a camera camera thing is so wild to
me all of which can be accessed on
switch
2 let's check out new and up you know
what I could see them doing I could see
them doing a thing where
like the upgraded version of your Bas
Nintendo switch game to players join the
your NSO online sub you be a to seees as
you play so you can experience all the
reactions but I don't think it's going
to be a base subscription I think it's
going to be like highend or your friends
can take the party
online like see the camera stuff I to me
that wouldn't be enough Bowser but this
new mode where theier team wins there's
no way this
0% chance I'm tell there's % chance coin
there's no way guide an RC car with your
voice
go I love incorporating the Mario Wonder
stuff too with movement and sound
finally take a ride on the mouse
controlled Carnival coaster with the
safety bar lowered and
secured you're off go it's so weird use
Mouse controls to shoot down enemies
while you feel the bumps and Rumbles be
fire if they were making
that I'm still sticking I think it's I
think it's 3.99 I really do maybe it's
450 but I don't I don't see it going
past 500 happen and where you shake a
can of spray paint and quickly tag there
are some really cool new features but I
don't think it's enough enjoy the I
don't think I don't think it's enough to
push it past 500 I think you guys are
worried for St I'd be shocked from mini
games that use a camera dude don't even
don't even don't even put that in The
Ether Lance don't even the BG yet I saw
Lance in my chat say Super Smash
Brothers Swit Edition and they add a
bunch of character switch 2 Edition
plus Launches on Nintendo switch 2 July
24th okay so this comes out soon after
all right Nintendo switch 2 players who
already own Super Mario 30 Jam can

Legend of Zelda breath of the wild and
tears of the
Kingdom feature enhanced resolution in

of the wild which makes the more vibrant

defition Graphics now these I'm
upgrading I'm upgrading for both of

morees in hyru using Zelda notes also I

the Kingdom with the building probess
the Nintendo Switch app on Smart devices

exclusive to the switch 2 editions of
these titles okay for example it can
help guide you to various loc I think it

beond and digital

were not going to make a switch 2
Edition knowing how Pokémon company is
I'm like bro to introduce a brand new
game featuring Mouse controls with the
joycon 2 controllers okay show us the
mouse con please take a look we're like
just about to hit 30 minutes there's a
lot of stuff in
this it be a new IP or something
what in the
world with your mouse controls you're
doing
basketball wheelchair
basketball this is their new IP drag
drive that actually looks like it could
to be fun so you're basically doing
this okay okay I'm down to try hopefully
we get to play this at the switch 2
event Henry yo my my buddy's name is
Henry he was an arms champ too I'll play
this with
him this ISS like this could actually be
really fun Imagine though after like 5
minutes you're just doing this like
this I'm just imagining a future smash
character where he's you're Wheeling
against the stage to throw the
basketball in someone's face
looks kind of fun though it's a it's got
like a little bit of a rocket League
Vibe though with like the ramps it's
almost like Nintendo's doing like a try
at Rocket League a little bit but
instead of obviously soccer they're
doing basketball which to be fair I like
basketball more summer all right so
that's so this is like their arms
equivalent then this is going to be
their arms equivalent that looks pretty
fun in Dragon Drive you'll use both Joy
and drive in pull drag X Drive

Mouse controls okay I love the little

Elden ring Final Fantasy 7 remake all
the stuff we were expecting and a new
exclusive from soft bloodborne spiritual
successor on a Nintendo platform and we
got a Hyrule Warrior Zelda game
like this is this launch is going to be
insane this year I feel like the only
thing that I'm disappointed by is that
they didn't say a price in this thing
that is saying to me that this thing is
going to be more expensive than 399 if
it was 3.99 it would have been in the
direct that says to me this might be 500
bucks it might be I don't I still don't
see it going up upwards of 500 the fact
yeah they showed silk song in Delta Rune
2
dude I'm I'm I'm blown away I'm Blown
Away the fact they didn't show 3D Mario
and that is
instead Donkey Kong
3D Donkey Kong is absurd them Sizzle
reeling silk song scissor reing it being
like Oh anyway here you go it's coming
60 FPS 4K breath of the wild tears of
the Kingdom confirmation we're getting
it for Metroid Prime 4 and for Legends
Za of course I'm playing both those
games on switch too guaranteed
guaranteed the donkey I have to watch
the Donkey Kong game again I have to I

voice might be
shot it's worth it I I cannot believe

ridiculous I re I like I thought he
might be going back to
Kirby and it's this year dude if we get
cting trial and it's orchestrated again
[Music]
dude dude Kirby air r i I can't believe
I can't believe that's
coming that is it's crazy

there's simply no way
what wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
wait wait wait wait you you guys are
trolling me there's no way hold on how
much is it wait Nintendo where is it on
nintendo.com 450 maybe I could see that
there's no way it's 329 like that it's
simply not happening Nintendo store
start shopping ask the developer where
is the price I got to see the price of
this thing where is it I'm not ending
the stream until I see the
price explore the systems okay where is
this it's 420 USD USD will probably be
3.99
bro if it's 3.99 they cooked
where I don't know where you guys are
seeing this though you guys are seeing
450 post the link please if you guys
have links post the
link
I switch to let's see
this console only no price yet please
check the official switch to website uh
what is the switch to website let's see
where is the switch to website I got to
see
this switch to website
thank you Rob appreciate it thank you
thank you thank you thank you thank you
thank you thank
you here we go here we go 450 so it's
not 500 which is good I said if it was
anything beyond 500 I would be
disappointed 450 is good I think for
what we saw during this Direct that's
fine I still fully believed it was going
to be 3.99 450 is not bad
I wonder then why they didn't show it
because I almost feel like that would
have been totally fine had they just
shown it there that's completely worth
it I'm fine with
450 it's $50 extra 450 is totally fine
again I think anything past $499 would
have been crazy the bundle is $499 so
basically you can get Mario Kart with
the system for
$4.99 I mean yeah for $4.99 and then the
switch system by itself
$4.49 also yes silk song confirmed this
year in Nintendo posted it bro there's
so much going on dude there's so much
happening I have to see that Donkey Kong
trailer again I said I was going to
watch it one more time before I end I
have been going for seven hours I have
to watch this again I have 5,000 people
still watching even though the direct
just ended I got to upload my full
reaction to this direct this is insane
but one more time I got to I have to
watch this Donkey Kong one I have to you
guys said it had synced audio we're
doing in
this we'll close these here we
go okay okay last trailer for the day
all right all right all right
bro I thought for a brief second when I
saw the little eyeballs I was like oh my
God are they doing banjo like a Nintendo
devel banjo but then once you see the
mine cart you know right away it's
Disney it's a little step but I could
accept it so Miles better than what I
paid for the PS5 Pro there you go dude
this game looks so good this is totally
The Odyssey team too you can I mean
clear as day you can see their
fingerprints all over this
[Music]
bro and there like golden monkey idols
or something in this cuz you can see it
was Ingot
Isle I'm playing this in like 2 days
listen to that music look at the
scale dude and the fact that this is
July again this is a stream game for me
we're
we're I am so I'm cooked in terms of the
amount of content I got Donkey Kong
Metroid Pokemon all this
year plus the switch two editions of
Zelda Kirby air ride
look at this
man and the music is
like spinning around to the top I didn't
see that the first
time and the fact that they bring back
the roots with the oh
dude
yoa now we know why they were pushing
donkey Gun Country Returns HD so much
they said we got to sell through that
game as much as we can before the brand
new one comes out
bro 3D Donkey Kong our prayers have
literally been answered 3D Donkey
[Music]
Kong I love all the new designs too of
the other weird little
monkeys and I really really like his new
design
too Donkey Kong Bonanza man
[Applause]
bro they cooked man they cooked they
cooked by the way Japan got a cheaper
price with region lock there's a source
by nendo Japan website oh they got a
region lock oh that goes back to what I
was saying earlier then that they might
do a semi- region lock
whoa I mean this was incredible I don't
I don't really know even know what else
to say 450 is a totally decent price
June 5th
great release date that's before summer
game Fest all the third parties can
announce their stuff for switch 2 that's
going to be like glorious bro new Kirby
air ride developed by Sakurai bro while
in the same breath in the direct Pokemon
XD Coliseum and soulcaliber with link
are on GameCube atso we got a new
fromsoft bloodborne successor exclusive
to Nintendo a new 3D open world donkey
platformer game that's coming out launch
window like these sound like fake
announcements I I thought Sakurai was
maybe working on kcep Rising or working
on maybe a new IP or something him
working on a Kirby airide
2 never in my wildest dreams did I think
that was going to be the case and you
guys know I have said this for years on
my channel that all they needed to do
all Nintendo needed to do was do a city
trial for NSO and have it where you drop
in the city and that's it that'll makes
so much sense the fact we're getting a
full-blown game and that it's this year
is absurd absolutely positively absurd
and 450 and Donkey Kong and Kirby and
all the switch like the fact they
straight up said switch two editions
Metro primee 4 Pokemon Legend Za don't
worry about it you got to switch to play
them on there love it love it love it
love it love it love it that's obviously
going to be how I play both of those
games I did not think in a million years
they were going to do one for Pokemon I
really didn't I like knowing Pokemon
company and how they are with their old
games I just I thought there was no way
they were going to do that the fact that
we got that and both zeldas and new hyro
Warriors it's crazy
man I have to render out my reaction I
got to upload tons of stuff I got to
sleep a little bit I got to get some
coffee I got to do Japan time I got so
much I got to do before I hop on my
flight this is absurd I love you all for
coming through to the stream this was
incredible what a strong start to the
switch to I I the fromsoft thing is
still also like melting my brain I
couldn't even believe what I was seeing
