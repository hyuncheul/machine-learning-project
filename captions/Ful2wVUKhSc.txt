it appears we are almost ready to depart
really we didn't have a bit more time to
spend on spell casting I presume you've
been practicing the Spells we worked on
I have Professor well I'm quite sure
I've never seen anyone take so quickly
to a secondhand wand you'll be a force
to be reckoned with when you get your
own
thank you Professor fake I appreciate
you working with me
foreign
cryptic description of our location did
not thought you're finding us more
vaguely to find destinations than this
though I confess I may have
miscalculated slightly on my first try
gave quite the Fright to some theater
goers in the West End
it's been much too long when I received
Doral I must say I best not speak here
Elias are Ellie's art
why don't we speak on route to Hogwarts
we have a start of term feast and a
sorting ceremony to get to wonderful
idea as long as your young child here
doesn't mind me tagging along not at all
sir after you
ages since I've been to the castle
would be good
[Music]
whoa yes
[Music]
well one of our brothers
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
glad I caught you before you left for
Scotland
just barely
and who is your traveling companion
a new student
how extraordinary it is indeed none of
the faculty has ever heard of anyone
being admitted to Hogwarts so late nor
have I of course as the other fifth
years will have been honing their
magical skills for four years now what
if I could get a new student up to speed
a bit before the term begins well you
couldn't have asked for a better Mentor
Professor fig is not only an exceptional
teacher he's also a remarkably intuitive
and gifted wizard
Mr ozric is prone to flattery I dare say
it's one of those reasons
have you seen this
I have opinions differ as to how great a
threat Round Rock really is and it was
your wife
she wrote to me about ran Rock before
she died
received this it was the last thing she
sent me earlier but with no
correspondence I can only assume that
she had to get rid of it quickly
to keep it safe presumably from ran Rock
I cannot open when the magic protects
this is powerful indeed it looks like
Goblin metal that symbol ISM was that
glow
I don't see a blow
nor do I
oh
did you get shingles
beard how did you wait
redeemed
oh
[Music]
[Applause]
um
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
are you all right
you're hurt
perhaps a bit
take this it's wig and World potion that
stuff will write you in a second
other boys
I can't believe
what the hell got into that damn thing
attacking a carriage mid-air
because the whole Dragon would never
professor
sir where are we
I'm not sure
but that key you discovered was clearly
a Porky Porky an item Enchanted to bring
whoever touches it to a specific place
I'm feeling better sir if you'd like to
look around it
I would
stay close
we have no idea who created this Porky
oh why
well
he take us
Carriage Traveler
somewhere in the Scottish Highway sir
those roads
pork he was meant to lead us there I do
this has not been the day either of us
expected but Miriam sent that Porky to
George for a reason
and I believe that she and now George
died in pursuit of whatever it was meant
to lead to
if you're sure you're all right and
wouldn't mind indulging me I'd like to
have a look around absolutely sir good
let's see if we can find a path
absolutely faded it may be
mind your step
[Music]
why do you suppose your wife got the
porky that brought us here a good
question Magic
[Music]
yes a powerful magic wielded by a rare
few that seems to have been lost to time
yeah
jokes
Hogwarts Castle was built by and is
itself a stronghold of that ancient
Magic
I don't know where she came into
possession of the pork key
oh yeah
why was your wife searching for evidence
of Lost Magic Miriam wanted to
understand why such powerful magic
disappeared from The Wizarding World
spoke of the good it could do but magic
is no different than any power
what really matters is the one who
wields it
oh
is that ice it's not cold enough here
it appears to be a sort of enchantment
someone wanted to block this path
together let's see some of that one work
expecto pector no focus on the center
okay
petroleum
wow
excellent
it was a bit rougher than I'd expected
your one works improving with every cast
foreign
whoa
you'll see what he goes in here
almost there
foreign
[Music]
why would someone build this here I
suspect they valued their privacy
that Porky led us here for a reason
let's have a look around for anything
that seems
out of place
[Music]
huh
[Music]
Professor it's a mural of some kind
perhaps our host was a noted seer
interesting
interesting
okay
[Music]
foreign
this may have been his home
that Enchanted crystallized Stone again
but what could it be blocking
what's this
professor fake
orange
why would someone have conjured that
Enchanted Stone here
and how is there a room behind it
what room
I don't see anything that's that glow
again like the glow on the porky
container
foreign
I don't believe it wow
hello
[Music]
it can't be
[Music]
uh just a moment
[Music]
welcome to gringott's Wizarding Bank
vote number 12 I presume
precisely
the key
the White's Pokey oh yes of course
this way then okay
stay close yes
[Music]
after you
[Music]
and keep your hands inside the cart if
you don't wish to lose them
[Music]
oh well
hundreds in fact you'll see quite a few
years
as we speak we just beneath the name of
him the volts you see now with the new
wall private entrances to the bank
common at Gringotts
comments and Colin only one with great
wealth or power all both could have
arranged for such a service
a what
other owls away all enchantments it's a
security measure
these are the love of us that we're
passing now how deep are we going box
number 12 was commissioned shortly after
Gringos was founded over four centuries
ago it resides in the deepest part of
the bank settling with quite a distance
to go
hold them
vote number oh
vote 12.
momentous day
Professor beyond that God was wearing
was glowing
like the clue you saw in the porky
container and the darker I saw that same
glow in the dragon's collar yeah what
was that we were just wondering about
that Goblin back there did he watches
over the oldest section of the bank
rare anyone goes there anymore
foreign
[Music]
has been stationed at my desk for
hundreds of years
in that time no one has visited vault
12. until today
[Applause]
[Music]
thank you for your help wow
what do you suppose we should be looking
for I'm not sure
so I wonder if you mean instructions for
Vault 12 indicate that I am to Grant
access to the holder of the key and then
close the door
wait what
is my wife
certainly unexpected
think
there must be something here
revelio perhaps
revelia yes a revealing charm no time
like the present let's see what we're
missing shall we
ready your wand and focus
um
crochet
rebellio
rebellio
that
[Music]
is
a start
there's that symbol again it's like
simple I don't suppose you see a weight
too I do professor symbol has the same
glow as the one I saw
if what you can see reveals the way
forward then I dare say we are about to
discover the secret of this Vault lead
the way
[Music]
Lumas wow
this is no ordinary Vault I suspect we
will need to earn our way out of here
what do you need to earn our way out
I think this is so
this is so test I do
but to what end I can't say
close there will be no disapparating if
things go poorly not out of Gringotts
yes possessor
what is it
that glow again but on the floor
oh you will
possible
[Music]
wow
when I moved towards the globe it
suddenly seemed as if the ground was
swirling about
are you all right
yes sir I'm fine
you seem to have caused the floor to
change
foreign
what statue
I see some sort of statue but only is a
reflection in the floor
Rebellion I presume this is what you saw
reflected in the floor you know it is
the reflection's still there but the
statue's positions don't match
when you moved the reflection turned in
the direction of the light
perhaps you should cast lumos
foreign
now the reflection is turning towards me
[Music]
wow your excuse me
foreign
foreign
isn't you
[Music]
nice
Professor that's a fake Professor where
are you
this isn't good where am I supposed to
go
happening
wisps of magic seem to be leading me
somewhere
it's where they're leading me
I wasn't on my own this time lumos
foreign
Cuba
foreign
foreign
the noise
lumos
[Music]
along
wow
some water
[Music]
[Music]
people go
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
that is no mere basin
that is offensive
for viewing memories
I wonder
ah
Follow My Lead
[Music]
ER
okay
all is in place
the porky is well hidden
I wonder if the path we've created
it'd be impossible to follow
it will only be impossible for one who
cannot see traces of ancient magic as I
can your ability to see what others
cannot will not be enough possible
possible we are entrusting the one who
embarks on this path with Powerful
Secrets with knowledge others will do
anything to obtain yes and if we are
correct Charles the ritual wizard who
completes the trials will have proven
themselves worthy of that knowledge
and the responsibility that accompanies
it
may have done all that we can
is
[Music]
that's what you're seeing
glow the rounded them yes sir
astonishing can I see Magic
traces of an ancient magic to be precise
[Music]
the magic that Miriam had always
believed existed
but never
[Music]
Miriam and perhaps George
died in pursuit of knowledge that has
been dormant for centuries
are you all right
fine sir
I've never seen so powerful a goblin he
seems
unaffected by my magic
where are we
it can't be
it seems those who set up the pensive
the locket and the path to both wanted
someone with your ability
to end up here
we have a sorting ceremony to get to
uh
[Music]
[Music]
wow full game
four blocks Legos
[Music]
foreign
good
the Sorting ceremony
I'm no expert but
that seems more now
I need to study this locket as soon as I
can but first I must contact the
ministry they need to know what happened
to George and be warned of ran Rock
for the moment I ask that you keep all
that's happened this evening between you
and me of course sir thank you
ready for the Sorting ceremony
[Music]
foreign
Phineas Knight jealous black
[Music]
prepare yourself to meet
the Headmaster
fig nice of you to join us
the Sorting sediment is over there were
complications complications it seems the
goblin promises
goblins like no time for rumors fig and
I'm rapidly losing whatever patience I
had left
because if you're lucky we might still
be able to get you sorted this evening
[Music]
Professor Weasley we've won more to be
sorted
welcome you're just in time have a seat
[Music]
is
[Music]
a bit older than the others aren't you
oh yeah yeah you come here with
preferences and preconceptions
certain expectations
[Music]
I'm looking forward to exploring
Hogwarts and the world beyond the castle
and grounds yes sir
indeed muds can be gleaned by having an
adventurous Spirit but your professors
have a great deal to teach you as well
I wonder
[Music]
what is it
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
Columbia
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
exceptionally daring
undaunted by the unknown willing to
forge your head alone when you must
perhaps you belong in Gryffindor
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I detect a growing sense of ambition and
eagerness for power
foreign
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
and one more thing due to the
unfortunate injury on the pitch in last
Spring's final this year's quidditch
season has been canceled oh
[Music]
it's not as though I've banned flying
all together but
don't tempt me
you are here focus on your academic
Futures I'm sure you will have plenty to
do before classes begin tomorrow
I said I'm sure you will have plenty to
do before classes begin tomorrow
quite an entrance it's lovely to meet
you I'm Professor Weasley would you be
so kind as to show our new student to
their common route
nice to meet you as well professor as
Deputy head mistress it is my distinct
honor to show you to your common room
right this way
foreign it's quite uncommon for a
student to begin as a fifth year it may
be a bit of a challenge
but one I'm sure you're up for
I can be quite resourceful I suspected
as much this is the entrance to the
Slytherin con room
in order to enter one must simply speak
the correct password aspiration
very well
aspiration
exploration
well done
now go on in and get some sleep
a big day ahead of you tomorrow I shall
be back in the morning to collect you
for your first class
thank you Professor Weasley you're
welcome thank you I hope you enjoy your
first night at Hogwarts
sleep well

can I help you
oh
you're the new fifth year
I'm Sebastian Salo welcome to Slytherin
thank you not everyone has a Ministry
escort to school he was a friend of
Professor figs who merely joined us for
the ride still impressive Dreadful way
to go poor fella
glad you and figure all right
it was Dreadful certainly but quite an
experience nonetheless interesting
perspective
how did you and fig managed to escape
it's all still a bit of a blur to be
honest didn't mean to press you just get
yourself settled we can talk more later
it was nice meeting you Sebastian I'll
let you get back to your book nice
meeting you too good luck today
I think that again
uh not going to move there are you here
watch this
don't say I didn't warn you
check a point
ah I know who you are you're the new
Slytherin the one who barged in with
Professor fig last night I'm Imelda by
the way shame I wasn't with you and fig
I could have lured that Dragon away my
skills in a brim are legends
perhaps Professor Fig's friend would
have survived if we'd had your help
precisely speaking of which I'd like to
get in some time on my broom before
classes
foreign
[Music]
doubt mermaids find us that interesting
based on all the chatter When you
entered the common room I'm guessing
you're the new fifth year I'm ominous
ominous gaunt nice to meet you ominous
Well you certainly had a memorable
arrival
well if I'm going to make my Mark here I
had to start right away
you're definitely in the right house do
let me know if I can be of any help as
you navigate your first days here though
I doubt you'll need it
thank you ominous very nice to meet you
pleasure was all mine don't be a
stranger okay
is the new fifth year Slytherin in here
Professor Weasley's waiting for you just
by the stairs
I trust you're ready for your first day
at Hogwarts I've been dreaming of this
day for a long time can't believe I'm
here well you are here make the most of
it you only have one first day at
Hogwarts now in light of your unique
situation joining us as a fifth year
you'll need to catch up with your
classmates and not fall behind
especially as you'll be expected to
complete your owls at the End of Time
owls
owls yes your ordinary Wizarding level
exams they will determine what type of
career you can have when you leave here
after much discussion with the
Headmaster and the department of magical
education at the ministry we've devised
something extraordinary to ensure your
success
here you are
thank you professor
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
I certainly would have appreciated
something like the field guide when I
was a student
using the guide will also train you to
be alert to your surroundings lumos
the guide will give you opportunities to
practice your magic and educate yourself
about Wizarding law okay
do keep up
why don't you cast reveillo on that
statue and see what details the field
guide can provide
revelio
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
side and outside of the castle
lumos
lumos
[Music]
[Applause]
revelia
Rebellion
I know
well let me also or expelliated
[Music]
rebelio
[Music]
ah good timing perfect opportunity to
show you how to use blue flames to get
around a bit quicker your Field Guide
contains a map of the Castle open it up
and find Central Hall Philadelphia
okay wow
thank you
[Music]
foreign
family
that should be all for now you'll be
expected to attend both charms and
defense against the dark arts classes
today
and I'd like to be sure you get to
hogsmead as soon as possible to replace
the supplies you lost on the way
thank you Professor Weasley a lot to
absorb on your first day and you have
much to learn happily your professors
have agreed to create additional
assignments for you outside of class
you'll be up to speed in no time judging
by your Adept use of revelio earlier I'd
say Professor figs succeeded in at least
showing you the basics you did Professor
he's been terribly vague as to the
events preceding your arrival
specifically about what happened after
that awful dragon attack my suspicion is
that there's more to the story than a
search for belongings and an extended
trip up to the castle
but I'm afraid that's all there is to it
seriously hmm
almost precisely what Professor fig said
Professor fig
your ears must have been burning oh yes
seem to have provided our new fifth year
with a solid foundation in the basics of
spell casting ah I'm afraid I can't take
all the credit there professor they've
around aptitude for magic it seems hmm
just glad you both arrived in one piece
very well enough chit chat I need to get
to class myself might I rely on you
Professor fig to explain the details of
the field guides map of course of course
me
it's good to see you professor and you I
was hoping our paths would cross today
before you immersed yourself in studies
did I hear you masterfully evade
Professor Weasley's interrogation
regarding our late arrival
I did my best
but I'm fairly certain she suspects that
we're not being entirely forthcoming yes
well Professor Weasley is a brilliant
and astute witch it was right to keep
the details to yourself for now okay we
don't know where this path we've
embarked upon will lead
it may require a bit more flexibility
with your time than she would approve of
and she may feel obliged to share
details with the Headmaster that would
be better left between us understood
Professor speaking of guides
and so that I may avoid Another Not So
subtle reproof from Professor Weasley
why don't I show you the clever
enchantment we included in the field
guides map unfold it and have a look
the map is Enchanted to help you find
your way this will be incredibly helpful
thank you I shall reach out when I have
more information about our mysterious
locket for now focus on your classes and
pay attention more than your owls May
hinge on the magic you are able to
master Within These Walls
comes on me though
wholly says
whole lot
s
of
foreign
so you are the new student
have you met Professor Ronan yet
Shall We Begin
welcome to year five of Champs now this
will be a crucial year in your education
on the art of charmwork but I am
confident that we will take hold with a
passion and rigor requisite of such a
challenge now everyone please open your
textbooks to page 517 but before we
begin can anyone here tell me the
difference between the incantations of
the color change and growth charts
anyone anyone
um
I I I I I am afraid it is too late to
study now
um
really taken a toll on you all
by the looks of it you all spent your
holidays practicing obliviate on one
another
do you even remember how to perform a
basic summoning charm
hmm
hmm well it seems that we are in dire
need of review everyone get into Pairs
and take positions on opposite sides of
the classroom now let's put those
textbooks to use as they blunt objects
you so believe they are and they turn
summoning them out of one another's
hands only one book will be needed per
partnership Miss Dale thank you get into
place now
thank you
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
that is not bad
oh what a swift learner
I see a lot of potential but remember
potential is nothing without practice
keep added you might just rival me so
nice
oh well
I've always found that fun goes hand in
hand with Mastery as I'm sure the
Quidditch players amongst us would agree
so
what better than a bit of sport
the prowess with the summoning charm to
the test right whoa
[Music]
so why don't we have our newest student
status off hmm
very simply cast Akio on one of the
Spheres and relinquish your charm at the
at the last possible moment
think of this like
oh holy Vegas
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
[Laughter]
very good points to Slytherin but
there's certainly no sporting playing
without some friendly competition Miss
onai would you care to give a new
student a bit of a challenge
you'll be the blues just as before and
miss you are playing red clear okay yes
sir yes professor
[Music]
whoa
[Music]
hey
[Music]
that's it here we go
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
thank you
[Music]
foreign

the enough chatter Focus now you will
need it
this round settles it all right

[Applause]
yeah yeah

[Music]
[Music]
foreign
kill each other
[Music]
very good both of you well done
um
classes dismissed gather your things on
the way out
[Music]
a tag game it turns out we were evenly
matched it took me weeks to become
proficient I took weeks for me to get
anything right when I transferred here
it gets easier I promise well it's been
nice talking and competing with you
and with you
until next time
[Music]
you wanted to speak with me Professor I
did I trust your first charms lesson
lived up to expectation well an outdoor
competition wasn't exactly the lesson
what charm is there in the expected and
what a close match between you and Miss
onai
invigorating thank you Professor I
enjoyed the match Miss onai is always a
fierce competitor though I sense that
she is a bit distracted of late
now Professor Weasley has asked that
your professors give you instruction
outside of the ordinary curriculum
expect to hear from me soon regarding a
special assignment that I am preparing
for you
foreign
[Music]
you gotta
so Professor hack it perhaps you'd be
good enough to blast each other to
pieces on your own time I get new
students every year but I only have one
hebridium black skull
it was a token from the great poacher
raid of 1878 no doubt you've heard of it
now you may be asking yourself how an
old woman like me single-handedly took
out the largest poachering in eastern
Wales and lived to boast about it
knowledge
wow to the wise age matters very little
today we will review a spell that has
saved me from Death at the hands of dark
Wizards more times than I care to
remember
levioso
leviosocial
wow a surprised opponent has a weak
opponent care to defend yourself master
Pruitt no
one thing I've learned as an unspeakable
is the value of Simplicity especially in
the heat of battle now let's practice
what we've just learned starting with
something small
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
let us begin with the
with the cost
here see how the dummy deflected your
cast
This Time cast levioso first then the
basic cost
remember a surprise
the basic cost very good but the best
way to practice is by dueling we'll
start with YouTube
[Music]
Welcome now I want a fair Jewel you
love yourself
you may begin
okay come on Sebastian
can you get some water
okay
all the case things
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
I put on the spot and he rose to the
challenge points just Slytherin thank
you Professor Hackett glad to have the
opportunity if what I've seen today is
any indication we can expect great
things from you thanks bro
[Music]
nice work
I enjoyed that well that duel was quite
something everyone will be talking about
it he did practice practice felt more
like I was trying
to new student to be so Deft with a wand
then again perhaps this wasn't your
first duel
foreign
you might be a perfect fit for a certain
exclusive unsanctioned dueling
organization
exclusive and unsanctioned Count Me In
excellent knew I was right about you if
you want to get the most out of your
time at Hogwarts you're going to break
the rules now and then oh whether it's
joining a secret jewelry club or sneaky
into the restricted section of the
library look for Luke and Brad will be
near the clock tower entrance if you're
interested
foreign
it's invitation early so you must be
awesome Sebastian oh
I seem to have a nap
how does crossbones work exactly you
show up I'm actually with other Duelists
and whoever is still standing in the end
wins it's our way of determining the
school's greatest duelist once and for
all
lighten things up the winner is awarded
the prize
interested
of course dueling's an entertaining
Pastime I agree this sides in crossed
ones you can deal with a partner if you
like your first time I'll pair you with
Sebastian next time you'll need to bring
a partner along or Jewel alone so care
to step into the ring
get me in the ring oh get me in the ring
let the fireworks spectacular let's go
regret signing up
okay
[Music]
foreign
there comes
muscle stupid pie
CE
for yourself
nice work Sebastian wasn't wrong about
you there's strong competition ahead but
keep this up and you could be the next
school Champion
Count Me In I shall
hope to see you back here again okay
foreign
alone
oh what about the room
I was thinking the same thing
perhaps you could help
oh excuse dick
ah there you are
I trust your first classes went well
they did Professor in fact Professor
Ronan will meet you outside momentarily
to assign your first one no regarding
the trip to hogsmead I mentioned earlier
we've arranged to replace the supplies
lost on your way here including seeds
potion recipes and spell crafts thank
you professor and Mr Ollivander will
connect you with the perfect wand you've
managed your classes well with a
borrowed wand but you'll find the magic
you cast with your own
far superior
wow
I'm eager to get dogs mate very well
I'd like you to make your first visit to
the
classmate
perhaps about Sebastian Salah or nazioni
I've noticed you spending time with them
oh yeah I'd like to go with Natty
excellent choice Miss onai is one of our
most talented students
undesirables on Route not record a
rather unsavory local best to avoid him
and his associates including his right
hand of sorts Theophilus Harlow if you
can once you've finished Professor
ronan's assignment your friend will meet
you at the castle doors no time to waste
the sooner you complete your work the
sooner you can enjoy a buttons
let's go
[Music]
you have a new spell to teach me
Professor indeed I do and an exceedingly
useful one at that The Mending charm
reperto fixes things right now
it seems as if that might come in handy
more frequently than one would imagine
as Professor Weasley mentioned I am not
the only one who will be teaching you
spells outside of class in an effort to
catch you up with your peers a number of
your professors have agreed to do so as
well but first each shall ask that you
complete a few preliminary tasks to hone
your magic I have arranged some for
today see them through and then report
back to me we will have you casting
foreign
this is the right area
I wonder where the flying pages
[Music]
now
flying page must be around here
somewhere
revelio Rebellion
I trust the preliminary tasks weren't
too much I completed the assignments
Professor marvelous you clearly know
your way around basic charms let us give
the old mending charm a try then shall
we remember to be deliberate in your
enunciation and movement I want to see
some Vigor now one at the ready yes sir
yes sir
remember your one is a conduit of your
magic
[Music]
ones on the left pedal
yes
that's it very good if you would like to
practice mending something have a go
with that broken statue in the Alcove by
the water it allegedly symbolized
Heartbreakers
yeah like something
I've never had difficulties
hello looking for me
nutty I hope I haven't kept you waiting
long
not at all
it tells me that you need to go to
hogspeed you must be eager to have your
own things again and to see the village
I've been looking forward to it good
the salary sets off
I intend to give you a first-rate
hogsmeade experience
[Music]
wow
[Music]
I was glad professori asked me to
accompany you really
yes I had planned to extend an
invitation to you myself I thought you
might enjoy it

do so
it's beautiful this time of year
everybody will tell you to visit at
Christmas
but that's one of the few times of year
I would rather be indoors

wow
oh wait over here okay
I often spot lace Wing flies in this
area
what's so special about them
but if you student you can also use them
in position
look from a Forbidden Forest hippocrites
I wonder if something starts with them I
heard rumors that he progressed
foreign
okay we don't know it
um
I will spend all of my time exploring
everything
I confess I was surprised when
professors got mentioned that you knew
the area since you're relatively new she
said that oh yeah
she knows more about me than I had
I will say well I certainly learn a
great deal in class much can be gleaned
outside of the castle walls
there is much to see outside of the
castle walls not just hugs meat I am
happy to explore whenever you'd like
rumors being what they are but wow it
might be nice to have a friend with you
I'll keep that in mind Natty thank you

[Music]
the three broomsticks is
and you can get any sweet you can
imagine at honeydukes
their favorite shop here it changes with
every visit
I can't tell you that you are certain to
find everything you need in Hog's meat
Professor Weasley said that you need to
get potion recipes spell crafts some
seeds and a new wand

I am Keen to see what you will do with a
wonderful you should be able to collect

had anticipated how perplexing
um

ah there you are
foreign

well
classical music
oh
something curious
oh it's quite well
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
wow
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
another beginning of a bright and
magical future ah
[Music]
how did that feel good different I sense
the sort of surge of some kind I'm
your connection seemed particularly
powerful the right wand will learn from
you just as you learn from it I'm eager
to try it out I would imagine so a wand
with a dragon heartstring core is
capable of dazzling magic and the bond
between you and your wand should only
grow stronger do not be surprised at
your new one's ability to perceive your
intentions
particularly in a moment of need that
sounds wonderful Mr Ollivander I'll let
you get to it do come and see me again
if ever I can be of further assistance
okay
foreign
[Music]
for the new fifth year I take it that's
you then
let me guess you're after something
fresh
okay
do have a look around plenty of
ingredients to pick your interests
[Music]
welcome to Jay Pippen's pushings
pardon me sir how may I help you today
Professor Weasley sent me to collect
some recipes I'm new at Hogwarts sure
the student she sent the owl about
what can I do for you today
free to take a look at the rest of my
inventory or come back another time if
you're in a rush today
and inquiring mind
let's look at what we have shall we
[Music]
if you are interested feel free to take
a look around at the rest of my infantry
well that's everything but I can't find
Matty
foreign
[Music]
I have everything I see what you meant
about not being able to pick a favorite
shop
we should walk around a bit more perhaps
today is the day I finally pick one
well
whoa
come on
throw it away from the buildings
oh
no no
no
it could be
okay
why you will
I was trying to beat him in his own game
Portuguese
foreign
I suppose so
it's all a bit of a blur to be honest
Merlin's beard are you all right we are
and we were glad to help I'd say help is
a bit of an understatement nerve like
that the makings of Anora if you ask me
if you are unharmed perhaps the two of
you wouldn't mind helping me put a few
things back to where they were of course
officer singer officer singer and thank
you
for power
foreign
extraordinaire I should like to thank
you for your remarkable bravery in
fighting those trolls and not to mention
your help restoring hogsmeade to its
rightful State I was happy to help
frankly you deserve an order of Merlin
but I could offer you something much
more useful I own Glad Rags wizardware
and among my inventory are some unique
items that affordable protections as it
were life-saving protections and as I
suspect this would be your last
dangerous encounter I'd like to give you
one such set of robes in thanks for what
you did today
thank you Mr Hill that's very generous
of you
I can do
let's try this on foreign
plenty for your perusal today take your
time
what's an extraordinary introduction to
Hog's meat
I would say that we and you in
particular have earned at least one
butter beer shall we head to the three
broomsticks sounds like a good idea
you said you could get to the child when
they came to hogsmeade they're all you
needed was a distraction I gave you a
distraction I just wanted a student take
down your distraction
who's this child what are you not
telling me
all you need to know is that if you
cannot get to the child then you have no
value to me
let's go
do they see us I don't think so what was
that Goblin doing with Victor Rookwood
van rock is working with Rookwood
the Goblin from The Daily Prophet I knew
I'd seen him somewhere
quickly let's get it
it's a treat to see you Lord God I shall
let you know if I hear anything thank
you sirona you be well
now what can I oh
there's a face I haven't seen before
welcome
the butter beer is on me
thanks for this my pleasure I will say
I think that now might be a good time to
head back to the castle
foreign
I'm glad to see you and I you thank
Merlin you're in one piece I heard about
the attack trolls in hogsmeade sir the
trolls were wearing armor
it had that dark glow like the dragon
collar Goblin silver
ranrock used it to control the dragon
but how
and why send trolls too they were there
because of me I overheard ranrock
talking with Victor Rookwood Grand Rock
was in hogsmeade with Rookwood the
trolls were ran rocks to get to me and
he would have had sirona and the patrons
at the three broomsticks not intervened
great news indeed if Ryan Rock's goblins
and dark Wizards are after you they want
what we found in that Vault they're
after the locket
you said you discovered something in it
yes yes
I discovered an inscription when I read
it aloud this map appeared
clever enchantment
of Hogwarts to be sure I do not know
where it leads
it leads to the library
a Restricted Section to be precise and a
bit beyond
I see traces of magic there on the map I
suspected you would see something shall
we go I appreciate your enthusiasm and
I'm eager to discover what we may find
there as well but if our experience are
gring Gods let alone what happened to
Miriam taught me anything it's that the
path we're on is terribly dangerous I'd
like you to work with Professor Heckert
a bit before we continue but sir how
dangerous could the library be perhaps
we're only after a book perhaps we are
only after a book that we should be
prepared for anything once you've honed
your defensive magic further come and
see me
to expect you
guys
I I'm here about the new spell you
wanted to teach me Professor good a
professor fig indicated a certain
urgency to you completing your defensive
magic assignments as such you are to
learn incendio the five spells thank you
for lighting torches burning away spider
webs and when necessary defending
against those who would wish to do us
harm
sounds versatile
concentrate and keep your wand steady
X in San Diego
whoa
incense
ah there you are hello sir you'll be
pleased to know that I worked on my
defensive magic with Professor Hackett
so I hear she tells me you've taken
rather well to your new wand you must
continue to work with her
to improve yourself that said I don't
wish to postpone our visit to the
library any longer
so shall we proceed let's go do this I
have work for you come head must I'm
with a student in my schedule your
schedule will wait indefinitely as will
your student
I would think that after all the trouble
you caused me with ozric you'd be eager
to make amends
my office five minutes
it is exasperating unfortunately our
trip to the Restricted Section will have
to wait a bit longer but Professor we
have no choice
it would be unwise to provoke our
illustrious Headmaster further
defeated whatever toils I must endure
foreign
Sebastian
Sebastian there you are I was hoping to
see you I was in the three broomsticks
after the troll attack and saw what
happened with Rookwood and Harlow not
many students have Victor rookwood's
attention what was that all about nadana
seems he's working with ran Rock and ran
rock is after something I found at
Gringotts ramrock and when were you at
Gringotts Professor fig and I ended up
there after the dragon attack it's quite
the tale figures to Gringotts I'm not
sure I follow I barely follow myself and
I was there he ended up in an ancient
Vault where we found a map that map
leads to the Restricted Section you
can't be serious deadly serious
Professor fig has insisted that I not
tell a soul about any of this I've
probably said too much understood your
secret's safe with me
whatever it is thank you Sebastian you
mentioned being clever enough not to get
caught in the Restricted Section and I
am
meet me outside the library tonight and
tell no one okay
thank you Sebastian I'll meet you later
foreign
that's the door we need to reach
and those annoying prefects would love
nothing more than to rat on us to
Scribner so don't let them see us
understood I can be sneaky let's go hold
on understood there's a spell you should
know the disillusionment charm oh good
for you this is you're not supposed to
be
cast it and you'll appear as little more
than a trick of the light just as long
as you keep your distance and stay quiet
you mean I'll actually be able to turn
invisible something like that it's not
as foolproof as a cloak but those are
expensive and spells spells are free
spell Mountain has heard anything
what kind of work here
um if I can see you the prefix might be
able to okay
turkey
s
okay
here quick you're behind the bookcase
okay she told me the librarian would be
gone by now
I said usually but it'll still be all
right do you see her desk behind me
the key is in the drawer of that desk
now here's what we're going to do I'll
create a distraction to draw her away
you focus on getting the key I'll meet
you outside of the Restricted Section
again
you distract I get the key understood I
said I'd get you in and I always keep my
word trust me
foreign
foreign
[Music]
each other
foreign
how to find that book
[Music]
oh that one's Charmed to look more
useful than it is it's fooled me twice
never judge a tone by its cover I say
foreign
this hour
ghost
s
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
no need for us to be skulking about
so what is it you've been looking for
I'm looking for a cure to help my twin
sister Anne so that she can return to
Hogwarts
Merlin knows everyone else has given up
why do you think we'll find a cure in
the Restricted Section does the Hogwarts
matron have nothing that can help Anne
no we've tried everyone from nurse
Blaney to Saint mongos
but I can research on my own no need to
concern yourself with that right now
let's focus on what you're after
which is what precisely
I'll know it when I see it
you're being awful cryptic
Channel
out exploring where they shouldn't be
naughty naughty you'll get caughty
peeves don't uh
[Music]
blaster the thieves I got to stop him or
at least get to the librarian with a
good excuse for all of this wait I don't
want you getting into trouble for me I
have a way with the faculty when it
comes to disciplinary matters they sides
I like having friends who are in my debt
now go good luck in your search
oh now where's that damned Poltergeist
got to
I know just the spell to repair this
armor
the puddle
these are Rebellion
oh
that's it
must be more to this room okay Rebellion
foreign
[Music]
the peril
ous
I need to wake up that Rune over there
we're in the world God's at the ready
times better
wow
oh
anywhere too
foreign
[Music]
this must be the way forward but to
where
exactly
foreign
[Music]
hit it well
incendio
keep here here here
foreign
foreign
foreign
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
Sebastian
anything in the Restricted Section again
with this clearly detentions are
insufficient
I'm afraid
but is that being said peeves informs me
that you didn't come alone tonight
if someone has coerced you I would have
you tell me
you're a bright boy
don't waste this
there was nobody else
I came alone
oh Sebastian
what will your uncle say
oh
in the Dragon
you cannot be serious goblins working
with Rookwood
makes no sense
it is rather unorthodox to say the least
awesome it's inconceivable it's
ah fig
you'll have a visitor
I'll see what I can find out
sir I was able to search the Restricted
Section while you were with Professor
black
it was a book we were after
what that's
[Music]
thinking on it perhaps it's best you
spare me the details fair enough
in fact the book was below the
Restricted Section as it appeared on the
map I want to hear everything first
let's have a look
oh
oh dear
did you seem to be missing
it appears
before us
and we don't need time to study what
remains
perhaps we can still Salvage something
useful that may take some time
I wonder why it was here below Hogwarts
I think I know sir
I saw two more memories where I found
the book another pensive godric's heart
the man we saw before Percival Rackham
was a professor here the first memory
showed him and three other professors
being ancient magic to restore a hamlet
from a drought Miriam was right and the
second memory they were talking to a
student who started as a fifth year like
I did
she could see traces of magic too why
those memories
hmm
this book will explain now I'll have to
take it with me to London the Headmaster
has insisted that I speak directly to
the minister about George's death I
understand I'll see what I can learn
about the missing pages while you're
gone good
don't neglect your studies your one work
is improving by the day because you will
want to pay attention in herbology and
potions
there's more to Magic than spell casting
plenty to keep me occupied while you're
gone exceptionally well I look forward
to seeing all that you've accomplished
when I return
and don't neglect your friends you may
be surprised by how much you can learn
from them as well
thank you
