Okay, can see gifted 10 subs. So, what
he says goes right now. He says Shyvana,
we're playing Shyvana. Don't call me a
sellout. This is called doing smart
business, not sellout. Smart
businessman. I'm going to have to play
AD Shyvana. We have too much AP. It's
okay though. We can do this. So, let me
show you AD Shyana. Let's go Galaxy
Shyana. I'm going AD Shyana. A build
you've never seen before. You've never
seen this build before? Cuz I've never
even seen this build before. We're going
to experiment. It's fine. We got this.
All right. Here we go. I was about to
Wait. I was about to go from master to
iron in a single day.
All right. Watch me. Watch me. You're
going to be so sick of winning today.
You're going to be begging me to stop
winning games today cuz it's just too
boring. All the wins. All right. Here we
go. Uh, wait. I forgot. Do I go
W? Is W second correct or is it Q? Oh,
good.
Vital just subscribed.
I actually
think I actually think Q might be better
second. If you start blue side, that is.
Yeah, if you start red side against W's.
All right. But if you start blue side,
yeah, I think you should do that. Yo,
Vitals, thank you for the new primer.
Appreciate you. Welcome,
dude. Are we correcting yesterday's run?
Yes. Yes. Yes.
We're going to only win
today. Uh, we need some vision here. I
have no vision, bro. I don't know why
people don't like using their
wards. Oh
well. All right. Oh, look at that. No
ward. You got ganked. Now you have no
flash. Wouldn't it have been better if
he just
warded? He did ghost. Actually, he might
walk around here. He might. He might try
to pipe up. promised
1,14 just resubscribed for 7 months.
Listen chat, night blue is going to win
so much. Do much. You are going to get
tired of winning. Come on. He has no
ghost. No ghost. I've never seen this
amount of winning every single day and
night. Win. You have got to understand
that you will get sick from so
wait we died with flash barrier slain
ka she died with flash barrier how is
this
possible oh well can't help
that I can't improve their skill
unfortunately that's not in my
uh power wow
Yikes. Yikes.
Yikes. I mean, dude, I'm not going to
lie to you. I am actually in losers
queue. I w I have worst players on my
team. It's just a fact. My mid's
underperforming. My ADC died with both
sums up, right? Like, it's just
unfortunate, bro. But we are going to
win every game nonetheless. To tell you,
we're going to win every game. An ally
has been slain. Even my top laner
gapped. Everyone's gapped every game.
It's fine. No, it's fine.
Actually, to be fair, he did kill her
earlier.
So, but it's
fine. All right, my Gromp spawns here.
Um, do I still want to max Even though I
am going Triforce? That is a question.
Quiet before battle. Does anyone
remember? Wait, his raptors are up.
Huh? Guys, for 80 Shyvana, do you know
if you max
earq? Does anyone actually
know? I could take his kugs, too.
Actually, I do have more items than he
does. I'm stronger 1 v one, I believe.
Oh, good.
Mystic missed
1,14 gifted five subs.
Did you even do any damage? I think I
might be dead, too.
Yeah, focus.
Bro, my mid laner is uh disaster. He's a
disaster.
An enemy has been slain.
Okay, my my mid laner didn't use a
single ability on Hecub. Not a single
ability. Not one. I expected at least
one.
Billy me.
Yeah, you kill him. You kill him.
I think Q probably
Q. All right, I'll do that. Yo, Mystical
Miz with the resub and five gifted.
Thank you so much, dude. Can we get some
gifted chats for him? Thank you. Thank
you. Someone give me the
shotgun. Someone hand me the shotgun,
please. I need to take care of something
out in the back here. Anyway, thank you
so much, Mystical Mist. Appreciate you,
dude. You're a legend. Hope you're doing
well today. Thank you so much for your
generosity,
bro. Um, all right. Let's try Q Max.
Let's try Let's try W. I think Q and W
on AD, I believe, cuz the W is nice for
the movement speed as well, which will
be nice to get your autos off. And
especially Kite will be very, very mad
this stream because Mr. Blue will win
every game this stream. Let's go, Night
Blue. I got you. Yes, we're going to win
every single
game. Every single game will be a W
today. I tell you, every single
one. Almost level six.
Excellent. Hard to gank for me
here. I mean, I guess we could try
something. I go.
God
damn. God. Damn.
This is kind of rough, but I I need
level six, dude. I need level six. Oh,
Lux is top. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's
fine. There's three top. All right.
We're going to have to mute this donkey.
He's underperforming and now he's
spamming us. Oh, here we go.
Boom. That was a nice
snipe. That was a really nice
snipe. Um, can definitely take his Gromp
time here. Thanks, mate. I'm going to
kill Lux on the way back. Smiley face
emoji. Thumbs up emoji.
I might have to just kill Lux here. I
The thing is she can just queue me,
right? So, I need my help. I need my
team's help here or it won't
happen. Uh, never mind. Never
mind. Yeah, unfortunate timing for us
there. We have a Hecrim coming.
We take those. We take those. That's
fine. Wait, we have to Leo wall. We have
to Leo wall. Here we
go. He might He might come back for his
fourth
shot. What a
coward. All right, at least the wave's
even. It's fine. Not a big deal. Ah,
they see
me. I can't recall
here. All right, it's fine. It's fine.
It's fine.
AB, there's some weird sounds coming out
your basement.
Yeah, I'll take care of it. Someone hand
me the shotgun.
I sweeper
now. Uh, it's okay. I'm going to farm.
My blue sight's still up. Uh, my mid
laner is like allergic to warding. I
don't know why. Two wards available.
Doesn't want to drop one. Since the
beginning of the game, this guy doesn't
want to ward anything. It's kind of it's
hard to play with a mid laner who
doesn't
ward. It's like the the worst. Any other
role is like tolerable, but mid lane
kind of needs to ward since they have
like so much uh blue three. I've been
watching your content since I was a
sophomore in university. Since then,
I've completed my bachelor's, earned a
master's degree, finished my PhD, became
a professor, and now I serve as the
chairman of my department. Thought you
don't know me, but you've been a part of
every step of that journey. Thank you
for the entertainment. Dang, dude, you
sound successful. Let's go. It
truly. Yo, that's awesome, bro.
Uh, one
HP. Well, two flashes, I suppose, is not
terrible.
Yo, what up Dealt? How you doing
today? I wonder if my clear speed is
good as AD Shyvyana. I haven't Dude, I
haven't seen anyone play AD Shyvana in
so long. This will be really
interesting. Really have no expectations
here. I'm not sure what to what to see
what we're going to
see. Grubs are in 15.
Lux is
missing. The problem is I'm in an ELO
now where I'm like low like high diamond
low masters where it's really hard to
play with my team cuz they're just like
kind of bad, bro. Like like if we dive
this guy, they might mess it up. You
know what I mean? I can't rely on them.
It's kind of sad. But when you're when
you're with when you're like playing a
game where your team's unreliable, you
kind of have to play for yourself, you
know?
Unless I get grubs here probably. An
ally has been slain.
You did masters and PG and Nepoon is
still an emerald. What? Emerald? What
are you talking
about? You actually can kill these so
fast if you're dragon form. And it
actually refreshes your dragon form
really
nicely. All
right, I'm going to max my Q here
and then I'm going to actually do um
Oh my
god. Oh, nice. An ally has been slain.
Kill for kill. Not the worst. Not the
worst.
Um let's go ahead and hit this.
30 seconds on dragon, but I kind of want
to path up.
There we
go. Let's smite this.
This guy's building a hexrinker. He
thinks I'm going AP Shyvana. Oh, that W
was kind of a waste.
Ain't no way, bro.
Nice. An enemy has been slain.
You saw
nothing. You saw absolutely nothing. Oh
god. Yow. Yo, he's in there.
Congratulations to that guy. I also
would love to thank you for being
my board exams as a medical
technologist. Now I passed it this April
4th and since one thank you for your
contribution. I would love to extend
mine in my viewers are so successful for
my school journey. I've been looking
forward to watching your edited videos
to the stream itself. Thank you dude. Yo
Green Angel, congrats bro. You guys are
all so successful. What the hell?
My stream creates winners, bro.
Hello, Mr. Night Blue 3. I have been
watching you since I was only 5 years
old. And since then, I've got my high
school diploma, finished college, got a
good nine. I can I can I can snipe this
guy. And had an entire family. I am now
in my 90s. Thank you for all the
content. Dude, I could I have killed
both if I was like less like
maybe.
Yo,
congratulations. God, you guys are all
so successful, bro. I'm like so proud of
you guys. thing about living in Sweden
is that I can only watch one or two
games on the stream. Then I have to
sleep so I can work in the morning. But
welld deserved subs for you, man. Keep
doing what you do and stay positive.
Smiley face emoji.
What the hell? What do you think about
Fiddlestick's
top? Just beginning to play it a lot.
Smile and right now it seems
unstoppable.
Uh, Fiddle is really good. You doing
today? After watching, I finally went to
therapy. No, not see my hairline growing
back already.
Dude, Fiddlesticks is a jungler, not a
top laner. You dummy. The heck you
doing?
All I got my booties. I think my Gromp
spawn soon here. Should be fire.
Your team has destroyed a turret. All
right, we got we got three grubs, two
dragons. Looks good. Looks good. Looks
pretty good. My wolves will spawn soon,
too. Yep. Perfect timing, perfect
efficiency,
cuz we know Hecrim took him earlier. I
could go mess with Hecrim, but I just do
not have mid pryo at
all.
Um, still could. Oh, yeah. Top is like
killable. Very killable. Yeah, I think
we make a play top here. I don't have
anything spawning anyway.
And I just finished my egg. Beautiful.
Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Oh, I
do have stuff spawning. I'm stupid.
Oops. I'm
coming. I got him with a Q. Got him with
a boom.
Let's keep going. Let's put Let's bring
people here. Let's bring them to
us. Yeah. Nice. Farm those. That's good.
I mean, they're they're pushing mid
right now.
Why is Lulu there,
bro? Lulu's by herself. What the hell?
She's just randomly mid
lane. Leave. Okay, we probably have to
leave
now. Did we get spotted there? No.
All right, I'm here.
Caitlyn is an attack damage carry, not a
jungler. That's what you sounded like
right then. Caitlyn is the female Graves
and Fiddlesticks is the scarecrow.
I died for your sins.
Like, I'm trying to leave, bro. It's
fine. It's okay. It's fine. I'm okay.
Oh, well, I should have just let this
guy
die. I'm going to see if I got an answer
to my uh thing here, to my dilemma I
have currently today.
How do you do that? years. Wait, what?
Hey, Mr. Blueg. I've been watching you
for years. I went through high school,
college, graduated, got married, and
started a family. Then I started
watching you again. I lost my job. My
wife become homeless, and now I suck
Gizzy for a living. But hey, nice
street.
Wow, you sound really successful. I'm so
happy for you. That's awesome, bro. I
really love that for you, man.
Congratulations. All right. Do I kill
this this wiener crocodiloala?
He might have a heum hovering old man.
Jungle now is playable jungle now. I
tried and didn't like it. And talking
about emerald diamonds.
I'm going to save my alt. Talking about
emerald diamond.
No. Give it to me you wiener. You don't
deserve it. I hate youestroyed.
Sorry, lost my cool there. My bad,
bro. Like, she doesn't deserve it,
though. Like, what? Like, you're just
feeding the whole game. Feeding the
whole game. And then you take my
shutdown that I got for us. I ka.
Okay, it happens. It's
fine. We have 30 seconds on dragon. I
lose my whole blue side if I
uh if I don't go now. It's now or
never. Going to lose her. If I go to
blue, I might have an angle on
dragon. You have vision of blue at
least, which is nice. Do I trade my
whole blue side for a dragon? I mean,
not the worst idea, but my bot lane and
mid have to reset. Okay, that's fine.
And I have to hold this wave anyway. Oh,
good. Just resubscribed for 9 months.
Welcome back. You are the best thing for
my ADHD brain to listen to. Okay, we
might have to just give this dragon. We
have no way to get it, unfortunately.
Yeah, give it. It's a losing fight. We
have 30 seconds on Oticon, though.
Please.
I have Sunder Sky in a second here.
That's going to be fire.
I think we just play tier two top here.
Honestly, just sucks that I can't really
reset here.
Actually, I have to recall. Oh, nice.
He's not doing it yet. But is she going
to feed again? Of course she is. She's a
fat feeder. Of course.
Shabona. Oh, I got
hit. Oh my god. AC130
action. This is good. Oh, he used his uh
he used his
fear. You gone.
Oh, nice, nice,
nice. You gone. And that's a free cone,
baby. That's a free out ofone. Someone
should go defend.
Good job, Kenan. Well played. Well
played, Kenan. We're gonna win every
game today, Kenan. You
understand? Every game will be a
W. I hope these TTS messages are going
wild. Yeah, everyone is so successful.
Dude, there's one thing in common for my
viewers that watch my stream, and that's
everyone that watches this stream
becomes very
successful. I think there's a
correlation,
gentlemen. Oh my
god, man. I'm such a donkey. Gave them
that
one. Tomorrow's the next patch. Yeah,
tomorrow's new patch. New map. New
patch. Wait, actually, guys, does the
new map hit tomorrow? Cuz I know the
season ends tomorrow, but does that does
that also mean
that does that also mean that we're
getting the new map tomorrow? Can anyone
confirm? All right, this is good. We got
a conon. We're going to play for tier
two. Actually, what am I building
next? Chad, what would go well with this
build?
DDY.
I don't know what else should I build
here, guys. Hey, we have a nice build
going on so far, but like what's next,
you know?
I'm going to push out this next wave. I
I don't care if they come to me.
They're all mid right now. This is kind
of good. Oh, good. Mongus core hunter
just resubscribed for 18 months. Oh,
they have heralds. Oh, shoot.
I have to I have to go. I have to go
from behind. I'm going to I'm going to
gank him from behind. Turret has
destroyed. Wait for Tia. Wait for Tia.
The reason why we are so rich,
successful, and not balding is because
everything you say to do the opposite of
it. Like when you invested in
boom. Come on. Where are you, you fat
cow? Wait, why am I so aggressive to
this guy? What did he do to me? Since I
started watching NB3, I got my masters.
Great job, beautiful. And that's how you
play the map, baby. There's no end to
what you can do when you blatantly lie
on the internet. That's how you play the
map.
What? Lie? Wait, what am I lying
about, bro? I'm not lying. Your mom and
I, we hooked up last night. It's not a
lie. Ask her.
Sorry, I'm way too old to be making
those jokes. Sorry. My bad, bro. That
won't happen again. I
apologize. Yeah. What do you guys think?
Oh,
I'm coming.
I will murder them. An en has been
Shana.
Bro, Parish, what are you doing? You're
living for way too long. No.
Oh, AP Shyvana would have killed her
there. Not going to lie.
Nice.
Nice. You guys like how we're playing
the map right
now? Like we're playing the map like
crazy right now. This is actually a
really educational map play. You know
what I mean?
I'll give them raptors. It's fine. I
don't know what Okay, someone said build
shun and collector. I think you guys are
drunk out of your minds. Why would I
build such dumb items like shojen and
collector? Like, are you guys even
taking the game seriously?
Like, you really want me to build an
item that's going
to like show and collector? Like,
really? Feel like you guys don't take
the game seriously at all, man? You know
what I
mean? Let me show you what I'm actually
going to buy.
You holy [ __ ] Liam. Mr. Blue is
cheating with a shatter's mother beating
adverage. Type one if you think I'm an
in. Type two if you
think. Never
mind. Come here you coward. I have
Infinity Edge with your name on
it. Nice.
That's what I'm talking about, baby.
Hold that. Yep. All right. Over here.
Gentlemen, gentle ladies, it's time to
secure the Baron.
Help me. Every time I come here and
learn something from your stream, I
somehow drop a full division or three in
one day. Chat, listen. The best advice
is the opposite of Night Blue 3. His
match history is more red than Communist
China with more deaths. No,
bro. Sorry for screaming. That was my
sister. Ow. Oh, wait. Bro's kind of
cooking though. The
enemy will fall. Wait, am I cooking?
Wait, should guys, should I do LDR or
shield bow? Which one? I think LDR. I'm
not a coward. I don't I'm not I'm tanky
enough as is. Infinity edge great for
infinite edging.
Uh I don't we don't do edging on this
stream. I'm going to take this. Hecrim's
here. We take those. He's gone. All
right. Now, where's Ribbon? Where's the
rest of these gooners?
They should run now.
I killed.
Holy.
Sorry. Coughing.
We have to 1 31. Please stop dead
clicking. It's all I can hear. You do it
so much you can't even hear it any.
You're next.
Not bad. Not bad. Dead clicking. Do I
dead click a
lot? You kind of have to know on
Shyvana.
Or am I
coping?
Oi. All right, let's get out of
here. Yeah, it's hard. It's hard, hard,
hard, hard. Push. It's fine. Am I dead
clicking too
much? I feel like on Shyvana you kind of
have to cuz she has resets. She resets
her Q. It's like Evelyn. Well, she
doesn't have a reset, but you know what
I mean.
I go,
am I dead clicking too
much? We'll get him eventually.
Uh, we still have Baron. Oh, we have
Baron still cuz of Vaticon. Oh, we just
ran out, didn't it? Wait, no, we still
have it. Oh,
barely. I mean, we should get the inhib
if we have HP to do so.
I am dead clicking with my W and my Q. I
see.
You kind of have to on Shiovana, man. I
don't know what to tell you.
What is dead clicking like this? Like,
hold on. Hold on. Just resubscribed for
30 months. Welcome back. I love your
video. It's like when you have a cool
down like Thank you for always being my
goto entertainer. Like if you spam an
ability that the cool down is still on
cool down.
10 seconds for cloud.
Yeah. Wait, should I go shield bow or or
LDR? What' you guys say?
I'm going to go
by. What's What's bro doing in my jungle
right now?
Oh, it's time,

you know what I mean. Sorry. Okay.
Sorry, that was too far. My bad.

through our our super here? What the
hell? Oh, hello.
And

Boom. Za. Ah, I don't
care. Who's

go.
Boom. Boom.
Uhoh.
Okay. Sorry. My bad. Sorry. First game
of the day. Got to get my energy out.
We're not losing a game today. I told
you we're not losing a game today. Today
we're playing for real. Look at that
damage. 80 Shyvana is back.
