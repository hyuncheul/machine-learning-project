I've only realized now I I always used
to say like you know I'm a left-handed
person but I don't actually do that much
with my left hand like I've never needed
left-handed scissors or left-handed
Mouse so on and so forth but I am
finding now that I can't use my left arm
I do do a lot of awful lot of stuff with
my left
arm like you know squeezing shampoo
bottles or Cosmetics or
eating or lifting up a gloss of
water I'm trying to eat with a fork in
my right hand right now and it's [ __ ]
awful re dinino thank you so much for
the sub thank you thank you what I do to
my arm I don't know it's so bad like it
is
Agony yeah battles Mir thank you for the
42 months redino thank you so much for
the sub and kitsuna Zer thank you for
the 21 months like it is actually like
a lot of pain just sitting around and
then once I start doing stuff with it
it's it's Agony it's
like yesterday after stream I tried to
like uh pick up a mug of
water and my I didn't have any grip in
my hand so it started to slip and you
know out of just reflex I jerked both of
my hands forward to steady it and my arm
felt like it was it was going to like I
don't know spasm right off of my
shoulder ASA thank you for the 3 months
Andy thank you so much for the sub thank
you thank you but yeah no it's like a
weird like I don't know twinging popping
pain that starts like in my shoulder and
goes like down through the upper muscle
and I can't even stand up straight
properly I don't know maybe a trap
nerve mine ghost thank you for the 17
months thank you thank you yeah pinch
nerve I think it's something like that
because it hurts a
lot but yeah it really it's really bad
when I take painkillers I can almost
function like it still hurts but it's
not like so debilitating that I can't
move my arm but I feel like taking
painkillers and then forcing my arm to
move is probably not doing a whole lot
of good for me long
term mang go thank you for the 17 months
and thank you so much for the 13 months
thank you thank
you so depending on how I feel this
evening I may not stream or I may just
like chat for a bit cuz I think even
holding a controller is probably a bad
idea lovey taals thank you for the 13
months and toxy Moxy thank you for the
100 bits thank you thank you
but yeah no I don't I don't know if it's
like common to hold your fork in the
non-dominant hand I'll trying to hold a
fork in my right hand feels very
unsteady right
now thank you
friends just morage thank you for the 28
months thank you thank you but yeah I'm
eating my lunch right
now use your non-dominant for Forks
that's
interesting what's for lunch turkey
Curry infinex Infinity thank you for the
30 months thank you thank
you but I mean I put my knife in my
non-dominant hand I didn't realize that
was uncommon
yeah I'm hope I'm hoping it's just that
I slept on it badly and then kind of
exacerbated things by just you know
doing what I do and it will go
[Music]
away am I happy and healthy well my arm
hurts but otherwise I'm doing pretty
well
I have not had a treat in a little bit
unless you count yesterday's bubble tea
we might count that as bubble
tea yeah I don't know
Richard I'm not expecting anything other
than maybe one or two game announcements
if that because like it's mostly a
hardware direct as far as I'm aware but
they they might intro or they might
announce like you know system launch
titles kind of like how the switch one
was announced with uh bloodborne breath
of the
wild yeah it's an hour long so there's
got to be
something and you are on your back you
look very cute
asreal wolf thank you for the two years
thank you very very
much no don't put yourself underneath a
chair oh Leon I want to be able to move
today all right let me get to this
Nintendo page in
prep whenever I'm like leam why would do
you do this he just looks up at me and
he like Smile Smile hello I am full of
love
smile you couldn't possibly be finding
me Annoying could you I'm too cute
uhhuh he's full of lies that's what he's
full of
he was good for his walk today though
met three dogs and did not make a
fuss I I don't think I think if
massaging it was going to get rid of the
problem it would have gone away by
now thank you
though that's a reflection of their
owners did I tell you about like the te
teenager that like spotted she was she
was playing in the park and he spotted
Leon first because he's cute and tiny
and she was like a cute
dog and then she looked up and went oh
my God they match and pointed at my
hair if the audio is moring it's
probably a low latency bug you can try
pausing and playing alternatively turn
off low
latency corus thank you so much for the
N9 months thank you thank you
hey jny
dog yeah it was real nice of Sony to let
Nintendo announce the port of their uh
previously played station exclusive
that's
crazy thank you so much for the two
months thank you thank
you I don't know how to eat without
making a mess because I can't hold the
bow or the fork in this hand this
sucks hi Jesus
the monster Zelda thank you for the
three years thank you thank you is that
what you're betting on for this I don't
know dude I feel like we've had a Zelda
2
recently soaky thank you for the 100
bits thank you thank you
oh I hope you feel better soon go
life but yeah I have faith that
everyone's wildest dreams will come true
and nobody will be negative about the
direct at
all which is always how it works
[Music]
I like how when I'm linking my twitch
stream is still says I'm playing repo
with Yuzu B
pppa okay
together Noble NY thank you so much for
the entire year thank you thank you what
emote did I get this time oh no look how
said he
is when was the last time there was a
Star Fox
game ow
yes I always mute the direct on
stream no sorry on the VOD on this live
stream it will be playing audio but the
VOD will have no
audio the last starf box was in 2015 so
it could be it could be do something
[Music]
I I don't know do you think they'll
announce a bunch of like what what a
slam dunk it would be if they announced
like a launch lineup of like 20 freaking
games that would be insane and very
[Music]
cool I don't see don't see it happening
but an hour is a very long oh no way
what if it's only an hour because
they're going to explain basic features
like face buttons in the same way that
they explained like digital games in the
last
direct thank you so much for the three
months and nro thank you for the two
months thank you thank you you know you
know where they were like this is
digitally represented on a cart you take
the cart and you put it on another
console it's going to be like like that
but for every feature of the switch too
[Music]
I believe on a couple of the things on
the last direct they said it would be
like I feel like they said X and or you
know this thing would work on switch 2
but that might have purely been the
hardware future I don't remember near
room thank give for the 15 months thank
you thank
you would you like some rice
chat a single grain per chat member
how's my arm holding up I slept in like
hourong bursts because every time I
would move my arm would jar and wake me
up
the only reason I got through my morning
routine is cuz I slammed some
painkillers beforehand it was like slam
some painkillers wait for the pain to
numb a little bit and then like jump in
the
shower yeah and do it just like Dr house
because he's is very cool to emulate as
a
person toss him up in the air and catch
him in my
[Music]
[Music]
mouth uh Iber proof friend is an
anti-inflammatory as far as I'm
aware let's find out pretty sure it
[Music]
is it is
yeah listen to all my drugs
[Music]
can you imagine how many retailer sites
would break if they were like and after
all this information we've given you
we're happy to announce the switch
orders or switch pre-orders begin right
now going to go open like Argos and
curries and and prep is game even alive
anymore Warehouse clearance oh
that's a little bit end of an era isn't
it I don't trust them anymore last time
I ordered something from them they said
they canceled it then didn't cancel it
and then sent half the package so I
don't
[Music]
know lit of loathing thank you for the
five years holy moly thank you thank you
this feels like it would be so annoying
I went on to the Argos website or sorry
the Curry's website hi do you need any
advice before you buy call a shop live
expert and I just have like this vision
of someone who's incredibly computer
illiterate like calling this person and
being like and asking the most like
absolutely crazy questions about just
random ass products that have nothing to
do with each other
[Music]
got five
minutes it's also kind of depressing I
feel like if you go to like a physical
CX store as well there's only actually
like one shelf of retro games now it
used to be like a treasure Trove and you
could go and dig through and look at all
of their older games games and stuff but
not so much
anymore I'm sorry easy I can't believe
there's a contagious case of bad
shoulder and arm going
through I'm not saying it the other way
because then I have to explain to the
Americans why I why I'm saying I'm in
sex hi Oscar hello
why is chat moving fast we're all very
excited when was the last time when was
when did the switch come out let's look
switch One release
date 2017 so we haven't been able to
gather around and and speculate about
the new Nintendo console in like 8
years is it naruga armor
[Music]

[ __ ] I went onto my like window capture
for
uh is there a way to stop it from Alo
hooking capture method no
that's so
annoying fortunately the scene wasn't
visible if it had been visible it would
have been like my entire dashboard for a
third- party site which would have been
very
awkward it was like yo do you want to
capture this
no Rex thank you for the six months
thank you thank you I really really
don't
hey chat it's almost time it's almost
time we got two minutes oh no they don't
have any audio just sitting staring is

really nice but in reality it's going to
be that gorgeous like under the
can you wait for me honestly that's
chill for people who enjoy that kind of
thing I'm fine with it
but I don't know I don't think anybody I
hang out with will use it but you
know little this
way using game chat even when you're
aart you can play games and hang out as
if you were together in the same room
play together or compete in online
multiplayer
games honestly it's a very Nintendo
feature based on how they've been like
advertising the switch and stuff like
that you know whether they're like all
of their ads are just a bunch of very
cool Attractive people in their 20s
having really cool lives and being at
parties and then busting out the switch
and then everyone plays together all
together anytime
anywhere game
chat what did you think
in developing game chat our goal was for
you to enjoy playing online with others
more closely including family and
friends almost as if you're all playing
together in the same place honestly I
think it's cute and if there's a use
case for it that's saw it's not for
Nintendo switch 2
camera which will be available on the
same day as Swit 2 the entire like
render of the switch there just vibrate
a Nintendo switch online membership will
be required to use game
chat however okay as long as it wasn't
me and my in demons experience game CH
it will be available without a
membership for a limited time we hope
you'll try it
out that's cool additionally game chat
the Nintendo switch parental controls
app and different settings can be
adjusted for example whether parental
permission is always required when a
child wants to use game chat to play
with their
friends we'd like to introduce another
new experience you can share with family
and friends
Nintendo switch I like how we're getting
clues as to when the switch 2 will be
out based on like the DAT they're giving
in other things it's like the free
period is this time it's like okay so
the switch is not coming out after that
time one with game share as shown here
even games that
scre person owns a compatible game with
game share you can temporarily share
compatible games with others who also
have Nintendo switch 2 or a Nintendo
switch system you can share a game with
up to three other systems at a
time game share also supports online
play with other switch 2 systems and you
can use it with friends via game chat
which we showed
earlier game share can only be used with
compatible games this feature is planned
for several titles starting with a free
update for Clubhouse games 51 worldwide
Classics on Nintendo switch oh yeah game
share support is also planned for select
games exclusive to switch to so we hope
you'll look forward to it up
next we'd like to show you the Nintendo
switch 2 system
itself please take a
look I'm looking I'm
looking at 7.9 in switch 2 has a bigger
built-in screen here's how that compares
to Nintendo switch the system's
thickness Remains the Same
[Music]
with approximately double the pixels
compared to switch you can enjoy games
in Greater detail on the 1080p
screen is the video delayed possibly by
how
much if it's like 100 milliseconds then
that's frames per second allowing for
smoother gameplay and supported
titles audio up a couple of seconds the
LCD screen I did know that the English
translation on the providing more
contrast between light dark areas of the
[Music]
images the allnew joy-con 2 controllers
connect
magnetically strong magnets keep the
controllers firmly attached to the
system detach your controller easily by
pressing the release button on the
back I got so stun locked by the uh
audio delay thing I didn't see some of
these features what did they say it was
and Sr buttons are big for greater
comfort and control when playing with a
joyon 2 held
horizontally
8120 sticks are now
larger I'm going to Mario Kart with like
no delay
whatsoever each joy-con 2 controller can
be used as a mouse to play with
compatible games what both the left and
right joycon 2 support Mouse controls
by adjusting the audio balance between
the ranges sounds from the built-in
speakers are clearer and more natural in
handheld and tabletop
modes they eqed it it has a built-in
microphone so you can voice chat with
friends anytime via game chat it also
uses noise cancelling technology to
filter sounds so your voice will come
through
clearly even if you don't have a
surround sound system games can be
enjoyed with more immersive
three-dimensional sound as if it were
coming from all around
you place your Nintendo switch 2 however
you like with a large sturdy stand you
can move it freely like this
in addition to the USBC Port found on
the bottom of the system there's one on
top as
well what can I use it it's handy for
connecting a USBC
camera or charging and tabletop
mode Nintendo switch 2 comes with 256 GB
of internal storage eight times that of
Nintendo switch for storing your game
downloads with the switch cges thck and
more reading and writing data is also
faster 4 nintend Swit 2 DOC to connect
to your TV and enable up to 4K
resolution for compatible games HDR is
also supported in TV mode
the Nintendo switch 2 doc has a built-in
fan that keeps your system cool this
helps keep performance
stable let's
meet on Nintendo switch 2 you can play
Nintendo switch 2 games as well as
compatible Nintendo switch games
physical and digital games are
supported I like that they told us we
can play Nintendo switch 2 games on our
new Nintendo switch too I love you
Nintendo it'll be interesting to see
which ones are and aren't compatible as
you just saw Nintendo switch 2 isn't
simply an improved Nintendo
switch we redesigned the system from the
ground up and packed in lots of new
gameplay
features and to help players better I
don't know the idea of sliding the
joycon up and down on a Surface like
that making me uncomfortable Mr
kaoto hello hi my current location is
actually inside the game
itself this is Nintendo switch 2 Welcome
tour exclusive to Nintendo switch
2 I'm standing over
here okay everyone join me that's not a
me
though there are a lot of question mark
icons here let's examine them
I mean there's audio delay for the
talking sections I think it's fine where
are the
magnets the joycon 2 controllers
attached to the system with magnets and
those magnets are inside the
system the SL and Sr buttons on the
joycon 2 are made of
metal so that's how they to the
system a magnetic circuit is formed
between them so they won't easily detach
through examining signs like I mean
there's probably some level of delay to
some of the sound effects CU I have a
delay on my stream another example
because of audio that I told you guys
about before and when combined with the
have one and then I have an
added 210 milliseconds onp the golf club
and aim for the Cup by rotating the
joyon 2 for sinking
Reasons by combining the mouse controls
and the 31 months thank you
than there are secrets to discover even
as you're playing mini games and Tech
demos some of the secrets range from the
unique features of the system to Tiny

third parties now and it still kind of
Peters out into nothing by the end we'll

that's not bloodb what am I looking

this vampire
born I don't
know that was that was the yokaro mask
wasn't it what am I looking
[Applause]
at is this them being like L now the
moon as beer the soon to
depart I pray that you are able carrier
of blood
[Music]
what the moon tears will flow for
[Music]
one and one
alone is this just from software getting
pissed off with Sony like cucking the
hell out of bloodborne and they were
like fine we'll make a new
one what the [ __ ] is
this
rat Raven rat thatat
rat only on
switch [ __ ] is this
you don't know if I'm happy I don't know
how I feel I'm so
confused I think I'm
happy honestly that did genuinely feel
like a middle finger to bloodborne
situation right now
Herby
[Music]
gby thank goodness it's Kirby I'm always
safe with Kirby I understand
Kirby Kirby's not going to do anything
weird what
[Music]
[Music]
it's him
[Music]
[Music]
one more Nintendo how could you possibly
up what you just did how could you
[Music]
[Music]
I heard a
who I don't
know Donkey Kong that sounds like Donkey
Kong
[Music]
[Music]
terrain
destruction holy [ __ ]
we're
[Music]
rich that's awesome oh my God that's so
[Music]
cool in 2D segments
take
[Music]
bana and it back now do you remember
when I was like yo it's okay Nintendo
are going to announce the bloodborne
port and silk song in the switch
showcase I don't know what to do
anymore so much for the so confused
you think Sony are calling PR software
disloyal [ __ ]
options
nintend that's
cool in terms of gameplay it's probably
more night rain but in terms of
aesthetic it's like 700% bloodborne
apart from maybe the dinosaur that
popped up at some point
wait where's the
price what's the price
Nintendo how much will you take me for a
Nintendo they know they have me because
they're giving me not
bloodborne if there's no price it's free
so it's
okay I don't know how I feel Chad I feel
I feel confused and lightheaded and and
uncertain about my place in the
world did did the American broadcast
were they any less confusing about what
the [ __ ] we just saw hold on I need to
make sure that I turned off my
uh react window there so I don't do
myself later there we
go like it it was weird because in terms
of gameplay it didn't look all that
bloodborn
but aesthetically it looked very
bloodborne it's like vampire
bloodborne up thank you for the 58
months thank you thank
you look like a mix of everything yeah
that's fair but
like I mean it it will not actually it
will not actually be bloodborne because
yes Sony Sony bloodborne but I do feel
like there's some kind of incentive
there or motivation there because we've
had like what we've been drip fed all
that stuff where Miyazaki was talking
about how he's aware of the desire for
bloodborne but doesn't know what's up
with Sony or and so on and so forth and
then suddenly he's like yeah I'm going
to do this game that looks a lot like
bloodborne aesthetically but it's with
Nintendo it kind it kind of feels like
very calculated
there so
I'm I'm exciting excited for
that it's
true will this game also be be stuck on
the console release absolutely because
it's now they they it's now exclusive to
a Nintendo console and that's never
leaving the Nintendo console with with
with Sony there was always a chance and
not with this
never
perfect I yeah so song only having like
10 seconds in it well no 3 seconds in a
Sizzle reel was interesting but I'm
guessing they didn't have much to show
if it's coming out this year I feel like
they should have more to show so I'm
still somewhat
concerned pre-order starts on the eth
prices are wait what why didn't we get
it as part of the
direct wait why was why was the why was
the price not in the
[Laughter]
direct I don't believe
you store nintendo.co it looks like a
fake
link actually store.
nintendo.co is [ __ ] dying right now
it's it's not loading for
[Music]
me I I don't I don't
know I don't know how can I I've got
I've got I've got like a I've got a dog
training session right after this how do
I go back to life as it was how do I go
back to life as it was before finding
out about not
[Music]
bloodborne you are now in the queue for
the my Nintendo store number of users in
the queue ahead of you
16,898 your estimated wait time is 10
minutes okay
I yeah no I don't I don't know how to
feel I don't I don't know how to feel
I'm excited I'm excited it's also
incredibly [ __ ] funny that this was
their solution it was like we fine we'll
just do bloodborne ourselves
again but I think I think I think it'll
be slightly different I I
think cuz yeah gameplay wise it looked
very different there was like a robot
farting its way across the sky so it
won't be entirely nearly the same it
honestly looked a little bit like lies
of PE Meats
bloodborne you want me to post this in
in Discord okay it's it's very low
quality like image wise but there you go
it doesn't look any better on the one
that I have it's still very
smooshed yeah honestly a lot of chat was
guessing Castlevania before like more of
the
dropped but no very excited to see what
happens there I
uh I don't I don't I don't know I think
it I think it's going to be very funny I
think I think the whole like new cycle
around it is going to be very funny
because it is it's not Shameless like it
it just feels like this was like you
know we'll do it ourselves [ __ ] it
whatever you you you've you you've
trapped him
she said born from my blood no I think I
added that she said something from my
blood and I said I said born I think or
unless she actually did say born from my
blood honestly I don't remember what
happened anymore I feel like I had like
a heart attack Midway through that oh
she said I give you my blood and I said
born
[Laughter]
afterwards man I'm going to have to get
a Nintendo console it w it probably
won't be a launch title what time what
time did they or what day did they said
that it was going to be coming out if
it's not a launch title then I don't
have to like have a [ __ ] meltdown but
I don't get
one 2026 okay that's fine then it'll be
fine by
then graphic thank you for the 100 bits
thank you thank
you it's being marketed as a multiplayer
game yeah it's fine it's fine if it
feels very much like the monkeyy Paw of
bloodborne wishes I'm look I'm looking
forward to uh to the internet's reaction
at large but I have to go I have dog
training in 20 minutes so I have to go
get dressed and take some more
painkillers um it it was awesome
watching the thing with you like I
honestly really enjoyed a lot of the
stuff that was shown during that direct
I think it's going to be great Mario
looked great the the console itself
looked great I don't think I'll ever
touch that Community or chat button or
whatever the [ __ ] the cocka button I
won't touch the cocka button in my life
it's going to be one of those things I
accidentally press and then get really
annoyed because it starts something up
that I didn't want to use it's going to
be fine whatever I'm I'm looking forward
to it I'm excited to finally have a new
Nintendo switch console that will
definitely not be outdated in terms of
like Hardware performance and
immediately get left
behind oh my goodness sh thank you so
much for the raid we're finishing up as
well I have dog trading I'm sorry do I
have your permission to send your
Raiders on to a new friend who
