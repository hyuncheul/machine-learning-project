the item they get or by their
cart. Mumu Meadows. Look at that. We
stand
cows. Mario Kart
World. I like that name. These maps look
sick. Depending on the time of day and
weather conditions, the atmosphere will
change. That's me,
bro. What the hell? You can go off the
racetrack and drive virtually everywhere
in this world. Open world. What? I don't
even understand how that would work in a
race situation, though. This is so sick.
Be eighth or better then you get knocked
out. That's sick. If you're below the
place, you'll be eliminated. You weren't
in the top eight. Oh, dude. This is
going to be so fun with members.
Oh, we're going to do so much member
content with this.
Free roam. You can also free. Just go
for a drive in free roam.
What the [ __ ] This is so cute. The

It's like Discord built in. Did you see
something just like go? Dude, that's
sick. Wow. So, they're just like
removing the middleman.
Dude, when we do member content chat, we
can all just get captured on stream
through this. That's amazing. No matter
what game we're playing. Isn't that
crazy that like this has existed on Xbox
with parties like from 2005?
You know what I mean? And there's this.
Wow. They're They're putting a webcam
built in. Connecting this camera to the

Oh, that is so cool. It's like built
into the game. What the [ __ ]
No, this is motion chat. This is motion.
That's so sick. Nintendo Nintendo, stop
going up, boys. It's cool that it
automatically green screens you, too.
Massive [ __ ] W in my opinion, dude.
Massive. Wonder how much that camera is
going to cost. It's got to be over 100
bucks, right? Surely. 150. Oh, let's go.
We love accessories on the same day. Oh,
wow. Ends March 31st, 2026. When does
this thing come out then? What? With
game share, you can temporarily share
compatible games with others who also
have Nintendo Switch 2 or a Nintendo
Switch. That's [ __ ] sick. That is
nice. Three other systems at a time.
That is nice, dude. They're popping off.
I mean, it makes Dude, it makes sense
that they're popping off no new consoles
in 2017. They knew they had to come with
some cool [ __ ] Game share support is
also, dude, so like you can get Mario
Party and then [ __ ] share it to all
of your friends to play Mario Party.
That's amazing. This is awesome. I love
the magnetic controllers connect. Way
more premium in my opinion. Oh, that's
nice. Comfort and control when playing.
Taking feedback, baby. They're going to
make so much money. This
They're going to make so much money if
the games are on point, dude. They're
They're locked and loaded. Two USB ports

headphone jack. That's actually sick.
Andy Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256 GB
of internal storage, eight times that of
Nintendo Switch for storing your games,
downloads, save data, and more. That's
[ __ ] awesome. 4K dock for compatible
games. HDR is also supported in TV mode.
Beautiful. I love how they're only
showing Mario Kart. Are we only going to
get the Mario Kart news today? There's
no way. They got to talk about more
games. They have to. Well, they're not
going to like drop other games in this
trailer before they announce them.
Hello. Oh, boy. My current location is
actually inside the game itself.
This is Nintendo Switch 2 welcome tour
exclusive to Nintendo Switch 2. Is it a
game just to teach you about the
console? Nintendo Nintendo always does
this cute [ __ ] man. I You got to
respect it, dude. Mario Party games are

Well, we got one new game so far on the
same day as Nintendo Switch 2. Yeah,
baby. Can't wait to play tour. Please
note their

compatible. Oh [ __ ] never mind.
Additionally, they're making a really
cool Star Wars. Dude, the Switch looks
so archaic. Isn't that crazy? We're also
releasing a new Pro. I love it. I love
it. It's so modernized.
Pro control. Yes. Yes. I love those back
buttons.
[ __ ] yes. I'm sorry. I'm most excited
about that. I love the Pro Controller.
And after today's presentation, the
official Nintendo I'm buying two of
them. No one can stop me. Dude, I'm
actually so emotional today. I don't get
emotional a lot with my meds these days.
If we get a new Mario game, man, I'm
losing it. Nintendo Switches on June

accessed on Twitch, too. Yo, Bridget and
T, dude. Oh, I cannot wait for this.
This is actually the coolest thing that

ever done this.
Hit blocks to collect the most coins.

makes the image more vibrant. Bro, can
you imagine if they fix Scarlet and
Violet? They have to, right, dude? They
are [ __ ] They're going in right now.
Very cool having the app connect to the
game. It's like you literally have like
an actual rom
that can help you play through the game.
That's very cool. I'm shocked they're
doing so much. Honestly, I feel like
companies usually hold [ __ ] off for like
future stuff. It seems like Nintendo
took every idea that they've had in the
last 10 years. They're like, "Yep, 2025,
we're just launching it all." Oh, Kirby.
If they're doing Kirby, we have to see
Pokemon get better.
Exclusive in addition to standard. Oh,

drunk. I'm not sure if it's the caffeine
or what the [ __ ] going on. Bikini
Bottom [ __ ] skateboarding. Take my
[ __ ] money. It's James Bond.
It
is. No [ __ ] way. Bravery default. Set
foot.
Bravery default. Let's go. Dude, they
are dropping so many new games. Dude,
how are we getting another Zelda game,
dude? I feel like we just got Tears of
the Kingdom. Am I [ __ ] smoking crack?
Hyrule
Warriors: Age of
Imprisonment. I mean, that just [ __ ]
rolls off the tongue. Nice age of
imprisonment. Yo, I just want to hear.
Woohoo.

actually going to get his Donkey Kong
game today? Chat, how much time's left
on this thing? Undertale
vibes. This Delta Ruins the sequel or
the prequel?
Oh, it's just a parallel story. I'm not
even joking. If they end with a new
Mario game, this might be the best
direct they've ever done. This is
[ __ ] crazy. She got nice hands.
Humanity's very dust. Him, on the other
hand, bros cooked. Oh [ __ ] This is
