hey guys Mar gek in this video I'm going
to share a little unboxing and Hands-On
gameplay of MLB the Show 25 for the
Nintendo switch here it is so I just got
this today of course the game came out
today but of course I'm doing a little
bit late cuz I had to work but here it
is I see here apparently it does come
with collectible cards it says one out
of three from these three players it is
going to require download I hate when
they put this in the fr why put that in
the front when you're already saying it
over here in the back it says that it's
going to require at least 30 GB one four
player one four player one player in
handheld mode and like see right here
little description there and um let
going see in the
inside I hate when there's so much up
download but we're already used to this
so no surprise there and here it is in
the inside oh look at this we do get a
card and um the cover on the inside is
black this right here says 5,000 stubs
there you go so I got 5,000 stubs now I
did not pre-oder it I just got it and
that's it I just walked into the store
and got it uh so we got this card right
here look at that from Paul skin is a
skin not bad very nice looking card now
of course randomly there's going to be a
different card inside of the case and I
don't don't know how long that's going
to last maybe it's the first wave of
games but hopefully it stays like that
forever right everybody can get at least
one random card so of course is is
available
digitally um it says over here download
size if you get it digital it says 29.9
GB which is very similar to what we're
going to get here with the card and in
the inside here I got Mortal Combat cuz
uh the T1000 came came up and I I I
think I want to try it out so let me
know in the comments if you want to see
gameplay for that and let's go and see
of course we're going to have to
download game playay here so I'm going
to be back once this finishes
downloading okay finally we finish
installing this game oh my God I got to
say the Nintendo switch 2 needs to have
faster freaking internet cuz the switch
one I always have a problem that the
speed is slow as hell it doesn't matter
if it's connected via wired or not uh so
here like you see the size is actually
23. three not bad 23.3 the Box actually
said 30 GB uh now another thing we
should not forget to do and we won't be
able to do after March 24 is my rewards
make sure you um redeem those coins
because starting March 24 I already
already did upload a video we won't be
able to do this which kind of sucks okay
so now we got our 60 Points redeem
points which I never do on video kind of
sucks that I'm doing it right now
because we are ending that service uh
which is this Monday which kind of sucks
okay so let's go ahead we have here I
like this cover looks very nice start
screen here they go here animations very
nice now I already did load up the game
just to actually turn off the music

more options I forgot to press more
options there so select here let's see
it says favorites these are uh yeah
Yankees is right there contenders
underdogs and long shots well I got to
go with this one cuz my team is the
Yankees so we're got to go with the
yanies dynamic you can choose Dynamic
beginner or amateur I like d Dynamic and
let's go ah and confirm let's see how
this starts I like so far the animation
very nice and smooth
uh one thing to keep in mind for those
inity from the first pitch in the
American leag East where yeah let me go
and skip that cuz a lot of times you do
get hit by copyright for showing those
damn video clips but like you show there
are very nice
intro so one thing that I forgot to show
tell you guys is that if uh if you've
been playing this game on Xbox game pass
it kind of sucks me because this is
actually the first year that this game
is skipping Game Pass so if you want to
play it on Xbox you actually have to pay
the full price kind of sucks because
they you know since day one since it
came out on on Xbox it it was on Xbox
game pass
but I don't know I had a feeling that
was not going to be
Fork Yankees the crowd is amped
up as volum the
way opening
day there
you that looks so damn good man if this
looks this good here it's got to look
incredible on the PlayStation 5 or
Xbox you know but it does look pretty
good here let's go and
Skip as in most march to October
episodes today's actions will begin in
the mid to late Innings you are now
taking control in the top of the eight
six set for the start of the inn and
stepping in okay batter hun and code got
it pitcher confidence energy okay since
we're starting for the first time this
is letting us know okay
theable and that's through there for a
strike one one well we're expecting to
see strikeouts in this one Cole is in
the 2000 strikeout club and only
needed okay we got tutoral here around
17 Inns to
get okay got
it you know only Chris S and Pedro
Martinez needed fewer Innings to reach
2,000
strikeouts he was all over that one
smash that one through the infield for
the knock when it's hit that hard it
makes it very on the to make any
of now
Andre
dude got on the okay now one the top of
it's kind of annoying at the beginning
there getting all these tutorials but
there you have
it as ACH you know the on second is
ready to things with his speed a base
hit probably going to be a big so like
the
midd here comes
the1 and there's a ball go ahead run it
second here on opening day
Checker sang and a ball lifted in the
air fors it in on the run and there's
two
down score is 0 Z right
now than that you feel like a wide
receiver playing
football fre at the plate now that's
Ball
[Applause]
wall swing in a ground ball base hit
right field to First safe Runners at the
corners after the infield
single and now it's William
conteras just
[Applause]
missed with the goahead run at third and
we're the top half of the
six this one in the dirt well done
behind the
dish come on strike one strike
one that's the strike is closer to
getting out of the
[Applause]
ja Fly ball to right ch is under There
He Go nice that's the third out not bad
not bad almost got in danger
there bottom of the in bottom the six
judge Aaron
judge which I'm a little bit pissed with
him because he didn't show up for this
for the last uh postseason timeout we
got uh okay yeah I know we got
disabled forget you want to Pro timeout
just T right there and time out
[Music]
Bas contact bunt power only joh Carlos
ston has hit more with greater exit
velocity than Jud look out though you
know these Yankees looking to string
together better at bats when they have
Runners on but it just hasn't happened
for them yet they only have one hit with
runners in scoring position so a lot
of I don't see um the hitting
feature is it because I'm playing let me
see okay I don't find that feature there
now I don't know
if and it's fou off wait a
second J Carlo stanson what the
hell what the
hell he's with the Mets
now how did this did not get updated
the other way fre makes the grab and
there's two gone how the hell did this
the lineup did not get updated when I
loaded up the game it actually did that
online roster update and it didn't
update
that chases that one upstairs he's got
to be Prett this so far sometimes guys
cower coming into a ballpark like this
but he is a tack hitter pitching on the
like this very impressive this has been
a treat to watch so okay oh wait a
second we got guess pitches that's
that's not the same as a that's not the
same as it's a three up three down Inn
Ambush
pitting what inning are we ready to go
for the last half of the Inn last half
of theody
Bing we bun just like that
got
it foul ball
there let's go
Yankees and that one pulled foul this a
good job let me see something man I'm
trying to see if I can change game play
get here timing Zone
directional let's go with uh timing this
is Zone let's see
that disrup timing okay there you go so
now we got Ambush
here now we got
Ambush there you go just make sure uh
you have it on Zone and then you can
actually access
the did not work for
me that did not work for
mey for three in this one so there you
go so for example if I want to guess
out and see that the PC I think got big
SW a line slicing right fi but it was
out man that's one of those ADV bats
where you have to remind yourself about
the process he did everything right
I'm going to gu
out no it got big there it got
bigger no misses and it's two
and that fast up right there you're
looking for something you see well that
you can handle but you also have to keep
the discipline I guess correctly but it
was it was a
ball yeah normally they're going to
pitch him
out so if I guess correctly see it got
bigger
oh
oh oh yes look at
that it's
[Applause]
21 now here's John Carlos St what the
hell is John Carlos Stanton doing
here and that's outside I don't get it
that's one not aitch to there isn't a
bad thing he's with a first pitch up
there outside again you see that you see
that that one F hard the other
[Applause]
way swinging a Miss at a
slider that's out again
[Applause]
that was bad is 11 strike out in this
really racking up the whs okay so we got
a home run there Yan um kind of sucks
that uh Garr
Mitchell right through there for a
strike misses just off the outside edge
I think that was a strike
so yeah just make sure if you want to
use uhoh this is a home run I
think and out of here it's out of here
his first hom of the year and they boost
their lead it's
[Applause]
31 next to hit Joseph Ortiz the home
R first pitch doesn't find the Zone just
got to delete it you give up that lead
off home run go back to work Focus on
this next pattern that's down and in
same thing goes with the pitching I can
also change the pitching style let's go
back to gam play uh hitting interface
PCI
anchor uh
plate base running and pitching we got
classic meter pinpoint and pulse let me
see I think that I I actually like that
one
too I choose here see and you got to
just hit the button when the circle get
smaller that
way ler to Second and picked on theop on
first I actually do like the posting
pitching let me know in the comments
which is your
favorite uh pitching uh
meter and immediately pumps in a strike
to the left-handed
hitter just late next pitch is outside
there's a
[Applause]
strike stays
alive
good in the left field and touch for a
base hit so man aboard now one
away welcome back okay so here we ski to
the last inning cuz this video is
getting
long so we're losing in this game
strike got to put up more of a fight in
this one
line on
the
the guess out and if you guess correctly
like see the PCI actually gets bigger
in the Box here let that one like you
see here if we go over here is smaller
over here is bigger so that means you
guess correctly but it's a bad ball but
you still have to pay attention if it's
a good pitch or a pad pitch cuz if it's
a bad
pitch okay we guess correctly as
well this one in the
left that was a good hit right
there here in the bottom of the ninth
one out Goldie will
hit first PCH misses that was not guess
correctly guess outside
again you see that gets
bigger that didn't work there because
that was an inside pitch and it
actually gas
smaller oh swings and misses that is
strike
two in the dirt block no
no I was going to steal the base but he
actually got the ball pretty
fast after the foul
that one the other way and there's a hit
we got a hit right
there they fired in quickly so it's
first and second with only one
away two strikes now a huge in this game
coming
up and now Oswaldo Cabrera but I
wouldn't expect many pitches up in the
zone they'll be pitching for a double
play in this spot
oh oh foul foul oh damn it damn
it I needed
that swing and that's a strike out and
an excellent job keeping it right there
damn big spot here bottom of the N down
to their final out Jason Dominguez now
at the plate
come on
Jason
really really we went too
far ball right side and foul
B the Yanks down to their final strike
on the ground to the left and that's
just
foul mhm come on 0 and two this is the
last out the tying run at the plate oh
damn
it oh wait everybody save everybody
[Applause]
save okay change
pictures Bing bases are loaded Cody
Bellinger come on
Cody come on
Cody let's guess out will we cat
correctly
oh that is out of so they're all loaded
up okay come
on oh come
on
oh oh damn it damn it that was a good
hit but it was
caught it was caught that was good hit
so we opening day we lost our first game
