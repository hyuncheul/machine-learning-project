pause to make this game truly
competitive and fun they should make it
so you start with a cart and you can
modify a little bit and add stats up and
down so what you can do is that you can
use let's say small wheels and give it a
little bit more top speed and lose
acceleration and have a cool little
combo like that okay think about that
and you can use the big carts in lower
top speed or weight wait and then get
some some acceleration and make it fun

fantasy chat listen it it says okay you
know what Chad is I'm saying something
that's going to sound weird chat and
maybe I'm wrong but I don't think I'm
wrong hold on it speaks volumes about a
game's quality in build and how it's
coded and made if it's high quality or
not the fact this game is a technical
achievement and actually pretty
demanding and what it does
and it's still being ported to a a
switch 2 console and looks pretty decent
because the game is initially made
properly but a lot of games are coded
like [ __ ] spaghetti dog [ __ ] code trash
internship unpaid garbage and it's not
portable cuz the [ __ ] is trash together
they get trapped in their own stories
and it's up to you and a friend to help

years or whatever $100 and people were
like riding in the

whoa whoa I voted for this
just wait and then we were going to say
Trump's Mario Trump's Mario this is
Trump's Nintendo just
he and if you say how could we have no
though how no
no okay chat
Bas get chck if you if you would to take
it here's a take J that will age well
through the years Trump's Mario if you
were to take the game quality and game
size and effort and and how much people
are going to play it replayability and
all that and scale it to how much you
should be paying and then you use this
game 80 bucks Mario Kart as your
benchmark then you would make the
argument that GTA 6 would probably
Justified making the game
$300 and it would still be an overall
better price for what you're getting
compared to Mar
$80 that's it that's the that that's the
opinion of course then will never sell
again for $300 but that's legitimately
true how much time you how much time you
going to spend in the game how much time
you going to play it but how much is rep
playability how much you're going to use
the online services online lobbies free
DLC free [ __ ] uh new added [ __ ] new
replaying the game how much let's be
honest it's $300 plus if you were to
make this The Benchmark but people won't
people won't listen to any arguments
because the standard is um scan the
consumer because the consumer is branded
